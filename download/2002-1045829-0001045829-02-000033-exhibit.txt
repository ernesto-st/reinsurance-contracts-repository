                 SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1.   SCOPE OF SERVICES
The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members
in accordance with all applicable Federal, State and local laws,
rules, regulations and policies, including services listed in
this document, listed by reference in attachments, and AHCCCS
policies referenced in this document.  The services are described
in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 2 and the AHCCCS Medical
Policy Manual (AMPM), except for provisions specific to the Fee-
for-Service program, all of which are incorporated herein by
reference and may be found in the Bidder's Library.  The covered
services are briefly described below.  Covered services must be
medically necessary and provided by, or coordinated with, a
primary care provider, except for behavioral health and
children's preventive dental services.  Services must be rendered
by providers that are appropriately licensed or certified,
operating within their scope of practice, and registered as an
AHCCCS provider.  The Contractor shall provide the same standard
of care for all members regardless of the member's eligibility
category.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted
or inhibited in any way from communicating freely with members
regarding the members' health care, medical needs and treatment
options even if needed services are not covered by the
Contractor.

KidsCare Covered Services: Effective 10/1/01:  KidsCare members
are eligible for the same services covered for members under the
Title XIX program.

Ambulatory Surgery and Anesthesiology:  The Contractor shall
provide surgical services for either emergency or scheduled
surgeries when provided in an ambulatory or outpatient setting
such as a free-standing surgical center or a hospital based
outpatient surgical setting.

Audiology:  The Contractor shall provide audiology services to
members under the age of 21 including the identification and
evaluation of hearing loss and rehabilitation of the hearing loss
through medical or surgical means (i.e. hearing aids).  Only the
identification and evaluation of hearing loss are covered for
members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due
to an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

Behavioral Health:  The Contractor shall provide behavioral
health services as described in Section D, Paragraph 2,
Behavioral Health Services.

Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS):  The program for
children with CRS-covered conditions is administered by the
Arizona Department of Health Services (ADHS) for children who
meet CRS eligibility criteria.  The Contractor shall refer
children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-
22, Article 2 A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3.  Eligibility
criteria and the referral process are described in the CRS Policy
and Procedures Manual available in the Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall monitor referrals to CRS to ensure CRS
covered services are provided in a timely manner to eligible
members.  Referral to CRS does not relieve the Contractor of the
responsibility for providing medically necessary services not
covered by CRS to CRS eligible members. The Contractor is also
responsible for initial care of newborn members, until those
members become enrolled in CRS .  The Contractor must require the
member's Primary Care Provider (PCP) to coordinate their care
with the CRS program.  All services provided must be included in
the member's medical record maintained by the PCP.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS.
If the member uses their private insurance network for a CRS
covered condition, and the member is not enrolled with CRS, the
Contractor is responsible for all applicable deductibles and
copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision
of all covered services to its members, except for instances in
which the CRS eligible member refuses to receive CRS covered
services through the CRS program.  If the Contractor becomes
aware that CRS has failed to meet the established appointment
standards, or has failed to provide medically necessary CRS
covered services, the Contractor shall immediately notify
AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, of the occurrence.  In
accordance with the CRS appointment standards policy, the
Contractor may seek reimbursement from CRS for providing CRS
covered services.

Chiropractic Services:  The Contractor shall provide chiropractic
services to members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's
PCP and approved by the Contractor in order to ameliorate the
member's medical condition.  Medicare approved chiropractic
services shall also be covered, subject to limitations specified
in CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if prescribed
by the member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

Dental:  The Contractor shall provide all members under the age
of 21 with all medically necessary dental services including
emergency dental services, dental screening and preventive
services in accordance with the AHCCCS periodicity schedule,
therapeutic dental services, dentures, and pre-transplantation
dental services.  The Contractor shall monitor compliance with
the EPSDT periodicity schedule for dental screening services and
ensure that dental service reports are included in the member's
medical record maintained by the PCP.  The Contractor is required
to meet specific utilization rates for members as described in
Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Standards.  The Contractor
shall ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are
due if the member has not been scheduled for a visit.  If no
dental screening is received by the member, a second notice must
be sent.  Members under the age of 21 may request dental services
without referral and may choose a dental provider from the
Contractor's provider network.  For members who are 21 years of
age and older, the Contractor shall provide emergency dental
care, medically necessary dentures and dental services for
transplantation services as specified in the AMPM.  Dental
standards may also be found in the AMPM.

Dialysis:  The Contractor shall provide medically necessary
dialysis, supplies, diagnostic testing and medication for all
members when provided by Medicare-certified hospitals or Medicare-
certified end stage renal disease (ESRD) providers.  Services may
be provided on an outpatient basis, or on an inpatient basis if
the hospital admission is not solely to provide chronic dialysis
services.

Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT):
The Contractor shall provide comprehensive health care services
through primary prevention, early intervention, diagnosis and
medically necessary treatment to correct or ameliorate defects
and physical or mental illness discovered by the screenings for
members under age 21.  The Contractor shall ensure that these
members receive required health screenings, including
developmental/behavioral health, in compliance with the AHCCCS
periodicity schedule (included in the AMPM) and to submit to the
AHCCCS Office of Medical Management all EPSDT reports as required
by AHCCCS medical policy.  The Contractor is required to meet
specific participation/utilization rates for members as described
in Section D, Paragraph 16, Performance Standards.  Because
behavioral health benefits for Title XIX and Title XXI members
are provided through the ADHS/RBHA system, the Contractor shall
ensure the initiation and coordination of the referral of these
members to the RBHA and shall follow up with the RBHA to monitor
whether members have received behavioral health services

Emergency services: The Contractor shall have and/or provide the
following as a minimum:

a.   Emergency services facilities adequately staffed by
     qualified medical professionals to provide pre-hospital,
     emergency care on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week basis, for the
     sudden onset of a medically emergent condition as defined by
     AHCCCS Rule R9-22-101 and R9-31-101.  Emergency medical services
     are covered without prior authorization.  The Contractor is
     encouraged to contract with emergency service facilities for the
     provision of emergency services.  The Contractor is encouraged to
     contract with or employ the services of non-emergency facilities
     (e.g. urgent care centers) to address member non-emergency care
     issues occurring after regular office hours or on weekends.  The
     Contractor shall be responsible for educating members and
     providers regarding appropriate utilization of emergency room
     services including behavioral health emergencies.  The Contractor
     shall monitor emergency service utilization (by both provider and
     member) and shall have guidelines for implementing corrective
     action for inappropriate utilization.  For utilization review,
     the test for appropriateness of the request for emergency
     services shall be whether a prudent layperson, similarly
     situated, would have requested such services.  For purposes of
     this contract, a "prudent layperson" is a person who possesses an
     average knowledge of health and medicine.

b.   All medical services necessary to rule out an emergency
     condition

c.   Emergency transportation

d.   Member access by telephone to a physician, registered nurse,
     physician assistant or nurse practitioner for advice in emergent

services in accordance with the AMPM, for all members who choose
to delay or prevent pregnancy.  These include medical, surgical,
pharmacological and laboratory services, as well as contraceptive
devices.  Information and counseling necessary to allow the
members to make informed decisions regarding family planning
methods shall also be included.  If the Contractor does not
provide family planning services, it must contract for these
services through another health care delivery system, which
allows members freedom of choice in selecting a provider.  A
prospective offeror may discuss arrangements for family planning
services only with other prospective offerors during the RFP
process for the purpose of making arrangements for the provision
of family planning services.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the
Family Planning Services Extension Program; a program that
provides only family planning services for a maximum of 24 months
to women whose SOBRA eligibility has terminated.  The Contractor
is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a SOBRA woman is
sterilized to prevent inappropriate enrollment in the SOBRA
Family Planning Services Extension Program.  Notification may be
made at the time the newborn is reported or after the
sterilization procedure is completed.

Health Risk Assessment and Screening:  The Contractor shall
provide these services for non-hospitalized members 21 years of

sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS;
nutritional assessment in cases when the member has a chronic
debilitating disease affected by nutritional needs; mammograms
and prostate screenings; physical examinations and diagnostic
work-ups; and immunizations. Required assessment and screening
services for members under age 21 are included in the AHCCCS
EPSDT periodicity schedule.

Home Health:  The Contractor shall provide part-time or
intermittent care for members who do not require hospital care.
This service is provided under the direction of a physician to
prevent re-hospitalization or institutionalization and may
include nursing, therapies, supplies and home health aide
services.

Hospice:  These services are covered for members under 21 years
of age who are certified by a physician as being terminally ill
and having six months or less to live.  See the AMPM for details
on covered hospice services.

Hospital:  Inpatient services include semi-private accommodations
for routine care, intensive and coronary care, surgical care,
obstetrics and newborn nurseries, and behavioral health
emergency/crisis services.  If the member's medical condition
requires isolation; private inpatient accommodations are covered.
Nursing services, dietary services and ancillary services such as
laboratory, radiology, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, blood
and blood derivatives, etc. are also covered.  Outpatient
services include any of the above services, which may be provided
on an outpatient or ambulatory basis (i.e. laboratory, radiology,
therapies, ambulatory surgery, etc.).  Observation services may
be provided on an outpatient basis for up to 24 hours if
determined reasonable and necessary to decide whether the member
should be admitted for inpatient care.  Observation services

Indian Health Services (IHS):  The Contractor may choose to
subcontract with and pay an IHS or 638 tribal facility as part of
their provider network for covered services provided to members.
The Contractor is responsible for reimbursement to IHS or tribal
facilities for emergency services provided to  Title XXI Native
American members enrolled with the Contractor.  AHCCCSA will
reimburse claims on a FFS basis to providers for acute care

Federal reimbursement, and that are provided to Title XIX members
in an IHS or a 638 tribal facility.

Laboratory:  Laboratory services for diagnostic, screening and
monitoring purposes are covered when ordered by the member's PCP,
other attending physician or dentist, and provided by a CLIA

Upon written request, a Contractor may obtain laboratory test
data on members from a laboratory or hospital based laboratory
subject to the requirements specified in A.R.S.  36-2903(R) and
(S).  The data shall be used exclusively for quality improvement
activities and health care outcome studies required and/or
approved by the Administration.

Maternity:  The Contractor shall provide pre-conception
counseling, pregnancy identification, prenatal care, treatment of
pregnancy related conditions, labor and delivery services, and
postpartum care for members.  Services may be provided by
physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or
certified nurse midwives. Members may select or be assigned to a
PCP specializing in obstetrics.  All members anticipated to have
a low-risk delivery may elect to receive labor and delivery
services in their home from their maternity provider if this
setting is included in allowable settings for the Contractor, and
the Contractor has providers in its network that offer home labor
and delivery services.  All members anticipated to have a low-
risk prenatal course and delivery may elect to receive maternity
services of prenatal care, labor and delivery and postpartum care
provided by licensed midwives if they are in the Contractor's
provider network.  All licensed midwife labor and delivery
services must be provided in the member's home since licensed
midwives do not have admitting privileges in hospitals or AHCCCS
registered free-standing birthing centers.  Members receiving
maternity services from a licensed midwife must also be assigned
to a PCP for other health care and medical services. The
Contractor shall allow women and their newborns to receive up to
48 hours of inpatient hospital care after a routine vaginal
delivery and up to 96 hours of inpatient care after a cesarean
delivery.  The attending health care provider, in consultation
with the mother, may discharge the mother or newborn prior to the
48-hour minimum length of stay.  A normal newborn may be granted
an extended stay in the hospital of birth when the mother's
continued stay in the hospital is beyond the 48 or 96 hour stay.

The Contractor shall inform all assigned AHCCCS pregnant women of
voluntary prenatal HIV testing and the availability of medical
counseling if the test is positive. The Contractor shall provide
information in the member handbook and annually in the member
newsletter to encourage pregnant women to be tested and
instructions on where to be tested.  Semi-annually, the
Contractor shall report to AHCCCS the number of pregnant women
who have been identified as HIV/AIDS positive.  This report is
due no later than 30 days after the end of the second and fourth
quarters of the contract year.

Medical Foods:  Medical foods are covered within limitations
defined in the AMPM for members diagnosed with a metabolic
condition included under the ADHS Newborn Screening Program and
specified in the AMPM. The medical foods, including metabolic
formula and modified low protein foods, must be prescribed or
ordered under the supervision of a physician.

Medically-Necessary Pregnancy Terminations:  AHCCCS covers
pregnancy termination when it is the result of rape or incest, or
in circumstances where the member suffers from a physical
disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life
endangering physical condition caused by or arising form the
pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, place
the member in danger of death unless the pregnancy is terminated.
In addition, providers must submit to the Contractor a
Certificate of Medical Necessity for Pregnancy Termination.
Prior authorization is required.  If the procedure is performed
on an emergency basis, documentation, outlined in the AMPM, is
required for a member under eighteen years of age or a member who
is considered an incapacitated adult who seeks a medically
necessary pregnancy termination, as defined above.

Medical Supplies, Durable Medical Equipment (DME), Orthotic and
Prosthetic Devices:  These services are covered when prescribed
by the member's PCP, attending physician or practitioner, or by a
dentist.  Medical equipment may be rented or purchased only if
other sources are not available which provide the items at no
cost.  The total cost of the rental must not exceed the purchase
price of the item.  Reasonable repairs or adjustments of
purchased equipment are covered to make the equipment serviceable
and/or when the repair cost is less than renting or purchasing
another unit.

Nursing Facility:  The Contractor shall provide services in
nursing facilities, including religious nonmedical health care
institutions, for members who require short-term convalescent
care not to exceed 90 days per contract year.  In lieu of a
nursing facility, the member may be placed in an assisted living
facility or alternative residential setting, or receive home and
community based services (HCBS) as defined in R9-22, Article 2
and R9-28, Article 2 that meet the provider standards described
in R9-28, Article 5, and subject to the limitations set forth in
the AMPM.

Nursing facility services must be provided in a dually-certified
Medicare/Medicaid nursing facility which includes in the per-diem
rate: nursing services, basic patient care equipment and sickroom
supplies, dietary services, administrative physician visits, non-
customized DME, necessary maintenance rehabilitation therapies,
over-the-counter medications, social, recreational and spiritual
activities, and administrative, operational medical direction
services.  The Contractor shall provide medically necessary
nursing facility services for any member who has a pending ALTCS
application, who is currently residing in a nursing facility and
is eligible for services provided under this contract.  If the
member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS
Program Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days of
nursing facility coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for
nursing facility coverage during the time the member is enrolled
with the Contractor.  Nursing facility services covered by a
third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member is
enrolled with the Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day
limitation.  See Paragraph 36, Nursing Facility Reimbursement,
for further details.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the
Division of Member Services in writing when a member has been
residing in a nursing facility for 75 days.  This will allow
AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS application
and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the stay
goes beyond the 90-day maximum.

Nutrition:  Nutritional assessments may be conducted as a part of
the EPSDT screenings for members under age 21, and to assist
members 21 years of age and older whose health status may improve
with nutritional intervention.  Assessment of nutritional status
on a periodic basis may be provided as determined necessary, and
as a part of the health risk assessment and screening services
provided by the member's PCP.  AHCCCS covers nutritional therapy
on an enteral, parenteral or oral basis, when determined
medically necessary to provide either complete daily dietary
requirements, or to supplement a member's daily nutritional and
caloric intake and when AHCCCS criteria specified in the AMPM are
met.

attending physician or dentist and dispensed under the direction
of a licensed pharmacist are covered subject to limitations
related to prescription supply amounts, Contractor formularies
and prior authorization requirements, as well as restrictions for
immunosuppressant drugs addressed in AHCCCS medical policies for
transplantations.  Appropriate over-the-counter medication may be
prescribed when it is determined to be a lower-cost alternative
to prescription medication.

Primary Care Provider (PCP):  PCP services are covered when
provided by a physician, physician assistant or nurse
practitioner selected by, or assigned to, the member.  The PCP
provides primary health care and serves as a gatekeeper and
coordinator in referring the member for specialty medical

primary medical record, which contains documentation of all
health risk assessments and health care services of which they
are aware whether or not they were provided by the PCP.

are provided for diagnosis, prevention, treatment or assessment
of a medical condition.  Services are generally provided in
hospitals, clinics, physician offices and other health care

occupational, physical and speech therapies.  Therapies must be
prescribed by the member's PCP or attending physician for an
acute condition and the member must have the potential for
improvement due to the rehabilitation.  Occupational and speech
therapies are only covered on an inpatient basis for those
members who are 21 and over; physical therapy for all members and
occupational and speech therapies for members under the age of 21
are covered on both an inpatient and outpatient basis if not used
as a maintenance regimen.

Respiratory Therapy:  This therapy is covered on an inpatient or
outpatient basis when prescribed by the member's PCP or attending
physician and is necessary to restore, maintain or improve
respiratory functioning.

Transplantation of Organs and Tissue, and Related
Immunosuppressant Drugs:  These services are covered within
limitations defined in the AMPM for members diagnosed with
specified medical conditions.  Such limitations include whether
the stage of the disease is such that the transplant can affect
the outcome; the member has no other conditions that
substantially reduce the potential for successful
transplantation; and whether the member will be able to comply
with necessary and required regimens of treatment. Bone grafts
are also covered under this service.  Services include pre-
transplant inpatient or outpatient evaluation; donor search;
organ/tissue harvesting or procurement; preparation and
transplantation services; and convalescent care.  In addition, if
a member receives a transplant covered by a source other than

provided within limitations after the discharge from the acute
care hospitalization for the transplantation.   AHCCCS has
contracted with transplantation providers for the Contractor's
use or the Contractor may select its own transplantation
provider.

Transportation:  These services include emergency and non-
emergency medically necessary transportation.  Emergency
transportation, including transportation initiated by an

be associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is
established.  The Contractor shall require the PCP to respond to
RBHA/provider information requests pertaining to ADHS enrolled

attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  The Contractor shall
make available, on the Contractor's formulary, medications for
the treatment of these disorders.

The Contractor shall ensure that training and education is
available to PCPs regarding behavioral health referral and
consultation procedures.  The Contractor shall establish policies
and procedures for referral and consultation and shall include

reference into this contract.  The Contractor is responsible for
complying with the requirements set forth within.  The AMPM with
search capability and linkages to AHCCCS rules, Statutes and
other resources is available to all interested parties through
the AHCCCS Home Page on the Internet (www.ahcccs.state.az.us).

the Internet at the beginning of each month.  If required, the
Contractors may receive one hard copy of the AMPM, free of
charge, from AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, however, the

4.   VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM

Federal legislation passed in 1993 (OBRA 93) amended Title XIX of
the Social Security Act and created the Vaccine for Children
(VFC) program which became effective 10/1/94.  Through this
program, the Federal and State governments purchase, and make
available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19.  Therefore, the Contractor shall not
utilize AHCCCS funding to purchase vaccines for members under the
age of 19. If vaccines are not available through the VFC Program,
the Contractor shall contact AHCCCS, Office of Medical
Management, Clinical Quality Management Unit.  Any provider,
licensed by the State to administer immunizations, may register
with ADHS as a "VFC provider" and receive free vaccines.  The
Contractor shall comply with all VFC requirements and monitor its
providers to ensure that, if providing immunizations to AHCCCS
members under the age of 19, the providers are registered with
ADHS/VFC.

5.   DENIALS OR REDUCTIONS OF SERVICES

When any covered service subject to prior authorization is
denied, reduced, suspended or terminated, the Contractor shall
comply with the notice, request for hearing and continuation of
benefit requirements specified in 42 CFR 431.200, et seq.,
A.A.C. R9-22-Article 13 and R9-31-Article 13, and the AHCCCS
Member Rights and Responsibilities Policy.  This information must
be explained in the Member handbook provided for each member by
the Contractor.  The Contractor is required to promptly provide
any services specified in the AHCCCS Director's decisions,
irrespective of whether or not a Petition for Rehearing is filed.
Also, refer to Attachment H, Grievance and Request for Hearing
Process and Standards.

6.   ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT

AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll
members.  The Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any
reason unless directed to do so by AHCCCSA.  Eligibility for the
various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined by one of the
following agencies:

Social Security           	SSA determines eligibility for the
Administration (SSA)      	Supplementary Security Income (SSI)
		                  cash program.  SSI cash recipients are
	                        automatically eligible for AHCCCS
	                        coverage.

Department of Economic    	DES determines eligibility for the
Security (DES)	            families with children under section
		                  1931 of the Social Security Act,
	                        pregnant women and children under
	  	                  SOBRA, the Adoption Subsidy Program,
		                  Title IV-E foster care children, Young
		                  Adult Transition Insurance Program,
		                  the Federal Emergency Services program
		                  (FES), HIFA parents and the Title XIX
		                  Waiver Members, including the State
		                  Emergency Services (SES) program.

AHCCCSA                   	AHCCCSA determines eligibility for the
		                  SSI/MAO groups, including the FES
		                  program for this population (aged,
		                  disabled, blind), the Arizona Long-
		                  Term Care System (ALTCS), the
		                  Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program
		                  and other Medicare cost sharing
		                  programs, BCCTP, the Ticket to Work
		                  program, the Title XXI KidsCare
		                  program, and HIFA parents.

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with Contractors in
accordance with the rules set forth in R9-22, Article 17, and R9-
31-306, 307, and 309.

Health Plan Choice

Title XIX members, including Title XIX waiver members, have a
choice of available health plans.  A listing of the available
health plans and their telephone numbers will be given to each
applicant during the application process for AHCCCS benefits.
Also included are instructions to applicants to call the health
plans directly with specific questions concerning the health
plan.  If there is only one health plan available for the
applicant's Geographic Service Area, no choice is offered.
Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA's being notified of
their eligibility are automatically assigned to a health plan
based on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm. See
Section 61 for further explanation of the auto-assignment
algorithm.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX members
include: previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled
for less than 90 days will be automatically enrolled with the
same Contractor, if that Contractor is still available.  Also,
women who are eligible for the Family Planning Services Extension
Program will automatically remain assigned to the same health
plan.  The Family Planning Services Extension Program provides a
maximum of 24 months of family planning services.  Refer to the
Division of Member Service (DMS) enrollment policy for additional
exceptions.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX member with
the Contractor will generally be the day prior to the date the
Contractor receives notification from AHCCCSA via the daily
roster.  However, the Contractor is responsible for payment of
medically necessary covered services retroactive to the member's
beginning date of eligibility.

Title XXI members must select a health plan prior to being
determined eligible and therefore, will not be auto-assigned.
When a member is transferred from Title XIX to Title XXI and has
not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the member will
remain with the Title XIX health plan and a choice notice will be
sent to the member.  The member may then change plans no later
than 16 days from the date the choice notice is sent.  Refer to
Paragraph 72 for information regarding HIFA parents.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member will be
the first day of the month following notification to the health
plan.  If a Title XXI member is determined eligible by the 25th
of the month, the member will be enrolled with the health plan as
of the 1st of the following month.  If the member is determined
eligible AFTER the 25th of the month, the member will be enrolled
with the health plan as of the 1st of the second following month.

Prior Period Coverage:  AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for
Title XIX members. Prior period coverage starts from the first
day of the month of application, or first eligible month,
whichever is later, to the day a member is enrolled with the
Contractor.  For MED's, prior period coverage is the time period
from the date the member met spenddown to the date of eligibility
approval.  The Contractor is responsible for payment of all
claims for medically necessary covered services provided to
members during prior period coverage. This may include services
provided prior to the contract year (See Section D, Paragraph 37,
Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement
from AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

Newborns:  Newborns born to AHCCCS-eligible mothers, including
Title XXI mothers, who were enrolled at the time of the child's
birth, and whose newborn notification was received by AHCCCSA,
will be enrolled with the mother's health plan.  The Contractor
is responsible for notifying AHCCCSA of a child's birth to an
enrolled member. Capitation for the newborn to the Contractor
will begin on the date notification is received by AHCCCSA
(except for cases of births during prior period coverage).  The
effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the newborn's date
of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered
services to the newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received
notification of the child's birth.  Note that AHCCCSA is
currently available to receive notification calls 24 hours a day,
7 days a week.  Eligible mothers of newborns are sent a letter
advising them of their right to choose a different Contractor for
their child; otherwise the child will remain with the mother's
Contractor.

Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a health plan and
mothers of these newborns are sent a letter advising them of
their right to choose a different health plan for their child.
In the event the FES mother chooses a different health plan,
AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned
plan and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of
birth in the second plan.  The second plan will receive prior
period capitation from the date of birth to the day before
assignment and prospective capitation from the date of assignment
forward.  The second Contractor will be responsible for all
covered services to the newborn from date of birth.

Enrollment Guarantees:  Upon initial capitated enrollment as a
Title XIX-eligible member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of
five full months of continuous enrollment.  Upon initial
capitated enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member, the member
is guaranteed a minimum of 12 full months of continuous
enrollment. Enrollment guarantees do not apply to HIFA parents,
Native Americans who choose to obtain their covered services
through Indian Health Services (IHS) on a fee-for-service basis
or children enrolled with Department of Economic
Security/Comprehensive Medical and Dental Program.  The
enrollment guarantee is a one time benefit for Title XIX and
Title XXI members, except for HIFA parents.  If a member changes
from one Contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee
period, the remainder of the guarantee period applies to the new
Contractor.  The enrollment guarantee may not be granted or may
be terminated if the member is incarcerated or, if a minor child
is adopted.  AHCCCS Rule R9-22, Article 17 and R9-31, Article 3
describes other reasons for which the enrollment guarantee may
not apply.

Native Americans:  Native Americans, on or off-reservation, have
a choice to receive services from Indian Health Services (IHS), a
PL 93-638 tribal facility or any available Contractor.  If choice
is not available or made within the specified time limit, Native
American Title XIX members living on-reservation will be assigned
to IHS.  Native American Title XIX members living off-reservation
will be assigned to an available Contractor using AHCCCSA's
family continuity policy and auto-assignment algorithm.  Native
Americans may change from IHS to a Contractor or from a
Contractor to IHS at any time.  Native American Title XXI members
must make a choice prior to being determined eligible.

7.   MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS

To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall
take affirmative action so that members are provided covered
services without regard to payer source, race, color, creed, sex,
religion, age, national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual
preference, genetic information, or physical or mental handicap,
except where medically indicated. Contractors must take into
account a member's culture, when addressing members and their
concerns, and must take reasonable steps to encourage
subcontractors to do the same.  The Contractor must make
interpreters available for members to ensure appropriate delivery
of covered services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to,
the following:

a.   Denying or not providing a member any covered service or
     access to an available facility.

b.   Providing to a member any covered service which is
     different, or is provided in a different manner or at a different
     time from that provided to other members, other public or private
     patients or the public at large except where medically necessary.

c.   Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in
     any manner related to the receipt of any covered service;
     restricting a member in any way in his or her enjoyment of any
     advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any covered
     service.

d.   The assignment of times or places for the provision of
     services on the basis of the race, color, creed, religion, age,
     sex, national origin, ancestry, marital status, sexual
     preference, income status, AHCCCS membership, or physical or
     mental handicap of the participants to be served.

If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a
provider with the intent of allowing or permitting the
subcontractor to implement barriers to care (i.e. the terms of
the subcontract act to discourage the full utilization of
services by some members), the Contractor will be in default of
its contract.

If the Contractor identifies a problem involving discrimination
by one of its providers, it shall promptly intervene and
implement a corrective action plan.  Failure to take prompt
corrective measures may place the Contractor in default of its
contract.

8.   MEMBER INFORMATION

The Contractor will be accessible by phone for general member
information during normal business hours.  All enrolled members
will have access to a toll free phone number.  All informational
materials prepared by the Contractor shall be approved by AHCCCSA
prior to distribution to members. The reading level and name of
the evaluation methodology used should be included.

All  materials shall be translated when the Contractor  is  aware
that a language is spoken by 3,000 or 10% (whichever is less)  of

Proficiency (LEP) in that language.

All  vital  materials shall be translated when the Contractor  is
aware  that  a  language is spoken by 1,000 or 5%  (whichever  is
less)  of  the  Contractor's members who also have  LEP  in  that
language.   Vital  materials must include, at a minimum,  notices
for denials, reductions, suspensions or terminations of services,
vital information from the member handbooks and consent forms.

All   written  notices  informing  members  of  their  right   to
interpretation  and translation services in a language  shall  be
translated  when  the  Contractor  is  aware  that  1,000  or  5%
(whichever  is  less)  of  the Contractor's  members  speak  that
language and have LEP.

When there are program or service site changes, notification
shall be provided to the affected members at least 14 days before
implementation.  The Contractor shall review and update the
Member Handbook at least once a year. The Handbook must be
submitted to AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care for approval by Sept.
1 of each contract year, or within four weeks of receiving the
annual renewal amendment, whichever is later.

The Contractor shall make every effort to ensure that all
information prepared for distribution to members is written at a

surveys, along with a timeline for the project, shall be approved
in advance by AHCCCS Office of Managed Care, Operations Unit.
The results and the analysis of the results shall be submitted to
the Operations Unit within 45 days of the completion of the
project.  AHCCCSA may periodically conduct a survey of a
representative sample of the Contractor's membership.  AHCCCSA
will design a questionnaire to assess accessibility, availability
and continuity of care with PCPs; communication between members
and the Contractor; and general member satisfaction with the
AHCCCS program.  To ensure comparability of results, the
questions to the members will be the same for all Contractors.

materials.

11.  ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE

AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on
their annual anniversary date.  AHCCCSA may hold an open
enrollment as deemed necessary.  During AEC, members may change
Contractors subject to the availability of other Contractors
within their Geographic Service Area.  Members are mailed a
printed enrollment form and may choose a new Contractor by
contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process.  If the
member does not participate in the AEC, no change of Contractor
will be made (except for approved changes under the Change of
Plan Policy) during the new anniversary year.  This holds true if
the Contractor's contract is renewed and the member continues to
live in the Contractor's service area.  The Contractor shall
comply with the Office of Managed Care Member Transition for
Annual Enrollment Choice and Other Plan Changes policy.

12.  TRANSITION OF MEMBERS

The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM, and the Office of
Managed Care Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice and
Other Plan Changes standards for member transitions between
health plans or GSAs, to or from an ALTCS Program Contractor,
IHS, a PL 93-638 tribal entity, and upon termination or
expiration of a contract.  The Contractor shall develop and
implement policies and procedures, which comply with AHCCCS
medical policy to address transition of:

a.   Members with significant medical conditions such as a high-
     risk pregnancy or pregnancy within the last 30 days, the need for
     organ or tissue transplantation, chronic illness resulting in
     hospitalization or nursing facility placement, etc.;

     home health, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy or who are
     hospitalized at the time of transition;

c.   Members who have received prior authorization for services
     such as scheduled surgeries, out-of-area specialty services,
     nursing home admission;

d.   Prescriptions, DME and medically necessary transportation
     ordered for the transitioning member by the relinquishing
     Contractor; and

e.   Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost of
     reproducing and forwarding medical records shall be the
     responsibility of the relinquishing AHCCCS Contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for
timely notification of the receiving Contractor regarding
pertinent information related to any special needs of
transitioning members.  The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible to
coordinate care with the relinquishing Contractor in order that
services not be interrupted, and for providing the new member
with health plan and service information, emergency numbers and
instructions of how to obtain services.

In the event the contract, or any portion thereof, is terminated
for any reason, or expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA
in the transition of its members to other Contractors, and shall
abide by standards and protocols set forth above.  In addition,
AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the contract on
a month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of members.
The Contractor shall make provision for continuing all management
and administrative services until the transition of all members
is completed and all other requirements of this contract are
satisfied.  The Contractor shall be responsible for providing all
reports set forth in this contract and necessary for the
transition process and shall be responsible for the following:

a.   Notification of subcontractors and members.

b.   Payment of all outstanding obligations for medical care
     rendered to members.

     (1) A monthly claims aging report by provider/creditor
     including IBNR amounts;

     (2) A monthly summary of cash disbursements;

     (3) Copies of all bank statements received by the
         Contractor.

d.   Such reports shall be due on the fifth day of each
     succeeding month for the prior month.

e.   In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by
     AHCCCSA, such termination or suspension shall not affect the
     obligation of the Contractor to indemnify AHCCCSA for any claim
     by any third party against the State or AHCCCSA arising from the
     Contractor's performance of this contract and for which the
     Contractor would otherwise be liable under this contract.

f.   Any dispute by the Contractor with respect to termination or
     suspension of this contract by AHCCCSA shall be exclusively
     governed by the provisions of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

g.   Any funds advanced to the Contractor for coverage of members
     for periods after the date of termination shall be returned to
     AHCCCSA within 30 days of termination of the contract.

13.  STAFF REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPORT SERVICES

     law regarding advance directives for adult members.  Requirements
     include:

  (1)  Maintaining written policies that address the rights of
       adult members to make decisions about medical care, including the
       right to accept or refuse medical care, and the right to execute
       an advance directive.  If the agency/organization has a
       conscientious objection to carrying out an advance directive, it
       must be explained in policies.  (A health care provider is not
       prohibited from making such objection when made pursuant to
       A.R.S.  36-3205.C.1.)

  (2)  Provide written information to adult members regarding each
       individual's rights under State law to make decisions regarding
       medical care, and the health care provider's written policies
       concerning advance directives (including any conscientious
       objections).

  (3)  Documenting in the member's medical record whether or not
       the adult member has been provided the information and whether an
       advance directive has been executed.

  (4)  Not discriminating against a member because of his or her
       decision to execute or not execute an advance directive, and not
       making it a condition for the provision of care.

  (5)  Providing education to staff on issues concerning advance
       directives including notification of direct care providers of

     advanced directive, or documentation of refusal, to the member's
     PCP for inclusion in the member's medical record.

16.  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

All Performance Standards described below apply to all member
populations.

Contractors must meet AHCCCS stated Minimum Performance
Standards.  However, it is equally important that Contractors
continually improve their performance indicator outcomes from
year to year.  Contractors shall strive to meet the ultimate
standard, or Benchmark, established by AHCCCS.

Any statistically significant drop in the Contractor's
performance level for any indicator must be explained by the
Contractor in its annual quality management program evaluation.
If a Contractor has a significant drop in any indicator without a
justifiable explanation, it will be required to submit a
corrective action plan and may be subject to sanctions.

AHCCCS has established three levels of performance:

  Minimum Performance Standard - A Minimum Performance Standard
  is the minimal expected level of performance by the
  Contractor.   If a Contractor does not achieve this standard,
  the Contractor will be required to submit a corrective action
  plan and may be subject to sanctions.  If the rate for any
  indicator declines to a level below the AHCCCS Minimum
  Performance, the Contractor will be required to submit a
  corrective action plan and may be subject to sanctions.

  Goal - A Goal is a reachable standard for a given performance
  indicator for the Contract Year.  If the Contractor has
  already met or exceeded the AHCCCS Minimum Performance
  Standard for any indicator, the Contractor must strive to meet
  the CYE 2003 Goal for the indicator(s).

  Benchmark - A Benchmark is the ultimate standard to be
  achieved.  Contractors that have already achieved or exceeded
  the Goal for any performance indicator must strive to meet the
  Benchmark for the indicator(s).  Contractors that have
  achieved the Benchmark are expected to maintain this level of
  performance for future years.

A Contractor that has not shown demonstrable and sustained
improvement toward meeting AHCCCS Performance Standards shall
develop a corrective action plan.  The corrective action plan
must be received by the Office of Medical Management within 30
days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS.  This plan must be
approved by AHCCCS prior to implementation.  AHCCCS may conduct
one or more follow-up onsite reviews to verify compliance with a
corrective action plan.  Failure to achieve adequate improvement
may result in sanction imposed by AHCCCS.

Performance Indicators:  For CYE 2003, the Contractor shall
comply with AHCCCS quality management requirements to improve
performance for all AHCCCS established performance indicators.
Complete descriptions of these indicators can be found in the
Technical Specifications section of the most recently published
Health Plan Performance Standards Results and Analysis documents
for perinatal, pediatric and adult/adolescent services.  For CYE
2002, the indicator for postpartum visits was eliminated as a
contractual performance standard.  The Contractor shall continue
to monitor rates for postpartum visits and implement
interventions as necessary to improve or sustain its rates.  This
activity will be monitored by AHCCCS during the annual
Operational and Financial Review.

In addition, AHCCCS has established standards for the following
indicators:

EPSDT Participation:  The Contractor shall take affirmative steps
to increase member participation in the EPSDT program.  The
participant rate is the number of children younger than 21 years
receiving at least one medical screen during the contract year,
compared to the number of children expected to receive at least
one medical screen.  The number of children expected to receive
at least one medical screen is based on the AHCCCS EPSDT
periodicity schedule and the average period of eligibility.

Pediatric immunizations:  The Contractor shall ensure members
under age 21 receive age-appropriate immunizations as specified
in the AMPM.

The Contractor shall participate in an annual immunization audit
based on random sampling to assess and verify the immunization
status of two-year-old members.  AHCCCS will provide the
Contractor the selected sample, specifications for conducting the
audit, the AHCCCSA reporting requirements, and technical
assistance.  The Contractor shall identify each child's PCP,
conduct the assessment, and report to AHCCCS in the required
format all immunization data for the two-year-old children
sampled.  If medical records are missing for more than 5 percent
of the sample group, the Contractor is subject to sanctions by
AHCCCSA.  An External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) may
conduct a study to validate the Contractor's reported rates.

The following table identifies the Minimum Performance Standards,
Goals and Benchmarks for each indicator:

Performance				CYE 03 Minimum	    CYE 03	Benchmark*
Indicator				Performance Standard  Goal	(Healthy
					People Goals)

     providers, including physicians, physician assistants and nurse
     practitioners within the scope of their practice, without a
     referral for preventive and routine services.  Any waiver of this
     requirement by the Contractor must be approved in advance by
     AHCCCSA.
b.   Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment
     for a medical condition other than that for which the member was
     referred, unless approved by the member's PCP.
c.   The specialty physicians shall provide to the member's PCP
     complete documentation of all diagnostic services including
     copies: of test results; if applicable; treatment services
     provided; and the resulting outcome for each.

The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is
designated for each pregnant member for the duration of her
pregnancy and postpartum care and that maternity services are
provided in accordance with the AMPM.  The Contractor may include
in its provider network the following maternity care providers:

a.   Arizona licensed allopathic and/or osteopathic physicians
     who are general practitioners or specialize in family practice or
     obstetrics
b.   Physician Assistants
c.   Nurse Practitioners
d.   Certified Nurse Midwives

Members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetric
care (physician or certified nurse midwife).  Such assignment
shall be consistent with the freedom of choice requirements for
selecting health care professionals while ensuring that the
continuity of care is not compromised.  Members who choose to
receive maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be
assigned to a PCP for medical care as primary care is not within
the scope of practice for licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform
deliveries shall have OB hospital privileges.  Licensed midwives
perform deliveries only in the member's home.  Labor and delivery
services may also be provided in the member's home by physicians,
certified nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who
include such services within their practice.

24.  NETWORK DEVELOPMENT

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that
is sufficient to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members.
It shall ensure covered services are provided promptly and are
reasonably accessible in terms of location and hours of
operation.  There shall be sufficient personnel for the provision
of covered services, including emergency medical care on a 24-
hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis.  The proposed network shall be
sufficient to provide covered services within designated time and
distance limits.  For Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this
includes a network such that 95% of its members residing within
the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson do not have
to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP, dentist or pharmacy.
95% of its members residing outside the boundary area must not
have to travel more than 10 miles to see such providers.  See
Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for details on
network requirements by Geographic Service Area.  Also see
Section D, Paragraph 35, Hospital Subcontracting and
Reimbursement, for details on changes in hospital subcontracting
effective October 1, 2001.

Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Contractor shall not
discriminate with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program,
reimbursement or indemnification against any provider based
solely on the provider's type of licensure or certification.
This provision, however, does not prohibit the Contractor from
limiting provider participation to the extent necessary to meet
the needs of the Contractor's members.  This provision also does
not interfere with measures established by the Contractor to
control costs consistent with its responsibilities under this
contract.

25.  NETWORK MANAGEMENT

The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that
pertain to all service specifications described in the AMPM.  In
addition, the Contractor shall have policies on how the
Contractor will:
a.   Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/or
     program changes and requirements
b.   Monitor and control network compliance with policies and
     rules of AHCCCSA and the Contractor, including compliance with
     all policies and procedures related to the grievance process and
     ensuring the member's care is not compromised during the
     grievance process
c.   Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network
d.   Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services
     should the network become temporarily insufficient within the
     contracted service area
e.   Monitor network capacity to ensure that there are sufficient
     providers to handle the volume of members
f.   Ensure service accessibility, including monitoring
     appointment procedures standards, appointment waiting times, and
     service provision standards.

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be
approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.  A
material change is defined as one, which affects, or can
reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability to
meet the performance and network standards as described in this
contract.  The Office of Managed Care must be notified of planned
material changes in the provider network before the change
process has begun, for example before issuing a 60-day
termination notice to a provider.  The notification shall be made
within one working day if the change is unexpected.  AHCCCSA will
assess proposed changes in the Contractor's provider network for
potential impact on members' health care and provide a written
response to the Contractor within 14 days of receipt of request.
For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care,
within one working day of any unexpected changes that would
impair its provider network.  This notification shall include (1)
information about how the change will affect the delivery of
covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining
the quality of member care if the provider network change is
likely to result in deficient delivery of covered services.

26.  FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH  CENTERS (FQHC)

The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide
covered services and must comply with the Federal mandates.
Section 4712(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget Act requires that
"rates of payment between FQHCs/RHCs and MCOs shall not be less
than the amount of payment for a similar set of services with a
non-FQHC/RHC."  The intention of this provision is to ensure that
contractors negotiate rates of payment with FQHCs that are
comparable to the rates paid to providers that provide similar
services.

In compliance with the Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of
2000 (BIPA), AHCCCSA established a baseline Prospective Payment
System (PPS) rate for each FQHC.  AHCCCSA will adjust the PPS
rate annually using the Medicare Economic Index (MEI).  AHCCCSA
will perform, within 5 months of contract year-end, an annual
reconciliation using encounter and reimbursement data submitted
by Contractors and FQHCs.  The reconciliation is a comparison of
the total reimbursement to total eligible encounters valued at
the PPS rate.

Contractors are required to submit member information for Title
XIX members for each FQHC on a quarterly basis to AHCCCS Office
of Managed Care.  AHCCCSA and the FQHCs have agreed that AHCCCSA
will reimburse each FQHC for Title XIX members, on a quarterly
basis, a per member per month (pmpm) rate that was calculated by
inflating the 2001 PPS rate.  AHCCCSA will perform periodic
audits of the member information submitted.  Contractors should
refer to the Office of Managed Care's policy on FQHC
reimbursement for further guidance.  The following FQHCs are
currently recognized by CMS:

          Canyonlands Community Health Care
          Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc.
          Clinica Adelante, Inc.
          Desert Senita Community Health Center
          El Rio Health Center
          Inter-Tribal Health Care Center
          Marana Health Center
          Mariposa Community Health Center, Inc.
          Mountain Park Health Center
          Native American Community Health Center, Inc.
          Native Americans for Community Action Family Health Center
          North Country Community Health Center
          Sun Life Family Health Center
          Sunset Community Health Center (formerly Valley Health Center, Inc.)
          United Community Health Center, Inc.

Any other clinics that subsequently become FQHC's will be subject
to the reimbursement methodology described above.

27.  PROVIDER REGISTRATION

The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors
register with AHCCCSA as an approved service provider and receive
an AHCCCS Provider ID Number.  A Provider Participation Agreement
must be signed by each provider who does not already have a
current AHCCCS ID number.  The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA.  This provider registration process must be completed in
order for the Contractor to report services a subcontractor
renders to enrolled members and for the Contractor to be paid
reinsurance.

28.  PROVIDER AFFILIATION  TRANSMISSION

The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its
provider network.  This information shall be submitted in the
format described in the Provider Affiliation Transmission User
Manual on October 15, January 15, April 15, and July 15 of each
contract year.  The Manual may be found in the Bidder's Library.

29.  PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS

AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its CMS grant award,
requires periodic reports, encounter data, and other information
from the Contractor.  The submission of late, inaccurate, or
otherwise incomplete reports shall constitute failure to report
subject to the penalty provisions described in this contract.
Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports
are as follows:

     a.   Timeliness:   Reports or other required data shall be
          received on or before scheduled due dates.
     b.   Accuracy:   Reports or other required data shall be prepared
          in strict conformity with appropriate authoritative sources
          and/or AHCCCS defined standards.
     c.   Completeness:  All required information shall be fully
          disclosed in a manner that is both responsive and pertinent to
          report intent with no material omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and
frequency of submission of reports are subject to change at any
time during the term of the contract.  The Contractor shall
comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting
beyond the term of the contract.  For example, processing claims
and reporting encounter data will likely continue beyond the term
of the contract because of lag time in filing source documents by
subcontractors.

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting
requirements contained in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health
Care Contractors with the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment
System, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library.
The required reports, which are subject to change during the
contract term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report
Requirements.

30.  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the
dissemination of information prepared by AHCCCSA or the Federal
government to its members.  The cost of such dissemination shall
be borne by the Contractor.  All advertisements, publications and
printed materials that are produced by the Contractor and refer
to covered services shall state that such services are funded
under contract with AHCCCSA.

31.  REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract,
request financial or other information from the Contractor.  Upon
receipt of such requests for information, the Contractor shall
provide complete information as requested no later than 30 days
after the receipt of the request unless otherwise specified in
the request itself.

32.  OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS

AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews
on all successful offerors and will, subject to the availability
of resources, provide technical assistance as appropriate.  The
Readiness Reviews will be conducted prior to the start of
business. The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess new
Contractors' readiness and ability to provide contract services
to members at the start of the contract year and current
Contractors' readiness to expand to new geographic service areas.
A new Contractor will be permitted to commence operations only if
the Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's satisfaction.

33.  OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

In accordance with CMS requirements, AHCCCSA will conduct regular
Operational and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but not
limited to) ensuring operational and financial program
compliance.  The Reviews will identify areas where improvements
can be made and make recommendations accordingly, monitor the
Contractor's progress towards implementing mandated programs and
provide the Contractor with technical assistance if necessary.
The Contractor shall comply with all other medical audit
provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review
will be solely at the discretion of AHCCCSA.  Except in cases
where advance notice is not possible or advance notice may render
the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least
three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site review.  In
preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews,
the Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA
Review Team by forwarding in advance such policies, procedures,
job descriptions, contracts, logs and other information that
AHCCCSA may request.  The Contractor shall have all requested
medical records on-site.  Any documents not requested in advance
by AHCCCSA shall be made available upon request of the Review
Team during the course of the review.  The Contractor personnel,
as identified in advance shall be available to the Review Team at
all times during AHCCCSA on-site review activities.  While on-
site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team with
workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy
for conferences.  Certain documentation submission requirements
may be waived at the discretion of AHCCCSA if the Contractor has
obtained accreditation from NCQA, JCAHO or any other nationally
recognized accrediting body.  The Contractor must submit the
entire accreditation report to AHCCCSA for such waiver
consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Operational and
Financial Review Report and given an opportunity to comment on
any review findings prior to AHCCCSA publishing the final report.
Operational and Financial Review findings may be used in the
scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that Contractor.
Recommendations made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor
into compliance with Federal, State, AHCCCS, and/or RFP
requirements must be implemented by the Contractor.  AHCCCSA may
conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial Review to determine
the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations and
achieving program compliance.  Follow-up reviews may be conducted
at any time after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the
event the Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change
in ownership or makes changes in three or more key staff
positions within a 12-month period.

34.  CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM

The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system
capable of processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in
accordance with ARS 36-2904(H) and (J), AHCCCS Rules R9-22-705,
and R9-22-709, a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's
Library.  In the absence of a subcontract provision to the
contrary, claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from
the date of service or the effective date of eligibility posting,
whichever is later.  Remittance advices accompanying the
Contractor's payments to providers must contain, at a minimum,
adequate descriptions of all denials and adjustments, the reasons
for such denials and adjustments, the amount billed, the amount
paid, and grievance and request for hearing rights.  The
Contractor's claims payment system, as well as its prior
authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize the
likelihood of having to recoup already-paid claims.  Any
recoupment in excess of $50,000 per provider within a contract
year must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, unless a
subcontract specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall ensure that
90% of all clean claims are paid within 30 days of receipt of the
clean claim and 99% are paid within 90 days of receipt of the
clean claim.  The Contractor shall not require subcontracting
providers to initially submit claims earlier than 6 months after
date of service or to submit clean claims less than 12 months
after date of service for which payment is claimed, unless a
subcontract exists which specifies otherwise.

During the term of this contract, AHCCCSA anticipates requiring
all health plans to use a standardized electronic format for
electronic claims processing between the plan and its providers.
AHCCCSA plans to require the formats outlined in the Technical
Interface Guidelines under Claims Processing, which is the format
adopted by CMS FFS providers and their billing agents who submit
claims electronically to AHCCCS.  The form UB-92 and 1500 layouts
will be supplemented by a Form C layout.  All formats are subject
to changes as required by Federal law.  Reasonable implementation
timeframes will be negotiated with each plan.

35.  HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT

Maricopa and Pima counties only:  Legislation authorizes the
Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective
from October 1, 2001, through September 30, 2003.  The Pilot as
defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-718 requires hospital subcontracts
to be negotiated between health plans in Maricopa and Pima
counties and hospitals to establish reimbursement levels, terms
and conditions.  Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the
Contractor and hospitals to cover operational concerns, such as
timeliness of claims submission and payment, payment of discounts
or penalties, legal resolution, which may, as an option, include
establishing arbitration procedures.  These negotiated
subcontracts shall remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to
ensure availability of quality services within specific service
districts, equity of related party interests, reasonableness of
rates.  The general provisions of this program encompass acute
care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that
result in an admission.  The Contractor shall submit all hospital
subcontracts and any amendments to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, for prior approval.  For non-emergency patient-days, the
Contractor shall ensure that at least 65% of its members use
contracted hospitals.  AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently
adjust the 65% standard.  Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the
number of emergency days at a particular non-contracted hospital
becomes significant, AHCCCSA may require a subcontract at that
hospital.

All counties EXCEPT Maricopa and Pima:  The Contractor shall
reimburse hospitals for member care in accordance with AHCCCS
Rule R9-22-705.  The Contractor is encouraged to obtain contracts
with hospitals in all GSA's and must submit copies of these
contracts, including amendments, to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, at least seven days prior to the effective dates thereof.

The Contractor may conduct prepayment and postpayment medical
reviews of all hospital claims including outlier claims.
Erroneously paid claims are subject to recoupment.  If the
Contractor fails to identify lack of medical necessity through
concurrent review and/or prepayment medical review, lack of
medical necessity identified during postpayment medical review
shall not constitute a basis for recoupment by the Contractor.
This prohibition does not apply to recoupments that are a result
of an AHCCCS reinsurance audit.  See also Section D, Paragraph
34, Claims Payment System.  For a more complete description of
the guidelines for hospital reimbursement, please consult the
Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and rules.

For Out-of-State Hospitals:  The Contractor shall reimburse out-
of-state hospitals in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705.

36.  NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT

The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the
nursing facility is unable to obtain prior authorization in
situations where acute care eligibility and ALTCS eligibility
overlap and the member is enrolled with an AHCCCS acute care
Contractor.  In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements.  The Contractor's payment
responsibility described above applies only in situations where
the nursing facility has not been notified in advance of the
member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care Contractor.  To
further illustrate, when ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute
care enrollment, the acute care enrollment takes precedence.
Although the member could be ALTCS eligible for this time period,
there is no ALTCS enrollment that occurs on the same days as
AHCCCS acute enrollment.  The Contractor is responsible for
payment of services while the member is enrolled with the
Contractor.  The Contractor is not responsible for the full 90
days per contract year of nursing facility coverage if ALTCS
enrollment occurs before the 90 days has ended.

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility
services for any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who
is currently residing in a nursing facility and is eligible for
services provided under this contract.  If the member becomes
ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an ALTCS Program Contractor
before the end of the maximum 90 days per contract year of
nursing facility coverage, the Contractor is only responsible for
nursing facility coverage during the time the member is enrolled
with the Contractor.  Nursing facility services covered by a
third party insurer (including Medicare) while the member is
enrolled with the Contractor shall be applied to the 90 day per
contract year limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the
Division of Member Services in writing, when a member has been
residing in a nursing facility for 75 days.  This will allow
AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS application
process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if
the stay goes beyond the 90-day per contract year maximum.

37.  COMPENSATION

The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior
Period Coverage (PPC) capitation, prospective capitation,
delivery supplement, hospitalized supplement for Title XIX Waiver
members, HIV-AIDS supplement, reinsurance (PPC and prospective),
and third party liability, as described and defined within this
contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments
to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract
provided that the Contractor's performance is in compliance with
the terms and conditions of this contract.  Payment must comply
with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36.  AHCCCSA reserves the
option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National
Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will
provide the Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the
effective date of any such change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA
shall not be liable for any error or delay in transfer nor
indirect or consequential damages arising from the use of the
electronic funds transfer process.  Any charges or expenses
imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be
borne by the Contractor.  Except for adjustments made to correct
errors in payment, and as otherwise specified in this section,
any savings remaining to the Contractor as a result of favorable
claims experience and efficiencies in service delivery at the end
of the contract term may be kept by the Contractor.

All funds received by Contractor pursuant to this contract shall
be separately accounted for in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted
copayments and third-party liabilities, the only source of
payment to Contractor for the services provided hereunder is the
Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System Fund.  An error
discovered by the State with or without an audit in the amount of
fees paid to Contractor will be subject to adjustment or
repayment by Contractor making a corresponding decrease in a
current Contractor's payment or by making an additional payment
by AHCCCSA to the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned by the
Contractor.  This section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole
option from making payment to a fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

The Contractor or its subcontractors shall collect any required
copayment from members but service will not be denied for
inability to pay the copayment.  Except for permitted copayments,
the Contractor or its subcontractors shall not bill or attempt to
collect any fee from, or for, a member for the provision of
covered services.  Any required copayments collected shall belong
to the Contractor or its subcontractors.

For Title XIX Waiver members, AHCCCS reserves the right to make
prospective capitation rate adjustments if the actual enrollment
or enrollment mix differ materially from the initial estimates
and it affects the actuarial soundness of the rates.

Prior Period Coverage (PPC) Capitation:  The Contractor will be
paid capitation for all PPC member months, including partial
member months.  This capitation includes the cost of providing
medically necessary covered services to members during prior
period coverage.  The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA
and will be paid to the Contractor along with the prospective
capitation described below.  Contractors will not receive PPC
capitation for newborns of members who were enrolled at the time
of delivery.

Prospective Capitation:  The Contractor will be paid capitation
for all prospective member months, including partial member
months.  This capitation includes the cost of providing medically
necessary covered services to members during the prospective
period coverage.  The prospective capitation rates will be set by
AHCCCSA and will be paid to the Contractor along with the PPC
capitation described above.

Reconciliation of PPC Costs to Reimbursement:  Effective for CYE
`03,  AHCCCS will no longer reconcile  PPC costs to
reimbursement.  PPC rates for CYE '03 have been adjusted to
reflect this change.

Risk Sharing for Title XIX Waiver Members:  For CYE `03, AHCCCSA
will reconcile the Contractor's PPC and prospective medical cost
expenses (net of reinsurance, excluding administrative and non-
operating expenses) to PPC capitation, prospective capitation,
and hospitalized supplements (net of administration) paid to the
Contractor during the year.  This reconciliation will limit the
Contractor's losses to 2% and profits to 4%.  Any losses in
excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the Contractor, and likewise,
profits in excess of 4% will be recouped.  Encounter data will be
used to determine medical expenses.

The Contractor may choose to elect an alternative risk sharing
methodology on October 1, 2002 for CYE `03.  In this alternative
risk sharing methodology, AHCCCSA will recoup profits in excess
of 1% and reimburse losses in excess of 1%.  Refer to the Title
XIX Waiver Reconciliation Policy for details of the
reconciliation process.

Delivery Supplement:  When the Contractor has an enrolled woman
who delivers during a prospective enrollment period, the
Contractor will be entitled to a supplemental payment.
Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver in a
prior period coverage time period.  AHCCCSA reserves the right at
any time during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of
this payment for women who deliver at home.

Hospital Kick Payment: If a Title XIX Waiver member is an
inpatient on the date of application for AHCCCS eligibility, and
the date of application falls within the member's eligibility
period, the Contractor is entitled to a supplemental payment to
help defray costs related to the inpatient stay.  The payment is
a one-time supplement that is paid when the member is enrolled
with the Contractor and is subject to review during the term of
the contract.

HIV-AIDS Supplement:  On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall
submit to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, an unduplicated
monthly count of members, by rate code, who are using approved
HIV/AIDS drugs along with the supporting pharmacy log.  The
report shall be submitted, along with the quarterly financial
reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each quarter.
The rate of reimbursement for this separate per member per month
payment is specified in Section B and is subject to review during
the term of the contract.  AHCCCSA reserves the right to recoup
any amounts paid for ineligible members as well as an associated
penalty for incorrect encounter reporting.

Refer to the Office of Managed Care's HIV/AIDS supplemental
payment and review policies for further details and requirements.

38.  CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS

Incentive Fund:  AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of
capitation reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors
based on their performance measure outcomes.  AHCCCSA will notify
Contractors 60 days prior to a new contract year if this
methodology will be implemented and will provide details of the
reimbursement methodology at that time.

Capitation Adjustments:  Except for changes made specifically in
accordance with this contract, the rates set forth in Section B
shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification during the
contract period.  AHCCCSA may, at its option, review the effect
of a program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is
needed.  In these instances the adjustment will be prospective
with assumptions discussed with the Contractor prior to modifying
capitation rates.  The Contractor may request a review of a
program change if it believes the program change was not
equitable; AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance
of any obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option
and in addition to other available remedies, adjust the amount of
payment until there is satisfactory resolution of the default.
The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA and/or AHCCCSA may deduct
from future monthly capitation for any portion of a month during
which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a.   death of a member
b.   member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits
     from the date of incarceration)
c.   duplicate capitation to the same Contractor
d.   adjustment based on change in member's contract type
e.   voluntary withdrawal

If a member is enrolled twice with the same Contractor,
recoupment will be made as soon as the double capitation is
identified.  AHCCCSA reserves the right to modify its policy on
capitation recoupments at any time during the term of this
contract.

39.  REINSURANCE

Regular   Inpatient  Reinsurance:   Reinsurance  is  a  stop-loss
program  provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor  for  the  partial
reimbursement  of  covered  inpatient facility  medical  services
incurred  for a member with an acute medical condition beyond  an
annual  deductible  level.   AHCCCSA  is  self-insured  for   the
reinsurance  program  and  the program  is  characterized  by  an
initial deductible level with a subsequent coinsurance percentage
(see  table below).  The coinsurance percent is the rate at which
AHCCCSA  will  reimburse  the Contractor  for  inpatient  covered
services  incurred above the deductible.  The deductible  is  the
responsibility  of  the  Contractor.  Per  diem  rates  paid  for
nursing  facility services provided within 30 days  of  an  acute
hospital  stay,  including room and board, provided  in  lieu  of
hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year  shall  be
eligible for reinsurance coverage.

Contractor's   statewide  AHCCCS  acute  care   enrollment   (not
including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services) as of October
1st  each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown
in  the  table  above.  These deductible levels  are  subject  to
change  by AHCCCSA during the term of this contract.  Any  change
would  have a corresponding impact on capitation rates.     Refer
to  the  AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual for  further
details on the Reinsurance Program.

A  Contractor  whose  enrollment qualifies  for  the  $35,000  or
$50,000  deductible level may, prior to the start of the contract
period, elect one of the lower deductible levels indicated in the
above  table.   Contractors  may  not  elect  to  increase  their
deductible level.  If a Contractor's actual deductible is $35,000
or  $50,000,  AHCCCSA  will increase the Contractor's  capitation
rate  awarded by defined amounts for each capitation risk  group.
These  specific  capitation adjustments are  available  from  the
Office of Managed Care. (Effective October 1, 2001, the Title XIX
Waiver  Group  is  no longer eligible for prior  period  coverage
reinsurance.)

b)   Prior  Period Coverage Reinsurance:  A separate  reinsurance
deductible  and  coinsurance percentage will apply  during  prior
period  coverage.  As noted in the table above, all  Contractors,
regardless  of enrollment, will be subject to a $5,000 deductible
level.   The coinsurance percentage for the prior period coverage
reinsurance  is  100%.   Expenses incurred  during  prior  period
coverage  will  not  apply  toward  the  prospective  reinsurance
thresholds.   (Effective October 1, 2001, the  Title  XIX  Waiver
Group  will  no  longer  be eligible for  prior  period  coverage
reinsurance.)

c)   Title  XIX  Waiver Members: Effective October,  1,  2001,  a
separate  reinsurance deductible for the Title XIX  Waiver  Group
applies  for both the prospective and prior period coverage  time
periods.  There can only be one reinsurance case for prior period
and prospective enrollment.

Catastrophic  Reinsurance:  The reinsurance  program  includes  a
special    Catastrophic   Reinsurance   program.   This   program
encompasses  members diagnosed with hemophilia, von  Willebrand's
Disease,  and  Gaucher's Disease.    For  additional  detail  and
restrictions  refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance  Claims  Processing
Manual  and  the AMPM.  There are no deductibles for catastrophic
reinsurance  cases.   All  catastrophic  claims  are  subject  to
medical review by AHCCCSA.

The   Contractor  shall  notify  AHCCCSA,  Office  of  Medical
Management,   Reinsurance   Unit,   of   cases   identified   for
catastrophic reinsurance coverage within 30 days of  (a)  initial
diagnosis,  (b)  enrollment  with the  Contractor,  and  (c)  the
beginning  of each contract year.  Catastrophic reinsurance  will
be  paid for a maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of
notification to AHCCCSA.  The determination of whether a case  or
type  of  case is catastrophic shall be made by the  Director  or
designee based on the following criteria; 1) severity of  medical
condition,  including  prognosis; and  2)  the  average  cost  or
average  length of hospitalization and medical care, or both,  in
Arizona for the type of case under consideration.

HEMOPHILIA:    When   a   member   is   identified    as    being
catastrophically  eligible  by  AHCCCSA  due  to   the   specific
diagnosis  of  hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1,  286.2),  all
medically necessary covered services provided during the contract
year   shall  be  eligible  for  reimbursement  at  85%  of   the
Contractor's paid amount.

VON  WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE:  Catastrophic reinsurance coverage  is
available for all members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease
who are non-DDAVP responders and dependent on Plasma Factor VIII.
All  medically  necessary covered services  provided  during  the
contract year shall be eligible for reimbursement at 85%  of  the
Contractor's paid amount.

GAUCHER'S  DISEASE:  Catastrophic reinsurance  is  available  for
members diagnosed with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and
are  dependent  on  enzyme replacement  therapy.   All  medically
necessary  covered  services provided during  the  contract  year
shall  be  eligible for reimbursement at 85% of the  Contractor's
paid amount.

Breast  and  Cervical  Cancer  Treatment  Program  (BCCTP):   The
reinsurance  program  also  covers Contractor  reimbursement  for
BCCTP.  When a member becomes eligible for BCCTP, DMS will notify
the  Office  of Medical Management, Reinsurance Section,  of  the
member's  eligibility so a reinsurance case can  be  established.
The  Contractor  will  be reimbursed for 100%  of  the  medically
necessary costs. There are no deductibles for BCCTP cases nor  is
there a coinsurance percentage.

Transplants:  This program covers members who are  eligible  to
receive  covered major organ and tissue transplantation including
bone  marrow, heart, heart/lung, lung, liver, kidney,  and  other
organ  transplantation.   Bone grafts and cornea  transplantation
services are not eligible for transplant reinsurance coverage but
are  eligible  under  the regular inpatient reinsurance  program.
Refer  to  the  AMPM for covered services for  organ  and  tissue
transplants.   Reinsurance coverage for transplants is limited to
85%  of  the  AHCCCS  contract  amount  for  the  transplantation
services  rendered,  or  85%  of the  Contractor's  paid  amount,
whichever  is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation  rates
may  be found in the Bidder's Library.  When a member is referred
to  a transplant facility for an AHCCCS-covered organ transplant,
the   Contractor   shall  notify  AHCCCSA,  Office   of   Medical
Management.

Effective  October 1, 2002, Contractors will be  reimbursed  100%
for  all  medically  necessary covered  expenses  provided  in  a
contract  year,  after  any type of reinsurance  case,  excluding
transplants, reaches $650,000.

Encounters:

a)   Encounter  Submission: A Contractor shall  prepare,  review,
verify,  certify,  and  submit, encounters for  consideration  to
AHCCCSA.   Upon  submission, the Contractor  certifies  that  the
services listed were actually rendered, medically necessary,  and
within  the  scope  of AHCCCS benefits.  The encounters  must  be
submitted  in  the format prescribed by AHCCCSA.  The  Contractor
must initiate and evaluate an encounter for probable 1st and  3rd
party  liability before submitting the encounter for  reinsurance
consideration,  unless  the encounter  involves  underinsured  or
uninsured  motorist  liability  insurance,  1st  and  3rd   party
liability insurance or a tort feasor.

The  Contractor must maintain evidence that costs  incurred  have
been   paid  by  the  Contractor  before  submitting  reinsurance
encounters.   This  information is  subject  to  AHCCCSA  review.
Collections from 1st and 3rd parties should be reflected  by  the
Contractor as reductions in the encounters submitted on a dollar-
for-dollar basis.  For purposes of AHCCCSA reinsurance,  payments
made  by Contractor-purchased reinsurance are not considered  1st
and 3rd party collections.

All  reinsurance  claims must reach a clean claim  status  within
fifteen  months  from  the  end  date  of  service,  or  date  of
eligibility posting, whichever is later.

b)   Encounter  Processing:  AHCCCSA will accept  for  processing
only  those encounters that are submitted directly by  an  AHCCCS
Contractor  and  that comply with the AHCCCS Encounter  Reporting
User Manual.

c)  Payment of Regular Reinsurance Cases:  AHCCCSA will reimburse
a  Contractor  for  costs incurred in excess  of  the  applicable
deductible  level,  subject to coinsurance  percentages.  AHCCCSA
will  use  inpatient encounter data to determine prospective  and
prior  period  coverage reinsurance benefits.  Reimbursement  for
these  reinsurance benefits will be made to the  Contractor  each
month.   AHCCCSA  will  also  provide  for  a  reconciliation  of
reinsurance  payments in the case where encounters  used  in  the
calculation of reinsurance benefits are subsequently adjusted  or
voided.

Effective  October  1,  1998,  when  a  member  with  an   annual
enrollment choice changes Contractors within a contract year, for
reinsurance  purposes,  all  eligible  inpatient  costs,  nursing
facility costs and inpatient psychiatric costs incurred for  that
member  will  follow  the  member to the receiving  health  plan.
Therefore,  all  submitted encounters from the  health  plan  the
member  is  leaving  (for  dates of service  within  the  current
contract  year)  will  be applied toward,  but  not  exceed,  the
receiving  health plan's deductible level.  For  further  details
regarding this policy and other reinsurance policies refer to the
AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

The amount applied against the deductible shall be determined  by
the  costs  paid  by the Contractor, or if under  a  subcapitated
arrangement, the lower of the AHCCCS fee schedule or the reported
health plan paid amount.

Amounts  in  excess of the deductible level shall be  paid  based
upon  costs paid by the Contractor, minus the coinsurance  unless
the  costs  are  paid  under  a  subcapitated  arrangement.    In
subcapitated   arrangements,  the   Administration   shall   base
reimbursement  of  reinsurance encounters on  the  lower  of  the
AHCCCS  allowed amount or the reported health plan  paid  amount,
whichever  is  lower,  minus  the  coinsurance  and  Medicare/TPL
payment and applicable quick pay discounts.

d)  Payment of Catastrophic and BCCTP Reinsurance Cases:  AHCCCSA
will  reimburse  a  Contractor for all eligible  costs  incurred,
subject  to  coinsurance percentages if applicable. AHCCCSA  will
use   encounter   data   to   determine   reinsurance   benefits.
Reimbursement for these reinsurance benefits will be made to  the
Contractor  each  month.   AHCCCSA  will  also  provide   for   a
reconciliation  of  reinsurance  payments  in  the   case   where
encounters  used in the calculation of reinsurance  benefits  are
subsequently adjusted or voided.

e)   Payment   of  Transplant  Reinsurance  Cases:    Reinsurance
benefits are based upon the lower of the  AHCCCS contract  amount
or   the   Contractor's  paid  amount,  subject  to   coinsurance
percentages.  While  encounter data  is  not  used  to  determine
reinsurance  payments  for transplant services,  Contractors  are
required to encounter all services provided for which a financial
liability  is  incurred.  Please refer to the Reinsurance  Claims
Processing  Manual  for  the appropriate  billing  of  transplant
services.  Reimbursement for these reinsurance benefits  will  be
made to the Contractor each month.

Reinsurance  Audits: AHCCCSA may limit reinsurance  reimbursement
to  a  lower  or  alternative level of care if  the  Director  or
designee  determines that the less costly alternative  could  and
should  have  been  used by the Contractor.   Medical  audits  on
prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance cases  will  be
determined  based  on  statistically valid  retrospective  random
sampling.   AHCCCSA, Office of Medical Management, will  generate
the  sampling  and  will notify the Contractor  of  documentation
needed  for the retrospective medical audit process to  occur  at
the  Contractor's  offices.  Reinsurance  consideration  will  be
given  to  inpatient  facility contracts, and  hearing  decisions
rendered  by the Office of Legal Assistance.  Pre-hearing  and/or
hearing penalties discoverable during the review process will not
be  reimbursed  under reinsurance.  A recoupment  of  reinsurance
reimbursements  made to the Contractor will occur  based  on  the
results  of  the  medical audit sampling.   The  results  of  the
medical  audit  sampling may be separately  extrapolated  to  the
entire   prospective   and  prior  period  coverage   reinsurance
reimbursement  populations  in  the  audit  timeframe   for   the
Contractor.  AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at  least  45  days
advance  notice of any on-site audit.  The Contractor shall  have
all   requested  medical  records  on-site.   Any  documents  not
requested  in  advance by AHCCCSA shall be  made  available  upon
request  of  the Audit Team during the course of the audit.   The
Contractor representative shall be available to the Audit Team at
all  times  during AHCCCSA on-site audit activities.   While  on-
site, the Contractor shall provide the Audit Team with workspace,
access  to  a  telephone,  electrical  outlets  and  privacy  for
conferences.   The Contractor will be furnished  a  copy  of  the
Reinsurance Post-Audit Results letter approximately 60 days after
the  onsite audit and given an opportunity to comment and provide
additional  medical  documentation  on  any  audit  findings.   A
Contractor whose reinsurance case is reduced or denied  shall  be
notified in writing by AHCCCSA and will include the cause for the
reduction  or  denial and describe the applicable  grievance  and
appeal process available.

40.  COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY

By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort.  This means AHCCCSA
shall be used as a source of payment for covered services only
after all other sources of payment have been exhausted.  The two
methods used in the coordination of benefits are cost avoidance
and postpayment recovery.  The Contractor shall use these methods
as described in A.A.C. R9-22-1001.  See Section D, Paragraph 41,
Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.

Cost Avoidance:  The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or
services that are subject to third-party payment and may deny a
service to a member if it knows that a third party (i.e. other
insurer) will provide the service.  However, if a third-party
insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to pay any
copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is
responsible for making these payments, even if the services are
provided outside of the Contractor's network.  The Contractor's
liability for coinsurance and deductibles is limited to what the
Contractor would have paid for the entire service pursuant to a
written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS fee-for-service
rate, less any amount paid by the third party.  (The Contractor
must decide whether it is more cost-effective to provide the
service within its network or pay coinsurance and deductibles for
a service outside its network.  For continuity of care, the
Contractor may also choose to provide the service within its
network.)  If the Contractor refers the member for services to a
third-party insurer (other than Medicare), and the insurer
requires payment in advance of all copayments, coinsurance and
deductibles, the Contractor must make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither
pay for nor provide the covered service, and the service is
medically necessary, the Contractor shall not deny the service
nor require a written denial letter.  If the Contractor does not
know whether a particular service is covered by the third party,
and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service
is covered rather than requiring the member to do so.  (See also
Section D, Paragraph 41, Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.)

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered
services.  For prenatal care and preventive pediatric services,
AHCCCS may require the Contractor to provide such service and
then coordinate payment with the potentially liable third party
("pay and chase").  In emergencies, the Contractor shall provide
the necessary services and then coordinate payment with the third-
party payer.  The Contractor shall also provide medically
necessary transportation so the member can receive third-party
benefits.  Further, if a service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall ensure that its cost avoidance efforts do not
prevent a member from receiving such service and that the member
shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles for
use of the other insurer's providers.

Postpayment Recoveries:  Postpayment recovery is necessary in
cases where the Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage
at the time services were rendered or paid for, or was unable to
cost-avoid. The Contractor shall identify all potentially liable
third parties and pursue reimbursement from them except in the
circumstances below.  The Contractor shall not pursue
reimbursement in the following circumstances unless the case has
been referred to the Contractor by AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's
authorized representative:

Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance  	Restitution Recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance  	Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors, including casualty  			Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above
circumstances to AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the
Contractor identify such a situation.  See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002
and R9-31-1002.  The Contractor shall cooperate with AHCCCSA's
authorized representative in all collection efforts.  In joint
cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and
the Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is
responsible for performing all research, investigation and
payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to the referral of any
and all relevant case information to AHCCCSA's authorized
representative by the Contractor.  AHCCCSA's authorized
representative is also responsible for negotiating and acting in
the best interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable
settlement in joint cases and may compromise a settlement in
order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal and other
costs.  Effective October 1, 2002, the Contractor will
responsible for their prorated share of the contingency fee.  The
Contractor's share of the contingency fee will be deducted from
the settlement proceeds prior to AHCCCSA remitting the settlement
to the Contractor.  For total plan cases involving only payments
from the Contractor, the Contractor is responsible for performing
all research, investigation, the filing of liens and payment of
lien filing fees and other related costs. The Contractor shall
use the cover sheet as prescribed by AHCCCS when filing liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party
collections if all of the following conditions exist:

a.   Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of
     the Contractor's financial liability for the member
b.   There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-
     service, reinsurance or administrative costs (i.e. lien filing
     and contingency fees, etc.)
c.   Such recovery is not prohibited by State or Federal law

Reporting:  The Contractor may be required to report case level
detail of third-party collections and cost avoidance, including
number of referrals on total plan cases.  In addition, upon
AHCCCSA's request, the Contractor shall provide an electronic
extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed cases.
Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member's first
and last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount;
paid/recovered amount; and case status.  The AHCCCSA TPL Section
shall provide the format and reporting schedule for this
information to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working days of
the identification of a third-party liability case with
reinsurance.  Failure to report reinsurance cases may result in
one of the remedies specified in Paragraph 60 (Sanctions) of
Section D.  The Contractor shall communicate any known change in
health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10
days from the date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party
Coverage Form found in the Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule,
with a complete file of all third-party coverage information
(other than Medicare) for the purpose of updating the
Contractor's files.  The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA of any
known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format
prescribed by AHCCCSA.

Title XXI (KidsCare) and HIFA Parents:  Eligibility for KidsCare
and HIFA parents benefits require that the applicant/member not
be enrolled with or entitled to any other health insurance
benefits.  If the Contractor becomes aware of any such potential
coverage, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately.  The
Contractor shall follow the same cost avoidance and postpayment
recovery practices for the KidsCare and HIFA parents population
as it does for the Title XIX and HIFA parents population, and
shall maintain a reporting system which allows Title XIX and
Title XXI information to be reported separately.

Contract Termination:  Upon termination of this contract, the
Contractor will complete the existing third party liability cases
or make any necessary arrangements to transfer the cases to
AHCCCSA's authorized  TPL representative.

41.  MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING

AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid
and Medicare.  These members are referred to as "dual eligible".
Generally, Contractors are responsible for payment of Medicare
coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered services provided to
dual eligible members.  However, there are different cost sharing
responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a
variety of factors.  The Contractor is responsible for adhering
to the cost sharing responsibilities presented in the AHCCCS
Medicare Cost Sharing policy.  Effective 10/1/97, the Contractor
shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare payment
exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same service
of a non-Medicare member.

42.  COPAYMENTS

The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments
from members in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-711 and R9-31-
711. The Contractor may not collect copayments for the following
services:

  a.   Prenatal care including all obstetrical visits;
  b.   Well-baby and EPSDT care;
  c.   Care in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities
       for the mentally retarded;
  d.   Visits scheduled by a primary care physician or
       practitioner, and not at the request of a member;
  e.   Drugs and medications;
  f.   Family planning services.

43.  RECORDS RETENTION

The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to
covered services and expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA
and working papers used in the preparation of reports to AHCCCSA.
The Contractor shall comply with all specifications for record
keeping established by AHCCCSA.  All books and records shall be
maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS
Rules and policies.   Records shall include but not be limited to
financial statements, records relating to the quality of care,
medical records, prescription files and other records specified
by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available at its office at all
reasonable times during the term of this contract and the period
set forth in paragraphs a. and b. below any of its records for
inspection, audit or reproduction by any authorized
representative of AHCCCSA, State or Federal government.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for
a period of five years from the date of final payment under this
contract.

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the
records relating to the work terminated shall be preserved and
made available for a period of five years from the date of any
such termination.  Records which relate to grievances, disputes,
litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the
performance of this contract, or costs and expenses of this
contract to which exception has been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be
retained by the Contractor for a period of five years after the
date of final disposition or resolution thereof.

44.  MEDICAL RECORDS

The member's medical record is the property of the provider who
generates the record.  Each member is entitled to one copy of his
or her medical record free of charge.  The Contractor shall have
written policies and procedures to maintain the confidentiality
of all medical records.  AHCCCSA shall be afforded access to all
members' medical records whether electronic or paper within 20
working days of receipt of request.
The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical record
is established when information is received about a member.  If
the PCP has not yet seen the member, such information may be kept
temporarily in an appropriately labeled file, in lieu of actually
establishing a medical record, but must be associated with the
member's medical record as soon as one is established.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for the
maintenance of medical records so that those records are
documented accurately and in a timely manner, are readily
accessible, and permit prompt and systematic retrieval of
information.

The Contractor shall have written standards for documentation on
the medical record for legibility, accuracy and plan of care
which comply with the AMPM.

The Contractor shall have written plans for providing training
and evaluating providers' compliance with the Contractor's
medical records standards.  Medical records shall be maintained
in a detailed and comprehensive manner which conforms to good
professional medical practice, permits effective professional
medical review and medical audit processes, and which facilitates
an adequate system for follow-up treatment.  Medical records must
be legible, signed and dated.

When a member changes PCPs, his or her medical records or copies
of medical records must be forwarded to the new PCP within 10
working days from receipt of the request for transfer of the
medical records.

AHCCCSA is not required to obtain written approval from a member
before requesting the member's medical record from the PCP or any
other agency.  The Contractor may obtain a copy of a member's
medical records without written approval of the member if the
reason for such request is directly related to the administration
of the AHCCCS program.

Information related to fraud and abuse may be released so long as
protected HIV-related information is not disclosed. (A.R.S. 36-
664I)

45.  ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS

The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA,
make any advances to a related party or subcontractor.  The
Contractor shall not, without similar prior approval, make any
distribution, loan or loan guarantee to any entity, including
another fund or line of business within its organization.  All
investments, other than investments in U.S. Government securities
or Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval.
(See the Reporting Guide for Acute Care Contractors for
alternatives to the prior approval of individual investments.)
All requests for prior approval are to be submitted to the Office
of Managed Care.

46.  ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT

The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund
deficit through capital contributions in a form acceptable to
AHCCCSA within 30 days after receipt by AHCCCSA of the final
audited financial statements, or as otherwise requested by
AHCCCSA.  AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in
any or all GSA's as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if
unaudited.

47.  DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENT

The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA
relating to the information requirements of this contract and as
required to support the data elements to be provided AHCCCSA in
the format specified in the AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines
which is available in the Bidder's Library.  The information so
recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance with all
procedures, policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the
term of this contract.  If any of these procedures, policies,
rules, regulations or statutes are hereinafter changed both
parties agree to conform to these changes following appropriate
notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed
submission or payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors),
and/or penalty applied due to any error, omission, deletion, or
erroneous insert caused by Contractor-submitted data.  Any data
that does not meet the standards required by AHCCCSA shall not be
accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies
immediately upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA.  If any unreported
inconsistencies are subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall
be responsible for the necessary adjustments to correct its
records at its own expense.

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of
eligibility and enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic
data exchange.  Upon request by AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall
provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP assignments in a
form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific
security code for use in all data transmissions made in
accordance with contract requirements.  Each data transmission by
the Contractor shall include the Contractor's security code.  The
Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it certifies
that any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best
of the Contractor's knowledge.  The Contractor further agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from
any and all claims or liabilities, including but not limited to
consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings and
reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any
error, omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the
Contractor in the submitted input data.  Neither the State of
Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be responsible for any incorrect or
delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS services providers
(subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission, deletion,
or erroneous input data caused by the Contractor in the
submission of AHCCCS claims.

The publication AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface
Guidelines describes the specific technical and procedural
requirements for interfaces between AHCCCS and the Contractor and
its subcontractors.  The Contractor is responsible for complying
with all technical requirements as stated in this manual as well
as any subsequent changes to the manual.  A copy may be found in
the Bidder's Library.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative
costs paid to the Contractor.  There is no separate payment for
software changes.  A PMMIS systems contact will be assigned after
contract award.  AHCCCSA will work with the health plans as they
evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):  The
Contractor shall comply with the Administrative Simplification
requirements of Subpart F of the HIPAA of 1996 (Public Law 107-
191, 110 Statutes 1936) and all Federal regulations implementing
that Subpart that are applicable to the operations of the
Contractor by the dates required by the implementing Federal
regulations.

48.  ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING

The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to
the success of the AHCCCS program.  AHCCCSA uses encounter data
to pay reinsurance benefits, set fee-for-service and capitation
rates, determine disproportionate share payments to hospitals,
and to determine compliance with performance standards.  The
Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all covered
services for which the Contractor incurred a financial liability,
including services provided during prior period coverage.  This
requirement is a condition of the CMS grant award.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media
and must be submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats.
Formatting and specific requirements for encounter data are
described in the AHCCCS Encounter Reporting User Manual and the
AHCCCS Technical Interface Guidelines, copies of which may be
found in the Bidder's Library.  The Encounter Submission
Requirements are included herein as Attachment I.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and
made available to AHCCCSA upon request.  The Tracking Report's
purpose is to link each claim to an adjudicated or pended
encounter returned to the Contractor.  Further information
regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found
in The Encounter User's Manual.

49.  MONTHLY ROSTER RECONCILIATION

AHCCCSA produces daily roster updates identifying new members and
changes to members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data,
which the Contractor shall use to update its member records.  The
daily roster which is run prior to the monthly roster is referred
to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate code changes
made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments
and disenrollments.

AHCCCSA also produces a daily Manual Payment Roster which
identifies enrollment or disenrollment activity that was not
included on the Daily Roster due to internal edits.  The
Contractor shall use the Manual Payment Roster in addition to the
Daily Roster to update its member records.

The monthly roster is generally produced two days before the end
of every month.  The roster will identify the total active
population for the Contractor as of the first day of the next
month.  This roster contains the information used by AHCCCSA to
produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month.  The
Contractor will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS
monthly roster.  After reconciling the monthly roster
information, the Contractor resumes posting daily roster updates
beginning with the last two days of the month.  The last two
daily rosters are different from the regular daily rosters in
that they pay and/or recoup capitation into the next month.

Refer to the AHCCCS Contracted Health Plan Technical Interface
Guidelines available in the Bidder's Library for additional
information.

50.  TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW

The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/97 through
9/30/98.  In addition, AHCCCSA reserves the sole option to extend
the term of the contract.  Legislation was passed that allows
AHCCCSA the right to extend the contract in excess of five years.
As a result of this legislation, AHCCCSA is exercising its right
to extend the contract to 9/30/03.  The new contract cycle will
be effective 10/01/03.  All contract extensions shall be through
contract amendment.  If, in conjunction with a contract
extension, AHCCCSA elects to increase the capitation rate for any
risk category, such increase will not exceed in aggregate the
inflation rate recognized by the Arizona Legislature.

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one
GSA, each such contract will be considered separately renewable.
AHCCCSA may renew the Contractor's contract in one GSA but not in
another.  In addition, if the Contractor has had significant
problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may result in the
capping of the Contractor's enrollment in another.  Further,
AHCCCSA may require a Contractor to renew all GSA's, or may
terminate remaining GSA's if the Contractor does not agree to
renew all GSA's.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to extend the contract, the
provisions of such extension will be deemed to have been accepted
60 days after the date of mailing by AHCCCSA, even if the
extension amendment has not been signed by the Contractor, unless
within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that
it refuses to sign the extension amendment.  If the Contractor
provides such notification, AHCCCSA will initiate contract
termination proceedings.

Contractor's Notice of Intent Not To Renew:  If the Contractor
chooses not to renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable
for certain costs associated with the transition of its members
to a different health plan.  If the Contractor provides AHCCCSA
written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at least
180 days before its expiration, this liability for transition
costs may be waived by AHCCCSA.

51.  SUBCONTRACTS

The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract
performance whether or not subcontracts are used.  No subcontract
shall operate to terminate the legal responsibility of the
Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by the
subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract.
Subject to such conditions, any function required to be provided
by the Contractor pursuant to this contract may be subcontracted
to a qualified person or organization.  All such subcontracts
must be in writing.  See policy on claims processing by
subcontracted providers in the Bidder's Library.

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to
prior review and approval by AHCCCSA, Contracts and Purchasing,
and shall incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of
this contract.  The following subcontracts shall be submitted to
AHCCCSA Contracting Office for prior approval at least 30 days
prior to the beginning date of the subcontract:

a.   Automated data processing
b.   Third-party administrators
c.   Management Services  (See also Section D, Paragraphs 53 & 54)
d.   Model subcontracts
e.   Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims
     processing by the subcontractor must be submitted to AHCCCSA,
     Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all
subcontracts, which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two
working days of request by AHCCCSA.   A subcontract is voidable
and subject to immediate cancellation by AHCCCSA in the event any
subcontract pertinent to "a" through "e" above is implemented
without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA.  All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of Federal and State
laws, regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete
requirements in its provider agreements.  Specifically, the
Contractor shall not contract with a provider and require that
the provider not provide services for any other AHCCCS
Contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any
provider the Contractor reasonably anticipates will be providing
services on its behalf more than 25 times during the contract
year.  Exceptions to this requirement include the following:

a.   If a provider who provides services more than 25 times
     during the contract year refuses to enter into a written
     agreement with the Contractor, the Contractor shall submit
     documentation of such refusal to AHCCCS Office of Managed Care
     within seven days of its final attempt to gain such agreement.
b.   If a provider performs emergency services such as an
     emergency room physician or an ambulance company, a written
     agreement is not required.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be
approved by AHCCCS Office of Managed Care.
Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the provisions of
Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions.  In addition, each
subcontract must contain the following:

a.   Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or
     other consideration to be received by the subcontractor.
b.   Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.
c.   Identification of the population, to include patient
     capacity, to be covered by the subcontractor.
d.   The amount, duration and scope of medical services to be
     provided, and for which compensation will be paid.
e.   The term of the subcontract including beginning and ending
     dates, methods of extension, termination and re-negotiation.
f.   The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to
     coordination of benefits and determination of third-party
     liability.
g.   A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify
     Medicare and other third-party liability coverage and to seek
     such Medicare or third party liability payment before submitting
     claims to the Contractor.
h.   A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and
     cost record keeping system.
i.   Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with
     quality assurance programs and comply with the utilization
     control and review procedures specified in 42 CFR Part 456, as
     implemented by AHCCCSA.
j.   A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change
     in ownership of a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated
     with the Contractor shall require a contract amendment and prior
     approval of AHCCCSA.
k.   Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered
     population (may also refer to the Provider Manual).
l.   A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully
     responsible for all tax obligations, Worker's Compensation
     Insurance, and all other applicable insurance coverage
     obligations which arise under this subcontract, for itself and
     its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or
     liability for any such taxes or insurance coverage.
m.   A provision that the subcontractor must obtain any necessary
     authorization from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services
     provided to eligible and/or enrolled members.
n.   A provision that the subcontractor must comply with
     encounter reporting and claims submission requirements as
     described in the subcontract.

52.  SPECIALTY CONTRACTS

AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the
Contractor and AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical
services.  AHCCCSA will consider existing Contractor resources in
the development and execution of specialty contracts.  AHCCCSA
may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts.  Specialty
contracts shall take precedence over and supersede existing and
future subcontracts for services that are subject to specialty
contracts.  AHCCCSA may consider waiving this requirement in
particular situations if such action is determined to be in the
best interest of the State; however, in no case shall
reimbursement exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA
specialty contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an
intermediary between the Contractor and specialty Contractors to
enhance the cost effectiveness of service delivery.  AHCCCSA
reserves the right to make direct payments to specialty
Contractors on behalf of the Contractor.  Adjudication of claims
related to such payments provided under specialty contracts shall
remain the responsibility of the Contractor.  AHCCCSA may provide
technical assistance prior to the implementation of any specialty
contracts.

AHCCCSA shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to
the Contractor prior to the implementation of any specialty
contract.

53.  MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS

All proposed management services subcontracts and/or corporate
cost allocation plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA
Contracting Office as described in Section D, Paragraph 51,
Subcontracts.  Cost allocation plans must be submitted with the
proposed management fee agreement.  AHCCCSA reserves the right to
perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged
and/or corporate allocations made.  If the fees or allocations
actually paid out are determined to be unjustified or excessive,
amounts may be subject to repayment to the Contractor, the
Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting, and/or
financial sanctions may be imposed.

54.  MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS

All management services subcontractors that have oversight
responsibilities for the Contractor's program operations (such as
third-party administrators) are required to have an annual
financial audit.  A copy of this audit shall be submitted to
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a
consultant or actuary are less than $50,000, AHCCCSA will waive
the requirement for an audit of that consultant or actuary.

55.  MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS

In order to be considered for contract award, the Offeror must
meet a minimum capitalization requirement for each GSA bid.  The
capitalization requirement for both new and continuing offerors
must be met within 15 days after contract award.

Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

Geographic Service Area	  Capitalization Requirement
GSA #2	Yuma			  $1,400,000
GSA #4	Mohave, La Paz	   1,150,000
GSA #6	Yavapai, Coconino	   1,250,000
GSA #8	Pinal, Gila		   1,450,000
GSA #10	Pima			   1,250,000
GSA #12	Maricopa		   2,500,000
GSA #14	Graham, Greenlee	     350,000
GSA #16	Apache, Navajo	     650,000
GSA #18	Cochise, Santa Cruz  1,450,000

New Offerors:  To be considered for a contract award in a given
GSA or group of GSA's, a new offeror must meet the minimum
capitalization requirements listed above.  The capitalization
requirement is subject to a $5,000,000 ceiling regardless of the
number of GSA's awarded.  This requirement is in addition to the
Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 56 and 57
below and must be met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a
loan subject to repayment. The capitalization requirements may be
applied toward meeting the equity per member requirement (see
Section D, Paragraph 58, Financial Viability Criteria) and is
intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

Continuing Offerors:  Continuing offerors that are bidding a
county or GSA that they are currently servicing must meet the
equity per member standard (see Section D, Paragraph 58,
Financial Viability Criteria) for their current membership.
Continuing offerors that do not meet the equity standard must
fund through capital contribution the necessary amount to meet
this requirement.  Continuing offerors that are bidding a new GSA
must provide the additional capitalization for the new GSA they
are bidding.  (See the table of requirements by GSA above).
Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional
capitalization if they currently meet the equity per member
standard with their existing membership and their excess equity
is sufficient to cover the proposed additional members, or they
have at least $5,000,000 in equity.

56.  PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE

The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of
standard commercial scope issued by a surety company doing
business in this State, an irrevocable letter of credit, or a
cash deposit ("Performance Bond") to AHCCCSA for as long as the
Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000 or more
outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this
contract, whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the
Contractor's obligations to providers, non-contracting providers,
and non-providers; and (2) performance by the Contractor of its
obligations under this contract.  The Performance Bond shall be
in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS
Performance Bond policy available in the Office of Managed Care.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in
addition to any other remedies it may have under this contract,
obtain payment under the Performance Bond or substitute security
for the purposes of the following:

a.   Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting
     providers and nonproviders by reason of a breach of the
     Contractor's obligations under this contract,
b.   Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on
     behalf of the Contractor, and
c.   Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative
     expenses incurred by reason of a breach of the Contractor's
     obligations under this contract, including, but not limited to,
     expenses incurred after termination of this contract for reasons
     other than the convenience of the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu
of the Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash
deposit, the Contractor agrees to execute any and all documents
and perform any and all acts necessary to secure and enforce
AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary
UCC filings pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code.  In
the event such substitute security is agreed to and accepted by
AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that it has granted AHCCCSA
a security interest in such substitute security to secure
performance of its obligations under this contract.  The
Contractor is solely responsible for establishing the credit-
worthiness of all forms of substitute security.  AHCCCSA may,
after written notice to the Contractor, withdraw its permission
for substitute security, in which case the Contractor shall
provide AHCCCSA with a form of security described above.  The
Contractor may not change the amount, duration or scope of the
performance bond without prior written approval from AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or
create other creditors using the bond as security.

57.  AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND

The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 110%
of the total capitation payment expected to be paid in the month
of October 1997, or as determined by AHCCCSA.  The total
capitation amount shall include SOBRA supplemental payments.
This requirement must be satisfied by the Contractor not later
than 15 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the amount
required.  Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment
statistics of the Contractor on a monthly basis.  If there is an
increase in capitation payment that exceeds 10% of the
performance bond amount, AHCCCSA may require an increase in the
amount of the Performance Bond.  The Contractor shall have 15
days following notification by AHCCCSA to increase the amount of
the Performance Bond.  The Performance Bond amount that must be
maintained after the contract term shall be sufficient to cover
all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by AHCCCSA.
The Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond
without prior written approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care.

58.  FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS/PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

AHCCCSA has established the following financial viability
standards/performance guidelines.  On a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA
will review the following ratios with the purpose of monitoring
the financial health of the Contractor.  The two Financial
Viability Standards, the Current Ratio and Equity per Member, are
the standards that best represent the financial solvency of the
Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor must comply with these two
financial viability standards.

AHCCCSA will also monitor the Medical Expense Ratio, the
Administrative Cost Percentage, and the RBUC's Days Outstanding.
These guidelines are analyzed as part of AHCCCSA's due diligence
in financial statement monitoring.  Sanctions will not be imposed
if the Contractor does not meet these performance guidelines.
However, if a critical combination of the Financial Viability
Standards and Performance Guidelines are not met, additional
monitoring, such as monthly reporting, may be required.

FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS:

Current Ratio
	   Current assets* divided by current
         liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
         long-term investments that can be
         converted to cash within 24 hours without
         significant penalty (i.e., greater than 20%).
	   Standard: At least 1.00

         *if current assets includes a receivable
         from a parent company, the parent company
         must have liquid assets that support the
         amount of the inter-company loan.

Equity per Member
	   Equity*, less on-balance sheet performance
         bond, divided by the number of non-SOBRA
         Family Planning Extension Services members
         enrolled at the end of the period.
         Standard: At least $150
         (Failure to meet this standard may result
         in an enrollment cap being imposed in any
         or all contracted GSAs.)

         *for purposes of this measurement, the
         equity to be measured must be supported by
         unencumbered current assets.

PERFORMANCE
GUIDELINES:

Medical Expense Ratio
	   Total medical expenses divided by total
         capitation + Delivery Supplement +
         Hospital Kick Payment +TPL+ Reinsurance +
         HIV/AIDS Supplement
         Standard:  At least 85%

Administrative Cost Percentage
	   Total administrative expenses (excluding
	   income taxes), divided by total capitation
         + Delivery Supplement + Hospital Kick
         Payment + TPL + Reinsurance + HIV/AIDS
         Supplement.
         Standard: No more than 10%

Received But Unpaid claim (Days Outstanding)
	   Received but unpaid claims divided by the
	   average daily medical expenses for the
	   period, net of sub-capitation expense.
   	   Standard:  No more than 30 days

59.  MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP

A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the
Contractor health plan shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA
and a subsequent contract amendment.  The Contractor must submit
a detailed merger, reorganization and/or transition plan to
AHCCCSA Contracting Office for AHCCCSA review.  The purpose of
the plan review is to ensure uninterrupted services to members,
evaluate the new entity's ability to support the provider
network, ensure that services to members are not diminished and
that major components of the organization and AHCCCS programs are
not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or change
in ownership.

60.  SANCTIONS

AHCCCSA may impose sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or
terminate this contract or any related subcontracts in accordance
with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-406 and the terms of this contract and
applicable Federal or State law and regulations. Written notice
will be provided to the Contractor specifying the sanction to be
imposed, the grounds for such sanction and either the length of
suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be withheld.
The Contractor may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-804.

In lieu of the above remedies, AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose
partial or full enrollment caps on the Contractor.  Among the
contract violations that may result in an enrollment cap are, but
are not limited to, the following:

a.   Marketing violations
b.   Failure to meet AHCCCS Financial Viability Standards
c.   Material deficiency in the Contractor's provider network
d.   Quality of care and quality management issues
e.   Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards

Cure Notice Process :  Prior to the imposition of a sanction for
non-compliance, AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the
Contractor regarding the details of the non-compliance.  The cure
notice will specify the period of time during which the
Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance with
contract requirements.  If, at the end of the specified time
period, the Contractor has complied with the cure notice
requirements, AHCCCSA will take no further action.  If, however,
the Contractor has not complied with the cure notice
requirements, AHCCCSA will proceed with the imposition of
sanctions.

61.  AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not exercise their right to choose and don't have
family continuity, are assigned to Contractors through an auto-
assignment algorithm.  The algorithm is a mathematical formula
used to distribute members to the various Contractors in a manner
that is predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals.  The
algorithm favors those Contractors with lower capitation rates.
For further details on the AHCCCS Auto-Assignment Algorithm,
refer to Attachment G.  AHCCCSA may change the algorithm at any
time during the term of the contract and frequently does so in
response to Contractor-specific issues of non-compliance (e.g.
imposition of an enrollment cap).  The Contractor should consider
this in preparing its response to this RFP.  AHCCCSA is not
obligated to adjust for any financial impacts this may have on
the Contractor.

62.  GRIEVANCE AND REQUEST FOR HEARING PROCESS AND STANDARDS

The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance and
request for hearing process for members and providers which
defines and explains their rights regarding any adverse action by
the Contractor.  The Contractor shall provide the appropriate
personnel to establish, implement and maintain the necessary
functions related to grievances, requests for hearing, and
denials and reductions of services.  Refer to Attachment H for
Grievance and Request for Hearing Process and Standards and
Paragraph 5, Denials and Reductions of Services.

The grievance and request for hearing process shall be in
accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, AHCCCS rules
and policies, including, but not limited to R9-22-Article 8, R9-
31-Article 8 and the Members Rights and Responsibilities Policy.
The Contractor must ensure that the Contractor's grievance and
request for hearing policies include processing procedures and
documentation requirements.  The Contractor must ensure that it
provides written information to both members and providers which
clearly explains the grievance and request for hearing process.

The Contractor shall be responsible to provide the necessary
professional, paraprofessional, and clerical services for the
representation of the Contractor in all issues relating to
grievances, denials and reductions of services and any other
matters arising under this contract which rise to the level of
administrative hearing or a judicial proceeding.

63.  QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT

The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to
AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly
Grievance Report Format.  The Quarterly Grievance Report must be
received by the AHCCCSA, Office of Legal Assistance, no later
than 45 days from the end of the quarter.

64.  KIDSCARE

On November 1, 1998, AHCCCSA implemented a Title XXI Children's
Health Insurance Program, referred to as "KidsCare".  KidsCare
provides health care coverage statewide to eligible children
under age 19 and is provided through the existing AHCCCS health
plans, state employee HMOs that elect to participate at the
beginning of a contract cycle, and tribal facilities or Indian
Health Service for Native Americans who elect to receive services
through them.  Behavior health services for KidsCare members are
provided through the ADHS/RBHA system.

The KidsCare service package is established by the legislature
and approved by CMS through the State Plan. Capitation rates
payable to the Contractor for KidsCare members will be set by
AHCCCSA in conjunction with an independent actuary.

KidsCare members in families with gross household income over
150% and up to 200% of the Federal poverty limit shall pay a
premium to AHCCCSA.  The premium amount shall be based on the
number of children in the family and the gross family income in
accordance with 9 A.A.C., Article 14.

65.  PENDING LEGISLATIVE ISSUES

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 final rules are effective August
13, 2002 and have numerous changes to Medicaid managed care
regulations.  The states will have one year until August 13, 2002
to come into compliance with the regulations.  AHCCCS is
analyzing the impact on our 1115 managed care waiver program.

66.  SEPARATE INCORPORATION

As specified in A.R.S.  36-2906.01, within 60 days of contract
award, a non-governmental Contractor shall have established a
separate corporation for the purposes of this contract, whose
sole activity is the performance of contract function with
AHCCCS.

67.  CULTURAL COMPETENCY

The Contractor shall have a Cultural Competency Plan that meets
the requirements of the AHCCCS Cultural Competency Policy.  An
annual assessment of the effectiveness of the plan, along with
any modifications to the plan, must be submitted to the Office of
Managed Care, Operations Unit, no later than 45 days after the
start of each contract year.  The Contractor must identify a
staff member responsible for the cultural competency plan and
inform the office of Managed Care of that person's identity.

68.  MEDICAID IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS (MIPS)

Pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Department of
Education, and a contract with a Third Party Administrator,
AHCCCS reimburses participating school districts for specifically
identified Medicaid services when provided to Medicaid-eligible
children who are included under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA).  The Medicaid services must be identified
in the member's Individual Education Plan (IEP) as medically
necessary for the child to obtain a public school education.
Services include speech, physical and occupational therapies,
nursing services, attendant care (health aid services provided in
the classroom), transportation to and from school on days when
the child receives an AHCCCS-covered MIPS service, and behavioral
health services.

Services provided through MIPS are specifically intended to allow
children to attend school and do not replace medically necessary
services provided outside the educational setting.  Thus, the
Contractor's determination of whether services are medically
necessary and should be provided to a child shall be made
independently of whether that child also is receiving MIPS
services.  If a request is made for services that also are
covered under the MIPS program for a child enrolled with the
Contractor, the request shall be evaluated on the same basis as
any request for a covered service.

69.  BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN

The Contractor shall develop a Business Continuity Plan to deal
with unexpected events that may affect its ability to adequately
serve members. This plan shall, at a minimum, include planning
and training for:

    Healthcare facility closure/loss of a major provider
    Electronic/telephonic failure at the Contractor's main place of
	business
    Complete loss of use of the main site
    Loss of primary computer system/records

The Business Continuity Plan shall be updated annually. All key
staff shall be trained and familiar with the Plan.

70.  FRAUD AND ABUSE

It  shall  be the responsibility of the Contractor to report  all
cases of suspected fraud and abuse by subcontractors, members  or
employees  in  accordance  with  A.R.S.   36-2918.01  and  AHCCCS
policy.  The Contractor shall provide written notification of all
such incidents to AHCCCSA.  The Contractor shall develop programs
to  detect  and prevent fraud and abuse and shall cooperate  with
AHCCCSA  investigations and audits. Contractors are  required  to
research  potential overpayments identified by a fraud and  abuse
investigation or audit conducted by AHCCCSA.  After conducting  a
cost  benefit analysis to determine if such action is  warranted,
the   Contractor  should  attempt  to  recover  any  overpayments
identified  due to erroneous, false or fraudulent billings.   The
Contractor shall comply with the AHCCCS Health Plans and  Program
Contractors  Policy for Prevention, Detection  and  Reporting  of
Fraud  and Abuse, which is available in the Bidder's Library  and
incorporated   herein   by  reference.   The   Contractor   shall
participate in a fraud and abuse workgroup, which will consist of
representatives   from   acute   care   health   plans,   Program
Contractors,  AHCCCSA,  the Attorney  General's  office  and  the
Center  for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  The purpose  of  the
workgroup is to explore ways to minimize the occurrence of  fraud
and  abuse within the AHCCCS system and to recommend updates  and
revisions to the policy.

The  Contractor  shall develop specific controls to  prevent  and
detect abuse of members.

As  stated  in A.R.S.  13-2310, incorporated herein by reference,
any person who knowingly obtains any benefit by means of false or
fraudulent  pretenses,  representations,  promises  or   material
omissions is guilty of a Class 2 felony.

71.  TICKET TO WORK (FREEDOM TO WORK)

 Legislation was passed to adopt a Federal program that expands
Title XIX eligibility to individuals, 16 through 64 years old who
meet SSI disability criteria, and whose earned income is at or
below 250% FPL.  This program will be implemented early in 2003.

72.  HIFA Parents

In conjunction with the HIFA demonstration initiative, which
attempts to maximize the number of individuals with health
insurance coverage using current-level resources, CMS granted
AHCCCS a HIFA waiver.  The HIFA waiver allows unspent Title XXI
KidsCare funds to be used to cover parents of eligible SOBRA or
KidsCare children not otherwise eligible for Medicaid (HIFA
parents).

HIFA parents will have prospective enrollment only, will pay a
premium ranging from $15 to $35 (except IHS members), and will
not have a guaranteed enrollment period. Due to funding
considerations, this program will have an enrollment cap of
approximately 21,250 members.

The program will be implemented in two phases.  First, HIFA
parents in the Premium Sharing Program (PSP) will be converted
for Title XXI funding effective October 1, 2002.  Contractors
that contract with PSP will continue to be paid capitation by PSP
for the period October 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002.  The
PSP benefits package will continue to be in effect for this time
period.  Contractors will be required to provide financial and
claims information for this population.  Effective January 1,
2003, the PSP conversion population will be eligible for full
AHCCCS benefits, and eligibility will be posted into PIMMIS
retroactively to October 1, 2002.

Phase two will be effective January 1, 2003 when eligible parents
of  SOBRA or KidsCare children will be enrolled with contractors,
subject to an enrollment cap.  Contractors will be paid TANF
rates for HIFA parents after January 1, 2003.  Contracts will be
amended to reflect this change.

term or condition of the contract or failure to take corrective
action as required by AHCCCSA to comply with the terms of the

to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches of
contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received.
The Contracting Officer shall mail written notice of the

specimens to obtain either a CLIA Waiver or CLIA Certificate in
order to obtain reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid
(AHCCCS) programs.  In addition, they must meet all the
requirements of 42 CFR 493, Subpart A.

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical
laboratories to provide verification of CLIA Licensure or
Certificate of Waiver during the provider registration process.
Failure to do so shall result in either a termination of an
active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

Pass-through billing or other similar activities with the intent
of avoiding the above requirements are prohibited.  Prime
contractor may not reimburse providers who do not comply with the
above requirements.

25)  INSURANCE
[This provision applies only if  the Contractor provides services
directly to AHCCCS members]

insurance protection required by this subcontract, or otherwise
obtained by the Contractor, shall not limit the responsibility of
the Contractor to indemnify, keep and save harmless and defend
the State and AHCCCSA, their agents, officers and employees as
provided herein.  Furthermore, the Contractor shall be fully
responsible for all tax obligations, Worker's Compensation
Insurance, and all other applicable insurance coverage, for
itself and its employees, and AHCCCSA shall have no
responsibility or liability for any such taxes or insurance
coverage.

26)  FRAUD AND ABUSE
If the Contractor discovers, or is made aware, that an incident
of potential fraud or abuse has occurred, the Contractor shall
report the incident to the prime contractor, who shall proceed in
accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plans and Program Contractors
Policy for Prevention, Detection and Reporting of Fraud and
Abuse.  Incidents involving potential member eligibility fraud
should be reported to AHCCCSA, Office of Program Integrity,
Member Fraud Unit.  All other incidents of potential fraud should
be reported to AHCCCSA, Office of the Director, Office of Program
Integrity.  (See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-511.)

ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS
(By Geographic Service Area)

INSTRUCTIONS:
Contractors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable
of meeting contract requirements. The information that follows describes
the minimum network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA).
In some GSA's there are required service sites located outside of the
geographical boundary of a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical
access to care. In certain instances. a member must travel a much greater
distance to receive services within their assigned GSA, if the member were
not allowed to receive services in an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which
straddle two different counties.  Enrollment for members residing in these
zip codes is based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip
code has been assigned by AHCCCS. The Contractor shall be responsible
for providing services to members residing in the entire zip code that is
assigned to the GSA for which the Contractor has agreed to provide services.
The split zip cooes GSA assignments are as follows:

86351		Coconino and Yavapai	Coconino		6
86434		Mohave and Yavapai	Yavapai		6

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning and
pediatrics) are not included in the primary care provider contract,
at least one subcontract is required for each of these specialties in
the service sites specified. General surgeons must be available within
50 miles of service sites.

In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Contractor
must demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services
so that members don't need to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard
page specific to GSA # 12.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall have a physician with admitting and
treatment privileges with each hospital in its network. Contractors in
GSA 10 and/or GSA 12 must have at least one hospital contract in each
service district. This requirement is part of the Hospital Subcontracting
and Reimbursement Pilot Program, described more fully in Section D,
Paragraph 35, Hospital Reimbursement. A list of Phoenix and Tucson area
hospitals are included.

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM
Members who have the right to choose but do not exercise this right,
are assigned to contractors through an auto-assignment algorithm.
The algorithm is a mathematical formula used to distribute members to
the various contractors in a manner that is predictable and consistent
with AHCCCSA goals.

The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case
may be a member or a household of members) to contractors using the target
percentages developed. The algorithm data table consists of all the
zip codes in the state, all contractors serving each zip code area, and
the target percentages by rate code within each zip code.

The contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a zip code
and rate code, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case
for that zip code. The equation used is:

	(t/T) - P = d

t = The total members assigned to the zip code per rate code category
    for the contractor
T = The total members assigned to the zip code per rate code category, all
    contractors combined
P = The target percentage of members for the rate code for the contractor
d = The difference

The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference
for each contractor. When more than one contractor has the same difference,
and their differences are greater than all other contractors, the
contractor with the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.

All contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each
rate code, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members
accordingly. A contractor with a more favorable target percentage in the
algorithm will receive proportionally more
members. Conversely, a contractor with a lower target
percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally fewer members.
The algorithm favors contractors with both lower final bids and awarded
rates. The algorithm also favors those contractors with programs that score
higher based on AHCCCSA's evaluation criteria.

Development of the Target Percentages

For the first year of the contract, the algorithm target percentages
will be developed using the methodology described below. However, for
subsequent years, AHCCCS reserves the right to change the algorithm
methodology to assure assignments are made in the best interest of the
AHCCCS program and the state. A contractor's placement in the algorithm
is based upon the following three factors which are weighted equally
(i.e., 33.33%):

1. The final capitation rate bid submitted by the contractor. Final bids
   that are below the bottom of the rate range will be assigned to the
   bottom of the rate range for development of the target percentages.
2. The contractor's final awarded rate from AHCCCSA.
3. The contractor's score on the Program component of the proposal.

Points will be assigned to each contractor by rate code by GSA.
Based on the rankings of the final bids submitted and the final awarded
rates, each contractor will be assigned a number of points for each of
these two components separately as follows:

TABLE FOR FACTORS #1 AND #2

Number of	Lowest 2nd    3rd    4th    5th    6th	7th	 8th
Awards in   Rate   Lowest Lowest Lowest Lowest Lowest Lowest Lowest
GSA		Rate	 Rate	  Rate   Rate   Rate   Rate	Rate   Rate

2	   	60	40
3	   	44	32	  24
4	   	35	28	  22	   15
5	   	30	25	  20	   15	    10
6	   	26	23	  19	   15	    11     6
7	   	25	20	  17	   14	    11     8	5
8	   	25	17	  15	   13	    11     8	6      5

Contractors that have equal bids in a GSA for the same rate code will be
given an equal percentage of the points for all of the positions combined.

The third component of the calculation, program scores, will be assigned
a number of points based on where the contractor ranks among the scores.
The higher the score, the more points assigned.  For this
component, points will be assigned as follows:

TABLE FOR FACTOR #3

f.   Within five working days of receipt, the Complainant is
     informed by letter that the grievance has been received.
g.   All correspondence must be provided in a second language in
     accordance with the Member Information standards set forth in
     Section D, Paragraph 8.  In addition, the Contractor must make
     arrangements to ensure that it complies with "cultural competency
     requirements."
h.   Each grievance and request for hearing is thoroughly
     investigated using the applicable statutory, regulatory,
     contractual and policy provisions, ensuring that facts are
     obtained from all parties.
i.   All documentation received and mailed by the Contractor
     during the grievance and request for hearing process is dated
     upon receipt.
j.   All grievances and requests for hearing are filed in a
     secure designated area and are retained for five years following
     the Contractor's decision, the Administration's decision,
     judicial appeal or close of the grievance, whichever is later.
k.   A copy of the Contractor's decision will be either hand-
     delivered or delivered by certified mail to all parties whose
     interest has been adversely affected by the decision.  The
     decision shall be mailed to all other individuals by regular
     mail.  The date of the decision shall be the date of personal

     alternative resolution process, it must be administered and
     completed within 10 days from receipt of the dispute.  If the
     matter is not resolved to the Complainant's satisfaction within
     the 10-day time period, the dispute must then be adjudicated
     using the grievance and request for hearing standards referenced
     above.  However, the Contractor must render the written decision
     no later than 30 days from the date of the initial filing of the
     grievance or dispute unless a longer period was agreed to by the
     parties involved.
o.   For all disputes where an alternative resolution is
     proposed, the Contractor must maintain a separate log, complying
     with the relevant paragraphs above.

ATTACHMENT I:  ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with
encounter submission requirements.  AHCCCSA may also perform
special reviews of encounter data, such as comparing encounter
reports to the Contractor's claims files.  Any findings of
incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the
imposition of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action
plan.

Pended Encounter Corrections

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days
of the original processing date.  Sanctions will be imposed
according to the following schedule for each encounter pended for
more than 120 days unless the pend is due to AHCCCSA error:

0-120 days    121-180 days   181-240 days   241-360 days   361 + days
No sanction   $5 per month   $10 per month  $15 per month  $20 per month

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter which (1)
AHCCCSA acknowledges to be the result of its own error, and (2)
requires a change to the system programming, an update to the
database reference table, or further research by AHCCCSA.
AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the sanction amount if
circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA, in writing, that the
resolution of a pended encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than
the Contractor, AHCCCSA will respond in writing within 30 days of
receipt of such notification.  The AHCCCSA response will report
the status of each pending encounter problem or issue in
question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA
reviews the Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to
research the issue and provide additional substantiating
documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with the Contractor's
claim of AHCCCSA error.  If a pended encounter being researched
by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error,
the Contractor may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor, in
writing, of the total number of sanctionable encounters pended
more than 120 days.
Pended encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a
means of avoiding sanctions for failure to correct encounters
within 120 days.  The Contractor shall document deleted
encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted CRNs with
appropriate reasons indicated.  The Contractor shall, upon
request, make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

Encounter Validation Studies

Per CMS requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation
studies of the Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction
the Contractor for noncompliance with encounter submission
requirements.  The purpose of encounter validation studies is to
compare recorded utilization information from a medical record or
other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data.  Any
and all covered services may be validated as part of these
studies.  Encounter validation studies will be conducted at least
yearly.

AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and sanction
amounts based on agency review or as a result of consultations
with CMS.  The Contractor will be notified in writing of any
significant change in study methodology.

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies.  Study "A"
examines non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters),
and Study "B" examines institutional services (form UB-92
encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction
amounts and of the selected data needed for encounter validation
studies.  The Contractor will have 90 days to submit the
requested data to AHCCCSA.  In the case of medical records
requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the
records requested within 90 days may result in a sanction of
$1,000 per missing medical record.  If AHCCCSA does not receive a
sufficient number of medical records from the Contractor to
select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor
may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include
timeliness, correctness, and omission of encounters.   These
criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness:   The time elapsed between the date of service and
the date that the encounter is received at AHCCCS.  All
encounters must be received by AHCCCSA no later than 240 days
after the end of the month in which the service was rendered, or
the effective date of enrollment with the Contractor, whichever
is later.  For all encounters for which timeliness is evaluated,
a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of
encounters may be assessed if the encounter record is received by
AHCCCSA more than 240 days after the date determined above.  It
is anticipated that the sanction amount will be $1.00 per error
extrapolated to the population of encounters; however, sanction
amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter
quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements.
The Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in effect
for the studies at the time the studies begin.

Correctness:   A correct encounter contains a complete and
accurate description of AHCCCS covered services provided to a
member.  A sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the
population of encounters may be assessed if the encounter is
incomplete or incorrectly coded.  It is anticipated that the
sanction amount will be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the
population of encounters; however, sanction amounts may be
adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has
changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements.  The Contractor
will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies
at the time the studies begin.

Omission of data:   An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an
encounter inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending
encounter file or historical files in lieu of correction of such
record.  For Study "A" and for Study "B", a sanction per
encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may
be assessed for an omission.  It is anticipated that the sanction
amount will be $5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of
encounters for Study "A" and $10.00 per error extrapolated to the
population of encounters for Study "B"; however, sanction amounts
may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that encounter quality has
changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements.  The Contractor
will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies
at the time the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all
approved and pended encounters to be studied no earlier than 240
days after the end of the month in which the service was
rendered.  Once AHCCCSA has selected the Contractor's encounters
for encounter validation studies, subsequent encounter
submissions for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters,
or may select a sample.  The sample size, or number of encounters
to be reviewed, will be determined using statistical methods in
order to accurately estimate the Contractor's error rates.  Error
rates will be calculated by dividing the number of errors found
by the number of encounters reviewed.  A 95% confidence interval
will be used to account for limitations caused by sampling.  The
confidence interval shows the range within which the true error
rate is estimated to be.  If error rates are based on a sample,
the error rate used for sanction purposes will be the lower limit
of the confidence interval.

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are
provided in the AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical
Document, which is available in the Bidders Library.  This
document also provides examples, which illustrate how AHCCCSA
determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals,
and sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies
will be sent to the Contractor for review and comment.  The
Contractor will have a maximum of 30 days to review results and
provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation that would affect
the final calculation of error rates and sanctions.  AHCCCSA will
examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study
results if warranted.  Written final results of the study will
then be sent to the Contractor and communicated to CMS, and any
sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed
by AHCCCSA not more than 35 days after the Contractor receives
final study results from AHCCCSA.  Challenges will be reviewed by
AHCCCSA and a written decision will be rendered no later than 60
days from the date of receipt of a timely challenge.  Sanctions
shall not apply to encounter errors successfully challenged.  A
challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must be
rendered by AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance and request for
hearing pursuant to Article 8 of AHCCCS Rules.  Sanction amounts
will be deducted from the Contractor's capitation payment.

Encounter Adjustments

Contractors are required to submit adjusted or voided encounters
in the event that claims are subsequently adjusted or denied
after the initial encounter submission.  This includes
adjustments for inaccuracies identified by fraud and abuse audits
or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA or the Contractor.
Contractors shall refer to the Encounter User's Manual for
further instructions regarding adjustments to encounters.
