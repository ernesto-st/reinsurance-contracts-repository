power, right or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Mortgage and the other Credit Documents are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available. In case any provision in or obligation under this Mortgage shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such
provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. Subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement, all covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or

action is taken or condition exists. This Mortgage shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of Mortgagee and Mortgagor and their respective successors and assigns. Mortgagor shall not, without the prior written consent of Mortgagee, assign any
rights, duties or obligations hereunder. Upon payment in full of the Indebtedness and performance in full of the Obligations Mortgagee, at Mortgagor&#146;s expense, shall release the liens and security interests created by this Mortgage and reconvey
the Mortgaged Property to Mortgagor. This Mortgage and the other Credit Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between Mortgagee and Mortgagor and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between such parties relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof. Accordingly, the Credit Documents may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.
