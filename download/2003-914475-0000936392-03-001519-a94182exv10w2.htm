contract, loan or credit agreement, corporate charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, trust agreement or other instrument to which Borrower is a party or

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Binding
Obligations.</U>&nbsp; This Agreement, the Note, the Deed of Trust, the other Loan
Documents, the Guaranty, the Completion Guaranty and the Property Lease (which
Lender shall permit as the only approved lease for the Property) each
constitutes a legal and binding obligation of, and is valid and enforceable
against, each party thereto other than Lender, in accordance with the terms
thereof, except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights or by the effect of general
equitable principles. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Default.</U>&nbsp;
There is no default on the part of Borrower under this Agreement, the Note, the
Deed of Trust, or any of the other Loan Documents or under the Property Lease,
and, to Borrower&#146;s knowledge, no event has occurred and is continuing which
with notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute a default thereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Financial
Statements.</U>&nbsp; All Financial Statements delivered to Lender are true and
correct in all material respects, have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied unless otherwise
noted therein, and fairly present the respective financial conditions of
Borrower and Guarantor and the subjects thereof as of their respective dates. No
materially adverse change has occurred in the financial conditions reflected in
the Financial Statements, and no additional borrowings have been made by
Borrower, other than borrowings approved by Lender, since the Financial
Statements&#146; respective dates, and as otherwise expressly permitted under
the Loan Documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Title to Land.</U>&nbsp;

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.14 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Title to Personal
Property.</U>&nbsp; Other than the collateral under the Security Agreement, all
Personal Property granted as security for the Note under the Deed of Trust is
vested solely in Peony until Borrower acquires title to the Personal Property,
and thereafter in Borrower, free and clear of all claims, liens and
encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances, and the security interest of
Lender in the Personal Property is a first lien thereon. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Plans.</U>&nbsp; Peony or
Borrower has all rights in and to the Plans necessary to use the same for
construction of the Improvements. The Plans are satisfactory to Peony and
Borrower and General Contractor, and have been approved by Peony, Borrower,
Guarantor and the beneficiaries of any applicable Title Restrictions. There are
no structural defects in the Improvements as shown in the Plans, and no
violation of any Governmental Requirement exists with respect thereto, except
any structural defect or violation that would not have a material adverse
effect. </FONT></P>

applicable Governmental Authorities related to the work being performed as of
the Closing Date, (b) filed or recorded all subdivision maps, plats and other
instruments required in connection therewith, and (c) complied with all other
Governmental Requirements related thereto except where the failure to do so

shall obtain all requisite building permits and approvals from all applicable
Governmental Authorities relating to the Plans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.17 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Utilities.</U>&nbsp; All

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.20 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Compliance.</U>&nbsp; The
construction, use and occupancy of the Property comply in full with all
Governmental Requirements and Title Restrictions except where the failure to do
so would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect. Neither
the zoning nor any other right to construct or use the Improvements is to any
extent dependent upon or related to any real property other than the Land. All
approvals, licenses, permits, certifications, filings and other actions normally
accepted as proof of compliance with all Governmental Requirements by prudent
lending institutions that make investments secured by real property in the
general area of the Land, to the extent available as of the date of this
Agreement, have been duly given or taken. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.21 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Prior Liens or

as a condition to issuance of the Title Policy. </FONT></P>

any brokerage commission, finder&#146;s fee, loan commission or other sum in
connection with signing and entering into this Agreement, the consummation of
the transaction contemplated hereby or the making of the Loan by Lender to

such representations and warranties not materially misleading. Any such

or inquiry theretofore or thereafter made by or on behalf of Lender, or any

 Borrower agrees to commence and complete the construction of the Improvements as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the Closing Date, Borrower shall have commenced construction of the Improvements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Borrower shall cause
construction of the Improvements to be prosecuted to Completion within the time
frames in the Construction Schedule, and to be completed on or before the
Completion Date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Construction.</U>&nbsp;
Borrower shall cause the Improvements to be constructed in a good and
workmanlike manner according to the Plans and the recommendations of any soils
or engineering report approved by Lender. In constructing the Improvements,
Borrower shall cause all applicable Governmental Requirements and Title
Restrictions to be complied with. If necessary, the Plans shall be modified to
comply with the Governmental Requirements and Title Restrictions, subject to the
provisions of the following Paragraph 7.3. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Plans.</U>&nbsp; There
shall be no material change, amendment or modification of the Plans, the General
Contract or any subcontract without the prior written approval of Lender, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp; A material change for
purposes of this Paragraph shall include, without limitation, any change that:
(a) involves a cost of more than the Change Order Amount, whether such change
increases or decreases the total cost of the Improvements; (b) together with
costs associated with prior changes, results in an increase in the total cost of
changes of more than the Aggregate Change Order Amount; (c) materially changes
the square footage of the Improvements; (d) constitutes a material change in the
building material, equipment specifications, architectural or structural design,
value or character of any of the Improvements; (e) would affect the structural
integrity, quality or overall efficiency of the Improvements, its operating or
utility systems; (f) requires the approval of any Person other than the parties
to the General Contract or subcontract or Lender; or (g) might adversely affect
the value of Lender&#146;s security for the Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is acknowledged by the parties hereto that the Plans are still being prepared
as of the Closing Date, and that once the Plans for the shell and the tenant
improvements have been completed, the same shall be subject to review and
approval by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, if such
Plans are a logical evolution of and consistent with the Plans as of the date
hereof. </FONT></P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp; Requests for approval
shall be submitted on a Change Order form acceptable to Lender signed by
Borrower and, if required by Lender, the General Contractor, accompanied by
working drawings and a written narrative of the proposed change. Lender shall
not be required to consider approval of any change unless all other approvals
that are required from other Persons have been obtained. As conditions to its
approval, (a) Lender may require satisfactory evidence of the cost and of the
time necessary to complete the proposed change, and (b) to the extent Lender
determines that the proposed change may result in any increased cost, Lender may
make written demand upon Borrower to deliver the amount of the increased costs
to Lender as Borrower&#146;s Funds for deposit into the Borrower&#146;s Funds
Account. Lender is under no duty to review or inform Borrower of the quality or
suitability of the Plans, the General Contract, any other contract or
subcontract or any changes thereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Borrower acknowledges
that the process of obtaining the information needed to put Lender in a position
to approve a proposed change may cause delays. Borrower consents to such delays
and agrees to cooperate diligently with Lender in gathering the information
required by Lender with respect to any such proposed change. All contracts
hereinafter entered into by Borrower, the General Contractor, and other
contractors and subcontractors after the date of this Agreement related to the
Property shall contain covenants to the same effect as the covenants made by
Borrower in this Paragraph 7.3.3. Lender agrees to review, and approve or
disapprove, proposed changes in the Plans and Change Orders on a reasonably
diligent and timely basis. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cost Breakdown.</U>&nbsp;
There shall be no change in the Cost Breakdown without Lender&#146;s prior
written approval, which may be given or withheld at Lender&#146;s sole
discretion. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, there shall be no
re-allocation of amounts between line items without such prior written approval.
Requests for approval shall be submitted on a form acceptable to Lender, signed
by Borrower and accompanied by a written narrative of the proposed change. As
conditions to its approval, (a) Lender may require satisfactory evidence of the
reasons for the proposed change, and (b) to the extent Lender determines that
the proposed change may result in an increase in any cost item, Lender may make
written demand upon Borrower to deliver the amount of the increased cost to
Lender as Borrower&#146;s Funds for deposit into the Borrower&#146;s Funds
Account. On the Closing Date, a portion of the Project Costs set forth in Cost
Breakdown may be attributable to the cost of grading and other site work on
Parcel B (the &#147;<U>Parcel B Site Work</U>&#148;) that is unrelated to the
construction of the Improvements. If Borrower provides Lender with a revised
Cost Breakdown that excludes the costs of the Parcel B Site Work from the amount
of Project Costs set forth on such revised Cost Breakdown, the amount of Project
Costs is not reduced below $67,333,170, and Lender acting in its reasonable
discretion delivers approval of such revisions, then Lender should make
Disbursement to Borrower in an amount equal to the reduction in the amount of
Project Costs that is shown on such Cost Breakdown. </FONT></P>

materials or services, and at all reasonable times to enter the Land and inspect

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; Lender shall have the
right at all reasonable times to enter upon the Land, to inspect the
Improvements and all materials to be used in the construction thereof, and to
examine the Plans and all shop drawings which are or may be kept at the

General Contractor and all other contractors, subcontractors and suppliers of
materials or services to cooperate with Lender toward that end. </FONT></P>

records, accounting data and other documents of Borrower, the General
Contractor, and all other contractors, subcontractors and suppliers of materials

including, without limitation, all permits, licenses, consents and approvals
related thereto; provided, however, Lender shall have such right only to the
extent the General Contractor or the respective subcontractor or supplier is
paid on a time and materials basis. To the extent within Borrower&#146;s
control, such books, records, accounting data and other documents shall be made
available to Lender promptly upon written demand therefor. All contracts
hereinafter entered into by Borrower, the General Contractor, and other
contractors and subcontractors after the date of this Agreement relating to the
construction of the Improvements shall require agreement to the foregoing
inspection rights; provided, however, Lender shall have such right only to the
extent the General Contractor or the respective subcontractor or supplier is

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6.3&nbsp;&nbsp; Without in any way
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Lender may require an inspection of
the Property by any Inspection Agent: (a) prior to each Disbursement; (b) at
least once each month during the course of construction, whether or not any
Disbursement is to be made for that month; (c)&#160;upon Completion of
construction of the Improvements; and (d) at least annually thereafter so long
as any of Borrower&#146;s obligations under this Agreement have not been
satisfied or the Loan or any part thereof remains outstanding, and for any
applicable statute of limitations period thereafter. Borrower shall pay the
Inspection Agent&#146;s standard fee for its inspections, other than inspections
occurring after payment of the Loan in full, reserving to Lender, however, all
rights under the Environmental Indemnity, the Environmental Indemnity-Borrower,
the Guaranty and the Completion Guaranty. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.6.4&nbsp;&nbsp; Lender is under no
duty to supervise or to inspect the work of construction or any books, records,
accounting data or other documents. Lender&#146;s failure to inspect, discover
or disclose any information available to Lender in connection with any such
inspection shall not constitute a waiver of any of Lender&#146;s rights under
this Agreement. Lender&#146;s inspection not followed by notice of an Event of
Default shall not constitute a waiver of any Event of Default then existing. Any
such inspection by Lender shall be for the sole purpose of protecting the
security of Lender, and shall in no way be construed as a representation,
warranty or acknowledgment by Lender that there has been or will be compliance
with the Plans or that the construction is or will be free from faulty materials
or workmanship. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.7 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U> Approved Contracts Only.</U>&nbsp; Borrower shall not sign or enter into any contract or become a party
to any arrangement for the performance of work on the Land except as may be
approved by Lender or with respect to which Lender has waived the requirement
for approval. Unless and until Lender so informs Borrower to the contrary, the
approval requirement shall be deemed waived for any contracts of less than
$500,000 in the aggregate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>No Conditional Sales.</U>&nbsp; Borrower shall not install any personal property, materials,
equipment or fixtures subject to any security agreement or other contract
wherein the right is reserved to any Person to remove or repossess any such
personal property, material, equipment or fixtures, or whereby title to the same
is not completely vested in Borrower at the time of installation, without
Lender&#146;s written consent; provided, however, Borrower shall not be required
to obtain Lender&#146;s consent for the acquisition or the installation of
laboratory equipment on the Property so long as Loan proceeds are not utilized
for said equipment; provided, further, this Section 7.8 shall not apply to
furniture, trade fixtures or equipment that are owned by or leased to Guarantor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.9 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Liens and Stop
Notices.</U>&nbsp; If any claim of lien is recorded which affects the Property (other
than a Permitted Encumbrance) or a stop notice is served upon Lender which
affects the Loan or Borrower&#146;s Funds, Borrower shall, or Borrower shall
cause Peony to, within thirty (30) days after such recording or service: (a) pay
and discharge the same; (b) effect the release thereof by recording or
delivering to Lender a surety bond in form and amount satisfactory to Lender; or</FONT></P>

(c) provide Lender with other assurance which Lender, in its sole discretion,
deems to be satisfactory for the payment of such lien or stop notice and for the
full and continuous protection of Lender from the effect thereof. If Borrower
fails to remove any lien on the Improvements or bonded stop notice against the
Loan or Borrower&#146;s Funds, and fails to provide satisfactory security in
lieu of removal of such lien or stop notice as provided in &#147;(b)&#148; above
and fails to provide Lender with the assurances as provided in &#147;(c)&#148;
above, Lender may pay such lien or stop notice, or may contest the validity
thereof, paying all costs and expenses of contesting the same, including
attorneys&#146; fees, and may debit Borrower&#146;s Funds or the Undisbursed
Loan Account, as applicable, for all payments made and costs and expenses
incurred by Lender in doing so. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.10 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>DeIay.</U>&nbsp; Borrower
shall promptly notify Lender in writing of any event causing material delay or
interruption of the construction or its timely completion. The notice shall
specify the particular work delayed, and the cause and period of each delay. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Surveys.</U>&nbsp; At
Lender&#146;s request, Borrower shall deliver to Lender: (a) a perimeter survey
of the Land; (b) upon completion of the foundations for the Improvements, a
survey showing the location of the Improvements on the Land and showing that the
Improvements are located entirely within the Land and do not encroach upon any
easement or breach or violate any Governmental Requirements or Title
Restrictions; and (c) upon Completion of the Improvements, an
&#147;as-built&#148; survey acceptable to Title Insurer as an ALTA survey. All
such surveys shall be made and certified by a licensed engineer or surveyor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.12 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Correction of
Defects.</U>&nbsp; If in Lender&#146;s opinion any work is not in substantial
conformance with the Plans or is otherwise defective or unsatisfactory to
Lender, Lender shall have the right to stop such non-conforming work and any
other work that may be affected thereby and order its replacement, whether or
not such non-conforming work has theretofore been incorporated into the
Improvements. Failure within thirty (30) days from the date Lender notifies
Borrower of such non-conforming work to diligently endeavor to correct, or cause
the respective contractor to correct, non-conforming work shall constitute an
Event of Default under this Agreement. The advance of any Loan proceeds or
Borrower&#146;s Funds shall not constitute a waiver of Lender&#146;s right to
require compliance with this covenant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.13 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Construction
Responsibilities.</U>&nbsp; Borrower shall be solely responsible for all aspects of
Borrower&#146;s business and conduct in connection with the Property, including,
but not limited to, the quality and suitability of the Plans, their compliance
with all Governmental Requirements and Title Restrictions, the supervision of
the work of construction, the qualifications, financial condition and
performance of all architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors,
suppliers, consultants and property managers, the accuracy of all applications
for payment, and the proper application of all Disbursements. Lender is not
obligated to supervise, inspect or inform Borrower or any third party of any
aspect of the construction of the Improvements or any other matter referred to
above. Any inspection or review by Lender is to determine whether Borrower is
properly discharging its obligations to Lender and may not be relied upon by
Borrower or any third party. Lender owes no duty of care to Borrower or any
third party to protect against, or to inform Borrower or any third party of, any
negligent, faulty, inadequate or defective design or construction of the
Improvements. </FONT></P>

Representation and Warranty.</U>&nbsp; Before signing this Agreement, Borrower
researched and inquired into the previous uses and ownership of the Land. Based
on that due diligence, Borrower represents and warrants that no Hazardous
Substances have been discharged, disposed of or released or otherwise exists in,
on, under or to the Land, except as Borrower has disclosed to Lender in writing
as <U>Exhibit &#147;L</U>&#148; attached hereto and incorporated herein by this

Environmental Laws.</U>&nbsp; Borrower has complied, and shall comply and cause all
occupants of the Land and the Improvements to comply, with all Environmental
Laws which apply or pertain to the Land, the Improvements or the uses thereon or
therein by Borrower or any tenant or other occupant. Borrower acknowledges that
Hazardous Substances may permanently and materially impair the value and use of
real property and that breach of this covenant constitutes willful misconduct
and intentional waste of the Land. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notices to
Lender.</U>&nbsp; Borrower shall give immediate written notice to Lender of: (a) any
proceeding, inquiry, notice or other communication by or from any Governmental
Authority, including, but not limited to, the California State Department of
Health Services and the Environmental Protection Agency, regarding the presence,
release, discharge or existence of any Hazardous Substance on, under or about
the Land or any migration thereof from or to the Property or any actual or
alleged violation of any Environmental Laws; (b) all claims made or threatened
against Borrower or the Property relating to any damage, liability, potential
liability, loss or injury resulting from or pertaining to any Hazardous
Substance Activity or violation of any Environmental Laws; (c) Borrower&#146;s
discovery of any occurrence or condition on any real property adjoining or in
the vicinity of the Land that could cause the Land or the Improvements or any
part thereof to be subject to any restrictions on ownership, occupancy,
transferability or use, or subject the owner or any person having any interest
in the Property to any liability, penalty or disability under any Environmental
Law, including, but not limited to, any that could cause the Land or any part
thereof to be classified as &#147;border-zone property&#148; under the
provisions of California Health &amp; Safety Code &#167;&#167;&#160;25220, et
seq. or any regulation thereunder or in connection therewith; and

as permitted under Paragraph 8.7), or any violation of any Environmental Laws
pertaining to Borrower or the Land. Immediately upon receipt of any of the
following, Borrower shall deliver copies to Lender: any and all orders, notices,
permits, applications, reports and other communications, documents and
instruments pertaining to any Hazardous Substance Activity or the violation of
any Environmental Laws pertaining to Borrower or the Property. Lender shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to join and participate in as a party if it
so elects, any legal proceedings or actions in connection with the Property
involving any Hazardous Substance Activity or any Environmental Laws, and
Borrower shall reimburse Lender upon demand for all of Lender&#146;s costs and
expenses in connection therewith, including attorneys&#146; fees. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Site Visits,
Observations and Testing.</U>&nbsp; Lender and its agents and representatives shall
have the right at any reasonable time to enter and visit the Property for the
purposes of observing the Land, taking and removing soils or groundwater
samples, and conducting tests on any part of the Property. Lender is under no
duty, however, to visit or observe the Land or to conduct tests, and any such
acts by Lender shall be solely for the purpose of protecting Lender&#146;s
security and preserving Lender&#146;s rights under the Loan Documents. No site
visit, observation or testing by Lender shall result in a waiver of any default
of Borrower or impose any liability on Lender. In no event shall any site visit,
observation or testing by Lender be a representation that Hazardous Substances
are or are not present in, on or under the Property, or that there has been or
shall be compliance with any law, regulation or ordinance pertaining to
Hazardous Substances or any other applicable governmental law. Neither Borrower
nor any other party is entitled to rely on any site visit, observation or
testing by Lender. Lender owes no duty of care to protect Borrower or any other
party against, or to inform Borrower or any other party of, any Hazardous
Substances or any other adverse condition affecting the Property. Lender shall
not be obligated to disclose to Borrower or any other party any report or
findings made as the result of, or in connection with, any site visit,
observation or testing by Lender. In each instance, Lender shall give Borrower
reasonable notice before entering the Property. Lender shall make reasonable
efforts to avoid interfering with Borrower&#146;s use of the Property in
exercising any rights provided in this Paragraph 8.5, and shall cooperate as
reasonably requested by Borrower to avoid delay in construction of the
Improvements. To the extent any such delay cannot be avoided, the Completion
Date shall be extended as Lender deems reasonably appropriate in view of all the
circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.6 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Clean-Up.</U>&nbsp;
Borrower agrees, at its sole cost and expense and upon the demand of Lender, to
promptly take all actions to remediate the Property, as validly required by any
federal, state, or local government agency, which remediation is necessitated
from the presence upon or beneath the Property of Hazardous Substances. Such
actions shall include, but not be limited to, the investigation of Hazardous
Substances on, about, or under the Property, the preparation of any feasibility
studies, reports, or remedial plans, and the performance of any cleanup,
remediation, containment, operation, maintenance, monitoring, or restoration
work, whether on or off the Property, relating to said Hazardous Substances.

Ordinary and Reasonable Use of Hazardous Substances Permitted by Law.</U>&nbsp;
Nothing in this Article shall preclude the use by Borrower or General
Contractor, subcontractors, tenants and agents from using materials that may be
classified Hazardous Substances, so long as such use is permitted by applicable
law and is of such types and in such quantities as is ordinary and reasonable in
the construction and operation of the Project. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Deposit of
Borrower&#146;s Funds; Loan Balancing.</U>&nbsp; From time to time, and within ten
(10) days after receipt from Lender of written demand therefor, Borrower shall
deliver Borrower&#146;s Funds to Lender for deposit into the Borrower&#146;s
Funds Account, as and to the extent expressly required by this Agreement. If
Borrower&#146;s Funds shall be located in the Borrower&#146;s Funds Account such
amounts shall be disbursed before the disbursement of any Loan proceeds, except
as may otherwise be agreed by Lender in writing. If at any time in Lender&#146;s
reasonable judgment, the Loan is out of a balance, Lender may make such a demand
upon Borrower and, within such ten (10) day period, Borrower shall deliver to
Lender as Borrower&#146;s Funds an amount equal to the deficiency set forth in
the demand for deposit into the Borrower&#146;s Funds Account. The Loan shall be
deemed &#147;out of balance,&#148; if either: (a) the amount required at that
time to complete and pay for the construction of the Improvements and the other
items contemplated by the Cost Breakdown (excluding the amount of interest
Lender estimates shall accrue on the Loan prior to the Initial Maturity Date) is
more than the Undisbursed Loan (except the Interest Reserve Amount) and the
amounts then on deposit in the Borrower&#146;s Funds Account allocated for such
costs; or (b) the amount of interest Lender estimates to accrue on the Loan from
the time of calculation to the Initial Maturity Date is more than the
undisbursed Interest Reserve Amount. If Lender determines at any time that the
Loan is out of balance, then, in addition to all other rights and remedies of
Lender, Lender may decline to make further Disbursements under the Loan unless
and until Borrower has made the deposit set forth in this Paragraph. </FONT></P>

the Guarantor is subject to the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, the

shall pay and discharge all lawful claims, including taxes, assessments and
governmental charges or levies, imposed upon Borrower, Borrower&#146;s income or
profits and upon all properties belonging to Borrower, before the date upon
which penalties attach thereto; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge or levy, the payment of which
is being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings as provided in the
Deed of Trust. Borrower shall also provide Lender with copies of its Federal tax
returns at the time of filing, if any. </FONT></P>

the information contained therein. From time to time, Lender may receive
financial information about Borrower from others, and may answer consistent with
standard banking practices questions and requests from others seeking credit and

such approval (in Lender&#146;s sole discretion) shall be obtained prior to
Borrower&#146;s signing, entering into or granting the same. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Guarantor or Borrower shall be entitled to enter into a sublease for
up to 10% of the aggregate square footage of the structures on the Property for
an individual sublease, or up to 20% of the aggregate square footage of the
structures on the Property for subleases in the aggregate, on terms consented to

Except for Civil Code Section 3110.5, and subject to the provisions and

Governmental Requirements and Title Restrictions, shall cause all conditions in
this Agreement to be satisfied at the time and in the manner provided in this
