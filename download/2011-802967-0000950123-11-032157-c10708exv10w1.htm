<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;Any Letter of Credit Issuer may resign as a Letter of Credit Issuer upon 60&nbsp;days&#146; prior

of the following sentence, the Company may replace any Letter of Credit Issuer for any reason upon
written notice to the US Administrative Agent and the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and the
Company may add Letter of Credit Issuers at any time upon notice to the US Administrative Agent.
If a Letter of Credit Issuer shall resign or be replaced, or if the Company shall decide to add a
new Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement, then the Company may appoint a successor issuer
of Letters of Credit or a new Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, with the consent of the
US Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), whereupon such successor
issuer shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the replaced or resigning Letter of Credit
Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents, or such new issuer of Letters of Credit
shall be granted the rights, powers and duties of a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, and the term
&#147;US Letter of Credit Issuer&#148; or &#147;Canadian Letter of Credit Issuer&#148; shall mean such successor or
such new issuer of Letters of Credit effective upon such appointment. At the time such resignation
or replacement shall become effective, the Company shall pay to the resigning or replaced Letter of
Credit Issuer all accrued and unpaid fees pursuant to Sections&nbsp;4.1(b) and 4.1(d). The acceptance
of any appointment as a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder whether as a successor issuer or new
issuer of Letters of Credit in accordance with this Agreement, shall be evidenced by an agreement
entered into by such new or successor issuer of Letters of Credit, in a form satisfactory to the
Company and the US Administrative Agent and, from and after the effective date of such agreement,
such new or successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall become a &#147;US Letter of Credit Issuer&#148; or
&#147;Canadian Letter of Credit Issuer&#148; hereunder. After the resignation or replacement of a Letter of
Credit Issuer hereunder, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer shall remain a party
hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit Issuer under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior
to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of
Credit. In connection with any resignation or replacement pursuant to this clause (a) (but, in
case of any such resignation, only to the extent that a successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall
have been appointed), either (i)&nbsp;the Company, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer and
the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall arrange to have any outstanding Letters of Credit
issued by the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer replaced with Letters of Credit issued
by the successor issuer of Letters of Credit or (ii)&nbsp;the Company shall cause the successor issuer
of Letters of Credit, if such successor issuer is reasonably satisfactory to the replaced or
resigning Letter of Credit Issuer, to issue &#147;back-stop&#148; Letters of Credit naming the resigning or
replaced Letter of Credit Issuer as beneficiary for each outstanding Letter of Credit issued by the
resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer, which new Letters of Credit shall have a face amount
equal to the Letters of Credit being back-stopped and the sole requirement for drawing on such new
Letters of Credit shall be a drawing on the corresponding back-stopped Letters of Credit. After
any resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer&#146;s resignation or replacement as Letter of Credit
Issuer, the provisions of this Agreement relating to a Letter of Credit Issuer shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it (A)&nbsp;while it was a Letter of Credit
Issuer under this Agreement or (B)&nbsp;at any time with respect to Letters of Credit issued by such
Letter of Credit Issuer.

Letters of Credit (including, without limitation, any obligations related to the payment of Fees or
the reimbursement or funding of amounts drawn), except that the Company, the resigning or replaced

and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the Company), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the US Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or the
Co-Collateral Agent. The US Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and the
Co-Collateral Agent may deem and treat the Lender specified in the Register with respect to any
amount owing hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment,
negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the US Administrative Agent. The US
Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and the Co-Collateral Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any

Lender or the Company referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a &#147;<U>notice of default</U>&#148;. In the event that the US Administrative

directed by the Required Lenders; <U>provided</U> that unless and until the US Administrative
Agent and the Canadian Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the US

hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of any Borrower, any Guarantor or any other

Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or the Co-Collateral Agent to any Lender.
Each Lender represents to the US Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent and
the Co-Collateral Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the US Administrative
Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of an
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of any Borrower, any Guarantor and any other Credit Party and made its own
decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the US Administrative Agent, the Canadian
Administrative Agent, the Co-Collateral Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,

officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each Lender also acknowledges that the lien and security interest granted
to the US Collateral Agent pursuant to the US Security Documents and the existence of any right or
remedy by the US Collateral Agent thereunder are subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any US
Security Document, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the US Collateral Agent to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement on behalf of
such Lender.

of, withholding tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify the US Administrative Agent or the
