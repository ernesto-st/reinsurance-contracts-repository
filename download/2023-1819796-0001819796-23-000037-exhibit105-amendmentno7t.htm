In no event shall the Borrower be entitled to request any Borrowing that is a Eurodollar Borrowing after  the date hereof (or submit a Notice of Conversion or Continuation with respect to continuing any such  Borrowing as a Eurodollar Borrowing or requesting conversion of a Borrowing into a Eurodollar  Borrowing).

SECTION 7. Amendments; Headings; Severability. This Amendment may not be  amended nor may any provision hereof be waived except pursuant to a writing signed by the Administrative  Agent. The section headings used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this  Amendment and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into consideration in interpreting, this  Amendment. In the event that any one or more provisions of this Amendment should be held to be invalid,  illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the  remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby as to such jurisdiction,  and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in  any other jurisdiction.

If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative  Agent by such Lender and the Administrative Agent has made available the same to the Borrower, the  Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such  Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand  therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately  pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be  entitled to recover from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such corresponding  amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the  Administrative Agent to the Borrower, to the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the  Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if paid by such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective  Rate or (ii) if paid by the Borrower, the then-applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with  Section 2.8, for the respective Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the  Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit  to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its  share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute  such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice  to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the  Administrative Agent. The Swingline Lender shall make available all amounts it is to fund to the Borrower  under any Borrowing of Swingline Loans in immediately available funds to the Borrower by depositing to  an account designated by the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in writing.  (c) Nothing in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its  obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice any rights that the Borrower may have against  any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder (it being understood, however, that no  Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to fulfill its commitments hereunder).  </FONT></DIV>

A certificate submitted to the Borrower  by a Letter of Credit Issuer or a Letter of Credit Participant, as the case may be (a copy of which certificate  shall be sent by such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Letter of Credit Participant to the Administrative Agent),  setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the determination of such additional amount or amounts  necessary to compensate such Letter of Credit Issuer or such Letter of Credit Participant as aforesaid shall  be conclusive and binding on the Borrower absent clearly demonstrable error.  3.6 New or Successor Letter of Credit Issuer. (a) Any Letter of Credit Issuer  may resign as a Letter of Credit Issuer upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the  Revolving Credit Lenders and the Borrower.

If any Letter  of Credit Issuer shall resign or be replaced, or if the Borrower shall decide to add a new Letter of Credit  Issuer under this Agreement, then the Borrower may appoint a successor issuer of Letters of Credit or a  new Letter of Credit Issuer, as the case may be, with the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent  not to be unreasonably withheld), whereupon such successor issuer shall succeed to the rights, powers and  duties of the replaced or resigning Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit  Documents, or such new issuer of Letters of Credit shall be granted the rights, powers and duties of a Letter  of Credit Issuer hereunder, and the term &#8220;Letter of Credit Issuer&#8221; shall mean such successor or such new  issuer of Letters of Credit effective upon such appointment. At the time such resignation or replacement  shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay to the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer all accrued  and unpaid fees pursuant to Sections 4.1(b) and 4.1(c). The acceptance of any appointment as a Letter of  Credit Issuer hereunder, whether as a successor issuer or new issuer of Letters of Credit in accordance with  this Agreement, shall be evidenced by an agreement entered into by such new or successor issuer of Letters  of Credit, in a form satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and, from and after the  effective date of such agreement, such new or successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall become a &#8220;Letter  </FONT></DIV>

After the resignation or replacement of a Letter of Credit Issuer hereunder, the  resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the  rights and obligations of a Letter of Credit Issuer under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents  with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such resignation or replacement, but shall not be  required to issue additional Letters of Credit or amend or renew existing Letters of Credit. In connection  with any resignation or replacement pursuant to this clause (a) (but, in case of any such resignation, only to  the extent that a successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall have been appointed), either (i) the Borrower,  the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer and the successor issuer of Letters of Credit shall arrange  to have any outstanding Letters of Credit issued by the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer replaced  with Letters of Credit issued by the successor issuer of Letters of Credit or (ii) the Borrower shall cause the  successor issuer of Letters of Credit, if such successor issuer is reasonably satisfactory to the replaced or  resigning Letter of Credit Issuer, to issue &#8220;back-stop&#8221; Letters of Credit naming the resigning or replaced  Letter of Credit Issuer as beneficiary for each outstanding Letter of Credit issued by the resigning or  replaced Letter of Credit Issuer, which new Letters of Credit shall have a face amount equal to the Letters  of Credit being back-stopped, and the sole requirement for drawing on such new Letters of Credit shall be  a drawing on the corresponding back-stopped Letters of Credit.

(b) To the extent that there are, at the time of any resignation or replacement as set  forth in clause (a) above, any outstanding Letters of Credit, nothing herein shall be deemed to impact or  impair any rights and obligations of any of the parties hereto with respect to such outstanding Letters of  Credit (including any obligations related to the payment of fees or the reimbursement or funding of amounts  drawn), except that the Borrower, the resigning or replaced Letter of Credit Issuer and the successor issuer  of Letters of Credit shall have the obligations regarding outstanding Letters of Credit described in clause (a)  above.  3.7 Role of Letter of Credit Issuer. Each Revolving Credit Lender and the  Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable Letter of Credit Issuer  shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and  documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy  of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of  the Letter of Credit Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Affiliates or any  correspondent, participant or assignee of any Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any  action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Required Lenders  or the Required Revolving Class Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of  gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability  of any document or instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower hereby  assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any  Letter of Credit; provided that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower&#8217;s  pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any  other agreement. None of the Letter of Credit Issuers, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective  Affiliates or any correspondent, participant or assignee of any Letter of Credit Issuer shall be liable or  responsible for any of the matters described in Section 3.4(c); provided that anything in such clauses to the  contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against any Letter of Credit Issuer, and such  Letter of Credit Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as  opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower caused by such Letter of Credit  Issuer&#8217;s willful misconduct or gross negligence or such Letter of Credit Issuer&#8217;s willful failure to pay under  any Letter of Credit issued by it after the presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and  </FONT></DIV>

In furtherance and  not in limitation of the foregoing, any Letter of Credit Issuer may accept documents that appear on their  face to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information  to the contrary, and no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any  instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights or  benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective  for any reason.  3.8 Cash Collateral.  (a) If, as of the Letter of Credit Maturity Date, there are any Letter of Credit  Obligations, the Borrower shall promptly Cash Collateralize the Letter of Credit Obligations that for any  reason remain outstanding. Section 2.16 and Section 5.2 set forth certain additional requirements to deliver  Cash Collateral hereunder.  (b) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Required Revolving  Class Lenders may require that the Letter of Credit Obligations be Cash Collateralized; provided that, upon  the occurrence of an Event of Default referred to in Section 11.5, the Borrower shall immediately Cash  Collateralize the Letters of Credit then outstanding and no notice or request by or consent from the Required  Revolving Class Lenders shall be required.  (c) For purposes of this Agreement, &#8220;Cash Collateralize&#8221; means to pledge and deposit  with or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuers as collateral for  the Letter of Credit Obligations, cash or deposit account balances (&#8220;Cash Collateral&#8221;) in an amount equal  to 100% of the amount of the Letter of Credit Obligations required to be Cash Collateralized pursuant to  documentation in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the  applicable Letter of Credit Issuer (which documents are hereby consented to by the Revolving Credit  Lenders). Derivatives of such terms have corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the  Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Letter of Credit Issuers and the Letter of Credit Participants a  security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.  Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, interest bearing deposit accounts with the Administrative  Agent. If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are subject  to any right or claim of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or that the total amount of such  funds is less than the Letter of Credit Obligations, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the  Administrative Agent, pay to the Administrative Agent, as additional funds to be deposited as Cash  Collateral, an amount equal to (x) such aggregate outstanding amount minus (y) the total amount of funds,  if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Administrative Agent determines to be free and clear of any  such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash  Collateral, such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under Applicable Laws, to reimburse the  applicable Letter of Credit Issuer. To the extent the amount of any Cash Collateral exceeds the aggregate  outstanding amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and  is continuing, the excess shall be refunded to the Borrower.  3.9 Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the  terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control.  3.10 Letters of Credit Issued for Restricted Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that  a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account  of, a Restricted Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the applicable Letter of Credit  Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit.

Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the  applicable Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued, (i) the rules of the ISP  shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial  Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Letter of Credit Issuer shall be responsible to the  Borrower for, and no Letter of Credit Issuer&#8217;s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall be impaired  by, any action or inaction of such Letter of Credit Issuer required or permitted under any Applicable Law,  order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement,  including the Applicable Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such Letter of Credit Issuer or the  beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions,  practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for  Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of  International Banking Law &amp; Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit is stated to be subject to such  law or practice.

Each such Lender shall, whenever a lapse in time or  change in circumstances renders such documentation obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any material respect,  deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation  (including any new documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or  promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to do so. Unless the Borrower  or the Administrative Agent has received forms or other documents satisfactory to it indicating that  payments under any Credit Document to or for a Lender are not subject to withholding Tax or are subject  to such Tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as  applicable) may withhold amounts required to be withheld by Applicable Law from such payments at the  applicable statutory rate. Notwithstanding anything forgoing to the contrary, the completion, execution and  submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.4(d)(i),  Section 5.4(e) and Section 5.4(g) below) shall not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment such  completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or  expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Without limiting  the foregoing to the extent permitted by law, each Lender that is not a United States person within the  meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a &#8220;Non-U.S. Lender&#8221;) shall:  (i) deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before the date  on which it becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request  of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) two originals of either (w) in the case of Non-U.S.  Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding Tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of  the Code with respect to payments of &#8220;portfolio interest&#8221;, United States Internal Revenue Service  </FONT></DIV>

It is understood and agreed that  the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; herein or in any other Credit Documents (or any other similar term) with  reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)  obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of  market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting  parties.  (b) The Administrative Agent shall also act as the &#8220;Collateral Agent&#8221; under the Credit  Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Hedge Bank and a potential  Cash Management Bank) and the Letter of Credit Issuers hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the  Administrative Agent to act as the agent of such Lender and such Letter of Credit Issuer for purposes of  acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral granted under the Security Documents to  secure any of the Obligations, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.  In this connection, the Administrative Agent, as &#8220;Collateral Agent&#8221;, and any co-agents, sub-agents and  attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 12.2 for purposes of holding  or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or  for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be  entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this Section 12 and Section 13 (including Section 13.5(a), as  though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the &#8220;Collateral Agent&#8221; under the Credit  Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.   12.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent  may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Credit  Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent or the  Collateral Agent, as applicable. The Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent  may perform any and all of its duties and exercise their respective rights and powers by or through their  respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Section 12 shall apply to any such sub-agent  and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and any such sub-agent, and  shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided  for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable. The  Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except  to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that  the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub- agents.  12.3 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent and the Collateral  Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Credit  Documents and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature.

To the extent permitted by  law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.8(b) as though it were a Lender;  provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 13.8(a) as though it were a Lender.

For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent that any plan under the Bankruptcy Code proposes to treat  the Obligations held by any such Non-Debt Fund Affiliate in a manner that is less favorable to such Non- Debt Fund Affiliate in any material respect than the proposed treatment of similar Obligations held by other  Lenders, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized and empowered (in the name of such  Non-Debt Fund Affiliate) to vote on behalf of such Non-Debt Fund Affiliate or consent on behalf of such  Non-Debt Fund Affiliate in any such proceedings with respect to any and all claims of such Non-Debt Fund  Affiliate relating to the Obligations.

To the extent that the  Credit Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedging Agreements or any other  agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221; and each such QFC a  &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of  the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated  thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit  Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Credit Documents and any  Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the  United States or any other state of the United States), in the event a Covered Entity that is party to a  Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution  Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest  and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property  securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to  the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the  Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property)  were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party  or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution  Regime, Default Rights under the Credit Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or  any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to  no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if  the Supported QFC and the Credit Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of  the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies  of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party  with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
