          (c)   The execution, deliver and effectiveness of  this

     holder of a Note under the Note Agreement or the Notes,  nor
     constitute  a  waiver  of  any  provision  of  any  of   the
     foregoing.

of  the  Company  owed to any holder of a Note,  and  (iii)  each
Purchaser  has  acted  in  good  faith  and  has  conducted   its
relationships  with  the  Company in  a  commercially  reasonable
manner  in  connection  with  the  negotiations,  execution   and
delivery of this Amendment and in all respects in connection with

such claims to the contrary that may exist as of the date of this

counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each signed
by  less  than  all, but together signed by all, of  the  parties
hereto.
