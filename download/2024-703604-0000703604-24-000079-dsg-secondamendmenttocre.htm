The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable  discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates  referenced in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have  no liability to any Borrower, any Lender or any other Person or entity for damages of any kind, including  direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses  (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any  such rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

Any financial ratios required to be maintained by any Loan Party  pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other  component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is  expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is  no nearest number).

(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion,  continuation or prepayment of a Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an  amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing,  Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the Dollar  Equivalent of such amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5 of a unit  being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may  be.

Within the foregoing  limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the U.S. Borrowers may borrow, prepay  and reborrow Swingline Loans.  To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower Representative shall submit a  written notice to the Administrative Agent by email as a PDF document or through any Electronic  System, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Administrative Agent, not later than  noon, Chicago time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan.  Each such notice shall be in a form  approved by the Administrative Agent, shall be irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which  shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan.  The Administrative Agent will  promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower Representative.   The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the U.S. Borrowers, to the extent the  Swingline Lender elects to make such Swingline Loan by means of a credit to the Funding Account(s)  (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as  provided in Section 2.06(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank, and in the case of repayment of another  Loan or fees or expenses as provided by Section 2.18(c), by remittance to the Administrative Agent to be  distributed to the applicable Lenders) by 2:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the requested date of such Swingline  Loan.  (b) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Administrative Agent  require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the  Swingline Loans outstanding.  Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in  which the Revolving Lenders will participate.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative  Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender&#8217;s  Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and  unconditionally agrees, promptly upon receipt of such notice from the Administrative Agent (and in any  event, if such notice is received by 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on a Business Day no later than 4:00 p.m.,  Chicago time on such Business Day and if received after 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, &#8220;on a Business Day&#8221;  shall mean no later than 9:00 a.m. Chicago time on the immediately succeeding Business Day), to pay to  the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage  of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to  acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and  shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a  Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be  made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  Each Revolving Lender shall  comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the  same manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Revolving Loans made by such Lender (and  Section 2.07 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the  Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the  Revolving Lenders.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower Representative of any  participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in  </FONT></DIV>

Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrowers (or other party on behalf of  the Borrowers) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a  sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts  received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the  Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline  Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the  Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is  required to be refunded to the Borrowers for any reason.  The purchase of participations in a Swingline  Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrowers of any default in the payment thereof.  (c) The Swingline Lender may be replaced at any time by written agreement among  the Company, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Swingline Lender and the successor Swingline  Lender.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the  Swingline Lender.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all  unpaid interest accrued for the account of the replaced Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.13(a).   From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Swingline Lender shall have  all the rights and obligations of the replaced Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to  Swingline Loans made thereafter and (y) references herein to the term &#8220;Swingline Lender&#8221; shall be  deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Swingline Lender, or to such successor and all  previous Swingline Lenders, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of the Swingline Lender  hereunder, the replaced Swingline Lender shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the  rights and obligations of a Swingline Lender under this Agreement with respect to Swingline Loans made  by it prior to its replacement, but shall not be required to make additional Swingline Loans.  (d) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Swingline Lender, the  Swingline Lender may resign as Swingline Lender at any time upon thirty days&#8217; prior written notice to the  Administrative Agent, the Company and the Revolving Lenders, in which case, the Swingline Lender  shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.05(c) above.  SECTION 2.06.  Letters of Credit.  (a) General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower  Representative, on behalf of a Borrower, may request the issuance of Letters of Credit denominated in  Agreed Currencies as the applicant thereof for the support of the obligations of any Borrower or any  Restricted Subsidiary thereof, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the  Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period.  In the event of any  inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any  Letter of Credit Agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the contrary, the Issuing Bank shall have no obligation hereunder to issue, and shall not  issue, any Letter of Credit (i) the proceeds of which would be made available to any Person (A) to fund  any activity or business of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any country or territory that, at the time of  such funding, is the subject of any Sanctions or (B) in any manner that would result in a violation of any  Sanctions by any party to this Agreement, (ii) if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental  Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing such  Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law relating to the Issuing Bank or any request or directive  (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the  Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit  generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Bank with respect to such  Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Bank is not  otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Effective Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing  </FONT></DIV>

(b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Extension; Certain Conditions.  To request the  issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the  Borrower Representative shall hand deliver or email as a PDF document (or transmit through any  Electronic System, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing  Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment  or extension, but in any event no less than three Business Days) a notice requesting the issuance of a  Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying  the date of issuance, amendment or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such  Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such  Letter of Credit and whether such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in dollars or Canadian dollars or  another Alternative Currency, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, and such other information  as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  In addition, as a condition  to any such Letter of Credit issuance, the applicable Borrower shall have entered into a continuing  agreement (or other letter of credit agreement) for the issuance of letters of credit and/or shall submit a  letter of credit application, in each case, as required by the Issuing Bank and using such Issuing Bank&#8217;s  standard form (each, a &#8220;Letter of Credit Agreement&#8221;).  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended,  renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment or extension of each Letter of Credit the  Borrowers shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment  or extension (i) the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed $25,000,000, (ii) no  Revolving Lender&#8217;s Revolving Exposure (or the Dollar Equivalent thereof) shall exceed its Revolving  Commitment and (iii) the Dollar Equivalent of the Aggregate Revolving Exposure shall not exceed the  aggregate Revolving Commitments.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained  herein, no Issuing Bank shall be obligated to issue or modify any Letter of Credit if, immediately after  giving effect thereto, the outstanding LC Exposure in respect of all Letters of Credit issued by such  Person and its Affiliates would exceed such Issuing Bank&#8217;s Issuing Bank Sublimit.  Without limiting the  foregoing and without affecting the limitations contained herein, it is understood and agreed that the  Borrower Representative may from time to time request that an Issuing Bank issue Letters of Credit in  excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit in effect at the time of such request, and each Issuing Bank  agrees to consider any such request in good faith.  Any Letter of Credit so issued by an Issuing Bank in  excess of its individual Issuing Bank Sublimit then in effect shall nonetheless constitute a Letter of Credit  for all purposes of this Agreement, and shall not affect the Issuing Bank Sublimit of any other Issuing  Bank, subject to the limitations on the aggregate LC Exposure set forth in clause (i) of this Section  2.06(b).  (c) Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire (or be subject to termination  or non-extension by notice from the Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereof) at or prior to the close of  business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in  the case of any extension of the expiration thereof, including, without limitation, any automatic extension  provision, one year after such extension) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving  Credit Maturity Date (or such later date as may be agreed by the Issuing Bank in its sole discretion;  </FONT></DIV>

The Borrowers agree that if on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date any Letters of Credit remain  outstanding the Borrowers shall then deliver to the Administrative Agent, without notice or demand, cash  collateral (or in Administrative Agent and Issuing Bank&#8217;s sole discretion a backup standby letter of credit  satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank) in an amount equal to 103% of the  aggregate amount of LC Exposure then outstanding in the manner set forth in Section 2.06(j) (which shall  be held by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms herein).  (d) Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter  of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or  the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving  Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such  Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount available to be drawn under  such Letter of Credit.

(e) Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect  of a Letter of Credit, the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the  Administrative Agent an amount in the currency of such LC Disbursement (or, if acceptable to the  Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of  such LC Disbursement calculated using the Exchange Rate on the date such LC Disbursement was made)  not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower Representative receives  notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the day of  receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower Representative receives  such notice, if such notice is received after 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the day of receipt; provided that  (x) if such LC Disbursement is denominated in Dollars or Canadian dollars, the Borrowers may, subject  to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.05 that such  payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan (in the case of any LC  Disbursement denominated in Dollars or to the extent the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank  have agreed to accept reimbursement of the applicable LC Disbursement in Dollars, as the case may be)  or a Canadian Prime Rate Borrowing (in the case of any LC Disbursement denominated in Canadian  dollars), as applicable, in the Dollar Equivalent of the equivalent amount of such LC Disbursement or (y)  if such LC Disbursement is denominated in any other Agreed Currency, the Borrowers may, subject to the  conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be  converted into an Equivalent Amount of an ABR Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars in an  amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the equivalent amount of such Agreed Currency and, in each  case, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers&#8217; obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and  replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan or Canadian Prime Rate  Borrowing, as applicable.

Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the  Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrowers, in the same  manner as provided in Section 2.07 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.07 shall  apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative  Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.   Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrowers pursuant to  this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the  extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing  Bank, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a  Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement  (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans, a Swingline Loan or Canadian Prime Rate Revolving  Loans as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrowers of their  obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.  If any Borrower&#8217;s reimbursement of, or obligation to  reimburse, any amounts in any Alternative Currency would subject the Administrative Agent, the Issuing  Bank or any Lender to any stamp duty, ad valorem charge or similar tax that would not be payable if such  reimbursement were made or required to be made in Dollars, the Borrowers shall, at their option, either  (x) pay the amount of any such tax requested by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the  relevant Lender or (y) reimburse each LC Disbursement made in such Alternative Currency in Dollars, in  an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof, calculated using the applicable Exchange Rates, on the  date such LC Disbursement is made, of such LC Disbursement.  (f) Obligations Absolute.  The Borrowers&#8217; obligation to reimburse LC  Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and  irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and  all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of  Credit, any Letter of Credit Agreement or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein or herein, (ii)  any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid  in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) any payment by the  Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not  comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether  or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal  or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers&#8217; obligations hereunder or (v)  any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative  Currency to any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary or in the relevant currency markets generally.   None of the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders or the Issuing Bank, or any of their respective  Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or  transfer of any Letter of Credit, or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective  of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption,  loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to  any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in  interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond  the control of the Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing  Bank from liability to the Borrowers to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect,  consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrowers to the  extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank&#8217;s  failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of  Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross  negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a  nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have  exercised care in each such determination.

(g) Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall, within the time allowed by  applicable law or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all  documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank  shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower Representative  by telephone (confirmed by email or through any Electronic Systems) of such demand for payment and  whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any  failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to  reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then,  unless the Borrowers shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full or a borrowing has been made for  such reimbursement on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear  interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the  date that the Borrowers reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR  Revolving Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, as applicable, and such interest shall be due and payable  on the date when such reimbursement is due; provided that, if the Borrowers fail to reimburse such LC  Disbursement when due pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.13(d) shall apply.   Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that  interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of  this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such  payment.  (i) Replacement and Resignation of an Issuing Bank.  (i) The Issuing Bank may be  replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent,  the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the  Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall  become effective, the Borrowers shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing  Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the  successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement  with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;Issuing  Bank&#8221; shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor  and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank  hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights  and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then  outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters  of Credit or extend or otherwise amend any existing Letter of Credit.

The  Borrowers also shall deposit cash collateral in accordance with this paragraph as and to the extent  required by Section 2.11(b) or 2.20.  Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as  collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations.

Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall  accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to  reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with  related fees, costs, and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for  the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if  the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC  Exposure representing greater than 50% of the aggregate LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other  Secured Obligations.  If the Borrowers are required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a  result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall  be returned to the Borrowers within three (3) Business Days after all such Events of Default have been  cured or waived as confirmed in writing by the Administrative Agent.  (k) Issuing Bank Reports to the Administrative Agent.  Unless otherwise agreed by  the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank (other than JPMorgan) shall, in addition to its notification  obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section, report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) periodic  activity (for such period or recurrent periods as shall be requested by the Administrative Agent) in respect  of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, including all issuances, extensions, amendments and  renewals, all expirations and cancelations and all disbursements and reimbursements, (ii) reasonably prior  to the time that such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such  issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the stated amount of the Letters of Credit issued,  amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,  renewal or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), (iii) on each Business Day on  which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement,  (iv) on any Business Day on which a Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be  reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC  Disbursement, and (v) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent  shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.  </FONT></DIV>

For all purposes of this Agreement, unless  otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated  amount of such Letter of Credit available to be drawn at such time; provided that with respect to any  Letter of Credit that, by its terms or the terms of any Letter of Credit Agreement related thereto, provides  for one or more automatic increases in the available amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit  shall be deemed to be the maximum amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to all such  increases, whether or not such maximum amount is available to be drawn at such time.  For all purposes  of this Agreement, if on any date of determination a Letter of Credit has expired by its terms but any  amount may still be drawn thereunder by reason of the operation of Article 29(a) of the Uniform Customs  and Practice for Documentary Credits, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 600 (or such  later version thereof as may be in effect at the applicable time) or Rule 3.13 or Rule 3.14 of the  International Standby Practices, International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 590 (or such later  version thereof as may be in effect at the applicable time) or similar terms of the Letter of Credit itself, or  if compliant documents have been presented but not yet honored, such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to  be &#8220;outstanding&#8221; and &#8220;undrawn&#8221; in the amount so remaining available to be paid, and the obligations of  the Borrowers and each Revolving Lender shall remain in full force and effect until the Issuing Bank and  the Revolving Lenders shall have no further obligations to make any payments or disbursements under  any circumstances with respect to any Letter of Credit.  (m) Letters of Credit Issued for Account of Restricted Subsidiaries.  Notwithstanding  that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder supports any obligations of, or is for the account  of, a Restricted Subsidiary, or states that a Restricted Subsidiary is the &#8220;account party,&#8221; &#8220;applicant,&#8221;  &#8220;customer,&#8221; &#8220;instructing party,&#8221; or the like of or for such Letter of Credit, and without derogating from  any rights of the applicable Issuing Bank (whether arising by contract, at law, in equity or otherwise)  against such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit, the Borrowers (i) shall reimburse,  indemnify and compensate the applicable Issuing Bank hereunder for such Letter of Credit (including to  reimburse any and all drawings thereunder) as if such Letter of Credit had been issued solely for the  account of such Borrower and (ii) irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be  available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Restricted Subsidiary in  respect of such Letter of Credit.  Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of such Letters of  Credit for its Restricted Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of such Borrower, and that such Borrower&#8217;s  business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Restricted Subsidiaries.

In  such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the  Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrowers each severally agree to pay to the  Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day  from and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but excluding  the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the  applicable Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking  industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the interest rate applicable  to ABR Revolving Loans, or in the case of Alternative Currencies, in accordance with such market  practice, in each case, as applicable.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then  such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing; provided, that any interest  received from the Borrowers by the Administrative Agent during the period beginning when  Administrative Agent funded the Borrowing until such Lender pays such amount shall be solely for the  account of the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 2.08.  Interest Elections.  (a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type and Agreed Currency specified in  the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Term Benchmark Borrowing, shall have an initial  Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower Representative may  elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a  Term Benchmark Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The  Borrower Representative may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected  Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the  Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a  separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted  or continued.  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower Representative shall  notify the Administrative Agent of such election either in writing (delivered by hand or by email as a PDF  document) by delivering an Interest Election Request signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower  Representative or through any Electronic System, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the  Administrative Agent, by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the  Borrowers were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the  effective date of such election.  Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit any  Borrower to (i) elect an Interest Period for Term Benchmark Loans that does not comply with Section  2.02(d), (ii) convert any Borrowing to a Borrowing of a Type not available under the Class of  Commitments pursuant to which such Borrowing was made, (iii) change the currency of a Borrowing or  (iv) elect Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR (it being understood and agreed that Adjusted Daily Simple  SOFR shall only apply to the extent provided in Sections 2.14(a) and 2.14(f)) or Adjusted Daily Simple  CORRA prior to a Benchmark Transition Event and Benchmark Replacement Date with respect to Term  CORRA.

Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may  effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing  arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such  participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such  participation.  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received, prior to any date on which  any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank  pursuant to the terms hereof or any other Loan Document (including any date that is fixed for prepayment  by notice from the Borrower Representative to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.11(c)),  notice from the Borrower Representative that the Borrowers will not make such payment or prepayment,  the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment on such date in  accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing  Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrowers have not in fact made such  payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to  the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank  with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but  excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the applicable Overnight Rate.

The  Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection  with any such designation or assignment.  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrowers are  required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental  Authority for the account of any Lender) pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting  Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the  Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with  and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights (other than its existing  rights to payments pursuant to Sections 2.15 or 2.17) and obligations under this Agreement and other  Loan Documents to an assignee (other than any Ineligible Institution) that shall assume such obligations  (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) (provided that any Affiliate  Lender assuming any such interests, rights or obligations shall be required to first comply with Section  9.04(f)); provided that (i) the Borrowers shall have received the prior written consent of the  Administrative Agent (and in circumstances where its consent would be required under Section 9.04, the  Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such  Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and  funded participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees  and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding  principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the  case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments  required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such  compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation  if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the  Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.  Each party hereto agrees that (i) an  assignment required pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and  Assumption executed by the Borrower Representative, the Administrative Agent and the assignee (or, to  the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant  to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent and such parties are  participants), and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for  such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound by the terms  thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such  assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as  reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without  recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

(a) Except with respect to the exercise of setoff rights in accordance with Section  9.08 or with respect to a Secured Party&#8217;s right to file a proof of claim in an insolvency proceeding, no  Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral or to enforce any  Guarantee of the Secured Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies  under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Secured  Parties in accordance with the terms thereof.  In its capacity, the Administrative Agent is a  &#8220;representative&#8221; of the Secured Parties within the meaning of the term &#8220;secured party&#8221; as defined in the  UCC.  In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by any Person as collateral security for the  Secured Obligations, the Administrative Agent is hereby authorized, and hereby granted a power of  attorney, to execute and deliver on behalf of the Secured Parties any Loan Documents necessary or  appropriate to grant and perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf  of the Secured Parties.  (b) In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no arrangements in  respect of Banking Services the obligations under which constitute Secured Obligations and no Swap  Agreement the obligations under which constitute Secured Obligations, will create (or be deemed to  create) in favor of any Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection with the management  or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under any Loan Document.  By  accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that is a party to any such arrangement in  respect of Banking Services or Swap Agreement, as applicable, shall be deemed to have appointed the  Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and  agreed to be bound by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set  forth in this paragraph.  (c) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain  or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the  Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Lien thereon or any  certificate prepared by any Loan Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Administrative Agent be  responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any failure to monitor or maintain any  portion of the Collateral.  SECTION 8.08.  Credit Bidding.  The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the  Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the  Secured Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of  the Secured Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner  purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral  (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections  363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan  Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted  by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or  otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law.  In connection with any such credit bid and purchase,  the Secured Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the  Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Secured  Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the  acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount  proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent  interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of the  acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase).

Notwithstanding that the  ratable portion of the Secured Obligations of each Secured Party are deemed assigned to the acquisition  vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and  provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which  will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative  Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the  formulation or submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by  such credit bid.

The Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15,  2.16 and 2.17 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under  Sections 2.17(f) and (g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 2.17(f) shall  be delivered to the participating Lender and the information and documentation required under Section  2.17(g) will be delivered to the Borrower Representative and the Administrative Agent)) to the same  extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this  Section; provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 2.18 and  2.19 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive  any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 with respect to any participation, than its participating  Lender would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater  payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable  participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers&#8217; request and expense, to use  reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.19(b) with  respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the  benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to  Section 2.18(d) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for  this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name  and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant&#8217;s  interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the  </FONT></DIV>

(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any  portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without  limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section  shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or  assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute  any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

Any  assignment or participation in violation of this clause (e)(i) shall not be void, but the other  provisions of this clause (e) shall apply.  (ii) If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified Institution  without the Company&#8217;s prior written consent in violation of clause (i) above, or if any  Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the applicable Trade Date, the Company  may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution  and the Administrative Agent, require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without  recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section  9.04), all of its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more  Persons (other than an Ineligible Institution) at the lesser of (x) the principal amount  thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire such  interests, rights and obligations, in each case, plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all  other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it hereunder.

SECTION 10.03.  No Discharge or Diminishment of Loan Guaranty.  (a) Except as otherwise  provided for herein, the obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are unconditional and absolute  and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, not subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or  termination for any reason (other than the Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations), including:  (i)  any claim of waiver, release, extension, renewal, settlement, surrender, alteration or compromise of any of  the Guaranteed Obligations, by operation of law or otherwise; (ii) any change in the existence, structure  or ownership of any Borrower or any other Obligated Party liable for any of the Guaranteed Obligations;  (iii) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting any Obligated Party  or their assets, or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Obligated Party; or (iv) the  existence of any claim, setoff or other rights which any Loan Guarantor may have at any time against any  Obligated Party, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person, whether in  connection herewith or in any unrelated transactions.  (b) The obligations of each Loan Guarantor hereunder are not subject to any defense  or setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever by reason of the invalidity, illegality or  unenforceability of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise, or any provision of applicable law or  regulation purporting to prohibit payment by any Obligated Party, of the Guaranteed Obligations or any  part thereof.  (c) Further, the obligations of any Loan Guarantor hereunder are not discharged or  impaired or otherwise affected by: (i) the failure of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any  Lender to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any remedy with respect to all or any part of the  Guaranteed Obligations; (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law, any waiver or modification of or  supplement to any provision of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations; (iii) any release,  non-perfection or invalidity of any indirect or direct security for the obligations of any Borrower for all or  any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any obligations of any other Obligated Party liable for any of  the Guaranteed Obligations; (iv) any action or failure to act by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing  Bank or any Lender with respect to any collateral securing any part of the Guaranteed Obligations; or (v)  any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed  Obligations, or any other circumstance, act, omission or delay that might in any manner or to the extent  permitted by applicable law, to any extent vary the risk of such Loan Guarantor or that would otherwise  operate as a discharge of any Loan Guarantor as a matter of law or equity (other than the Payment in Full  of the Guaranteed Obligations).  SECTION 10.04.  Defenses Waived.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each  Loan Guarantor hereby waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any  Loan Guarantor or the unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations from any cause,  or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any Borrower, any Loan Guarantor or any other  Obligated Party, other than the Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations.  Without limiting the  generality of the foregoing, to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Loan Guarantor irrevocably  waives acceptance hereof, presentment, demand, protest and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any  notice not provided for herein, as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any  Person against any Obligated Party or any other Person.  Each Loan Guarantor confirms that it is not a  surety under any state law and shall not raise any such law as a defense to its obligations hereunder.  The  Administrative Agent may, at its election, foreclose on any Collateral held by it by one or more judicial or  nonjudicial sales, accept an assignment of any such Collateral in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise act or  fail to act with respect to any collateral securing all or a part of the Guaranteed Obligations, compromise  </FONT></DIV>

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable  law, each Loan Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election even though that election  may operate, pursuant to applicable law, to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or  subrogation or other right or remedy of any Loan Guarantor against any Obligated Party or any security.  SECTION 10.05.  Rights of Subrogation.  No Loan Guarantor will assert any right, claim or  cause of action, including, without limitation, a claim of subrogation, contribution or indemnification that  it has against any Obligated Party or any collateral, until the Loan Parties and the Loan Guarantors have  fully performed all their obligations to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders.  SECTION 10.06.  Reinstatement; Stay of Acceleration.  If at any time any payment of any  portion of the Guaranteed Obligations (including a payment effected through exercise of a right of setoff)  is rescinded, or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization  of any Borrower or otherwise (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a Secured Party in its  discretion), each Loan Guarantor&#8217;s obligations under this Loan Guaranty with respect to that payment  shall be reinstated at such time as though the payment had not been made and whether or not the  Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders are in possession of this Loan Guaranty.  If  acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed upon the insolvency,  bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under  the terms of any agreement relating to the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the  Loan Guarantors forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.  SECTION 10.07.  Information.  Each Loan Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and  keeping itself informed of the Borrowers&#8217; financial condition and assets, and of all other circumstances  bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of  the risks that each Loan Guarantor assumes and incurs under this Loan Guaranty, and agrees that none of  the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender shall have any duty to advise any Loan  Guarantor of information known to it regarding those circumstances or risks.  SECTION 10.08.  Release of Loan Guarantors.  (a) Any Loan Guarantor (other than any Borrower) shall automatically be released  from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty upon the consummation of any transaction permitted by this  Agreement as a result of which such Loan Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary in accordance  with the terms hereof; provided that, if so required by this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall have  consented to such transaction and the terms of such consent shall not have provided otherwise.  In  connection with any termination or release pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall (and is  hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender to) execute and deliver to any Loan Party, at such Loan  Party&#8217;s expense, all documents that such Loan Party shall reasonably request to evidence such termination  or release.  Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section shall be without recourse to  or warranty by the Administrative Agent.  (b) Further, the Administrative Agent may (and is hereby irrevocably authorized by  each Lender to), upon the request of the Company, release any Loan Guarantor (other than any Borrower)  from its obligations under the Loan Guaranty if such Loan Guarantor is no longer a Material Subsidiary.

SECTION 10.09.  Taxes.  Each payment of the Guaranteed Obligations will be made by each  Loan Guarantor without withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by law.  If any  Loan Guarantor determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to withhold  Taxes, then such Loan Guarantor may so withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of withheld Taxes  to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  If such Taxes are Indemnified  Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that, net of  such withholding (including such withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this  Section), the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives the amount it  would have received had no such withholding been made.  SECTION 10.10.  Maximum Liability.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan  Guaranty, the amount guaranteed by each Loan Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the extent, if any,  required so that its obligations hereunder shall not be subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the  Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable state Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act, Uniform Fraudulent  Conveyance Act, Uniform Voidable Transactions Act or similar statute or common law.  In determining  the limitations, if any, on the amount of any Loan Guarantor&#8217;s obligations hereunder pursuant to the  preceding sentence, it is the intention of the parties hereto that any rights of subrogation, indemnification  or contribution which such Loan Guarantor may have under this Loan Guaranty, any other agreement or  applicable law shall be taken into account.  SECTION 10.11.  Contribution.  (a) To the extent that any Loan Guarantor shall make a payment under this Loan  Guaranty (a &#8220;Guarantor Payment&#8221;) which, taking into account all other Guarantor Payments then  previously or concurrently made by any other Loan Guarantor, exceeds the amount which otherwise  would have been paid by or attributable to such Loan Guarantor if each Loan Guarantor had paid the  aggregate Guaranteed Obligations satisfied by such Guarantor Payment in the same proportion as such  Loan Guarantor&#8217;s &#8220;Allocable Amount&#8221; (as defined below) (as determined immediately prior to such  Guarantor Payment) bore to the aggregate Allocable Amounts of each of the Loan Guarantors as  determined immediately prior to the making of such Guarantor Payment, then, following indefeasible  payment in full in cash of the Guarantor Payment, the Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations and  the termination of this Agreement, such Loan Guarantor shall be entitled to receive contribution and  indemnification payments from, and be reimbursed by, each other Loan Guarantor for the amount of such  excess, pro rata based upon their respective Allocable Amounts in effect immediately prior to such  Guarantor Payment.  (b) As of any date of determination, the &#8220;Allocable Amount&#8221; of any Loan Guarantor  shall be equal to the excess of the fair saleable value of the property of such Loan Guarantor over the total  liabilities of such Loan Guarantor (including the maximum amount reasonably expected to become due in  respect of contingent liabilities, calculated, without duplication, assuming each other Loan Guarantor that  is also liable for such contingent liability pays its ratable share thereof), giving effect to all payments  made by other Loan Guarantors as of such date in a manner to maximize the amount of such  contributions.  (c) This Section 10.11 is intended only to define the relative rights of the Loan  Guarantors, and nothing set forth in this Section 10.11 is intended to or shall impair the obligations of the  Loan Guarantors, jointly and severally (but subject to any limitations set out herein with respect to the  guaranty of the U.S. Secured Obligations and Canadian Secured Obligations, respectively), to pay any  </FONT></DIV>

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge that the rights of contribution and  indemnification hereunder shall constitute assets of the Loan Guarantor or Loan Guarantors to which such  contribution and indemnification is owing.  (e) The rights of the indemnifying Loan Guarantors against other Loan Guarantors  under this Section 10.11 shall be exercisable upon the Payment in Full of the Guaranteed Obligations and  the termination of this Agreement.  SECTION 10.12.  Liability Cumulative.  The liability of each Loan Party as a Loan Guarantor  under this Article X is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of each Loan Party to the  Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan  Documents to which such Loan Party is a party or in respect of any obligations or liabilities of the other  Loan Parties, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or  creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary.  SECTION 10.13.  Keepwell.  Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally  absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be  needed from time to time by each other Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under this Guarantee in  respect of a Swap Obligation (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable  under this Section 10.13 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without  rendering its obligations under this Section 10.13 or otherwise under this Loan Guaranty voidable under  applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).   Except as otherwise provided herein, the obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section  10.13 shall remain in full force and effect until the termination of all Swap Obligations.  Each Qualified  ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 10.13 constitute, and this Section 10.13 shall be deemed to  constitute, a &#8220;keepwell, support, or other agreement&#8221; for the benefit of each other Loan Party for all  purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.  ARTICLE XI    The Borrower Representative.  SECTION 11.01.  Appointment; Nature of Relationship.  The Company is hereby appointed by  each of the Borrowers as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the &#8220;Borrower  Representative&#8221;) hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Borrowers irrevocably  authorizes the Borrower Representative to act as the contractual representative of such Borrower with the  rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents.  The Borrower  Representative agrees to act as such contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in  this Article XI.  Additionally, the Borrowers hereby appoint the Borrower Representative as their agent to  receive all of the proceeds of the Loans in the Funding Account(s), at which time the Borrower  Representative shall promptly disburse such Loans to the appropriate Borrower(s), provided that, in the  case of a Revolving Loan, such amount shall not exceed the Availability.  The Administrative Agent and  the Lenders, and their respective officers, directors, agents or employees, shall not be liable to the  Borrower Representative or any Borrower for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Borrower  Representative or the Borrowers pursuant to this Section 11.01.

The Borrower  Representative shall have no implied duties to the Borrowers, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any  action thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be taken by the  Borrower Representative.  SECTION 11.03.  Employment of Agents.  The Borrower Representative may execute any of its  duties as the Borrower Representative hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through  authorized officers.  SECTION 11.04.  Notices.  Each Borrower shall immediately notify the Borrower Representative  of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder, refer to this Agreement, describe such  Default or Event of Default, and state that such notice is a &#8220;notice of default&#8221;.  In the event that the  Borrower Representative receives such a notice, the Borrower Representative shall give prompt notice  thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.  Any notice provided to the Borrower  Representative hereunder shall constitute notice to each Borrower on the date received by the Borrower  Representative.  SECTION 11.05.  Successor Borrower Representative.  Upon the prior written consent of the  Administrative Agent, the Borrower Representative may resign at any time, such resignation to be  effective upon the appointment of a successor Borrower Representative.  The Administrative Agent shall  give prompt written notice of such resignation to the Lenders.  SECTION 11.06.  Execution of Loan Documents.  The Borrowers hereby empower and authorize  the Borrower Representative, on behalf of the Borrowers, to execute and deliver to the Administrative  Agent and the Lenders the Loan Documents and all related agreements, certificates, documents, or  instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of the Loan Documents, including,  without limitation, the Compliance Certificates.

SECTION 11.07.  Nature and Extent of Each Borrower&#8217;s Liability.  (a) Joint and Several Liability.  Each U.S. Borrower agrees that it is jointly and  severally liable for all Secured Obligations and all agreements of the Borrowers hereunder and under the  Loan Documents.  As such, each U.S. Borrower agrees that it is a guarantor of each other Borrower&#8217;s  obligations and liabilities hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  Each Canadian Borrower  agrees that it is jointly and severally liable only for all Canadian Secured Obligations and all agreements  of the Canadian Borrowers under the Loan Documents and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for any U.S.  Secured Obligations.  As such, each Canadian Borrower agrees that it is a guarantor of each other  Canadian Borrower&#8217;s obligations and liabilities hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  (b) Direct Liability.  Nothing contained in this Section 11.07 shall limit the liability  of any Borrower with respect to Loans made directly or indirectly to that Borrower (including Loans  advanced to any other Borrower and then re-loaned or otherwise transferred to, or for the benefit of, such  Borrower), LC Exposure relating to Letters of Credit issued to support such Borrower&#8217;s business, and all  accrued interest, fees, expenses and other related Obligations with respect thereto, for which such  Borrower shall be primarily liable for all purposes hereunder.  </FONT></DIV>
