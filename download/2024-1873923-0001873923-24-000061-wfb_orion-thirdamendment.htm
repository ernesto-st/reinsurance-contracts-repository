Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable once given and binding on the Borrower.

In such event, if such Revolving Lender does not make available to the Administrative Agent the proceeds of such Revolving Loan, then such Revolving Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent on demand the amount of such Revolving Loan with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such Revolving Loan is made available to the Borrower but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of a payment to be made by such Revolving Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation and (ii) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Revolving Lender shall pay the amount of such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.  If such Revolving Lender pays to the Administrative Agent the amount of such Revolving Loan, the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Revolving Loan included in the borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Revolving Lender that shall have failed to make available the proceeds of a Revolving Loan to be made by such Revolving Lender. </FONT></DIV>

An Issuing Bank shall not at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Bank or any Revolving Lender to exceed any limits imposed by, any Applicable Law or such issuance would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of credit generally.  References herein to &#8220;issue&#8221; and derivations thereof with respect to Letters of Credit shall also include extensions or modifications of any outstanding Letters of Credit, unless the context otherwise requires.  Upon the written request of the Borrower, an Issuing Bank shall deliver to the Borrower a copy of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank within a reasonable time after the date of issuance thereof.  To the extent any term of a Letter of Credit Document (excluding any certificate or other document presented by a beneficiary in connection with a drawing under such Letter of Credit) is inconsistent with a term of any Loan Document, the term of such Loan Document shall control.

The Borrower hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay and reimburse each Issuing Bank for the amount of each demand for payment under each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank at or prior to the date on which payment is to be made by such Issuing Bank to the beneficiary thereunder, without presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the election of the Requisite Lenders while an Event of Default exists (or automatically while an Event of Default under Sections 11.1.(a), 11.1(e) or 11.1.(f) exists), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender and the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, interest at the Post-Default Rate on the outstanding principal amount of any Loan made by such Lender, on all Reimbursement Obligations and on any other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder or under the Notes held by such Lender to or for the account of such Lender (including without limitation, accrued but unpaid interest to the extent permitted under Applicable Law). (b) Payment of Interest. All accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be payable (i) (A) if such Loan is a Base Rate Loan or a Daily Simple SOFR Loan, monthly in arrears on the first day of each month, commencing with the first full calendar month occurring after the Effective Date or (B) if such Loan is a Term SOFR Loan, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at three month intervals following the first day of such Interest Period and (ii) on any date on which the principal balance of such Loan is due and payable in full (whether at maturity, due to acceleration or otherwise).  Interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand.  All determinations by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding on the Lenders and the Borrower for all purposes, absent manifest error. (c) Borrower Information Used to Determine Applicable Interest Rates.  The parties understand that the applicable interest rate for the Obligations and certain fees set forth herein may be determined and/or adjusted from time to time based upon certain financial ratios and/or other information to be provided or certified to the Lenders by the Borrower (the &#8220;Borrower Information&#8221;).

In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent on demand that amount so distributed to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. Section 3.2.  Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (a) each borrowing from the Revolving Lenders under Sections 2.1.(a), 2.4.(e) and 2.5.(e) shall be made from the Revolving Lenders, each payment of the fees under Sections 3.5.(b), the first sentence of 3.5.(c), and 3.5.(e) shall be made for the account of the Revolving Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Revolving Commitments under Section 2.13. shall be applied to the respective Revolving Commitments of the Revolving Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Revolving Commitments; (b) each payment or prepayment of principal of Revolving Loans shall be made for the account of the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Revolving Loans held by them, provided that, subject to Section 3.9., if immediately prior to giving effect to any such payment in respect of any Revolving Loans the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans shall not be held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Revolving Commitments in effect at the time such Revolving Loans were made, then such payment shall be applied to the Revolving Loans in such manner as shall result, as nearly as is practicable, in the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loans being held by the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with such respective Revolving Commitments; (c) each payment of interest on Revolving Loans shall be made for the account of the Revolving Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Revolving Loans </FONT></DIV>

Section 3.3.  Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other Obligations owing to such Lender resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such Obligation greater than the share thereof as provided in Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other Obligations owing to the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with Section 3.2. or Section 11.5., as applicable; provided that: (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower or any other Loan Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in Section 3.9.(e) or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of, or sale of a participation in, any of its Loans or participations in Letters of Credit to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. Section 3.4.  Several Obligations. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender hereunder, and the failure of any Lender to make a Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by it hereunder shall not relieve the obligation of any other Lender to make any Loan or to perform any other obligation to be made or performed by such other Lender. Section 3.5.  Fees. (a) Closing Fee.  On the Effective Date, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and each Lender all fees then due and payable as have been agreed to in writing by the Borrower, the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent in the Fee Letters or otherwise. </FONT></DIV>

No party hereto shall have any obligation whatsoever to initiate any such replacement or to assist in finding an Eligible Assignee.

This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

For the avoidance of doubt, Properties may be added to, or removed from, the Unencumbered Pool by the delivery of an Unencumbered Asset Certificate in accordance with this clause (b). (c) Excluded Unencumbered Pool Properties.  If at any time any Unencumbered Pool Property fails to meet all such criteria for qualification (x) such Unencumbered Pool Property shall automatically cease to be an Unencumbered Pool Property for all purposes hereunder and thereafter be excluded from the Unencumbered Pool until such time as it meets all such criteria and (y) Borrower shall, within five (5) Business Days of such Property ceasing to meet all criteria for qualification as an Unencumbered Pool Property, deliver a notice thereof to Administrative Agent together with an updated Unencumbered Asset Certificate reflecting the updated listing of all of the Unencumbered Pool Properties and a new Compliance Certificate reflecting the revised calculations excluding such Property as an Unencumbered Pool Property. </FONT></DIV>

If at any time after acceleration of the maturity of the Loans and the other Obligations, the Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all payments on account of principal of the Obligations which shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement) and all Events of Default and Defaults (other than nonpayment of principal of and accrued interest on the Obligations due and payable solely by virtue of acceleration) shall become remedied or waived to the satisfaction of the Requisite Lenders, then by written notice to the Borrower, the Requisite Lenders may elect, in the sole discretion of such Requisite Lenders, to rescind and annul the acceleration and its consequences.

In such event, the Borrower shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent, promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the Administrative Agent in such performance or attempted performance to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon at the applicable Post-Default Rate from the date of such expenditure until paid.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever for the performance of any obligation of the Borrower under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Requisite Lenders have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise.  Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Requisite Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.

The Lender acting as Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as a Lender, a Specified Derivatives Provider or a Specified Cash Management Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Specified Derivatives Contract or any Specified Cash Management Agreement, as the case may be, as any other Lender, Specified Derivatives Provider or any Specified Cash Management Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent; and the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; or &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include the Lender acting as Administrative Agent in each case in its individual capacity.  Such Lender and its Affiliates may each accept deposits from, maintain deposits or credit balances for, invest in, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of, serve as financial advisor to, and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Affiliate thereof as if it were any other bank and without any duty to account therefor to the Issuing Banks, the other Lenders, any Specified Derivatives Providers or any Specified Cash Management Banks.  Further, the Administrative Agent and any Affiliate may accept fees and other consideration from the Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement, any Specified Derivatives Contract or any Specified Cash Management Agreement, or otherwise without having to account for the same to the Issuing Banks, the other Lenders, any Specified Derivatives Providers or any Specified Cash Management Banks.  The Issuing Banks and the Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, the Lender acting as Administrative Agent or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower, other Loan Parties, other Subsidiaries and other Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such Person) and acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such information to them.

Section 12.4.  Notice of Events of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing with reasonable specificity such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a &#8220;notice of default.&#8221;  If any Lender (excluding the Lender which is also serving as the Administrative Agent) becomes aware of any Default or Event of Default, it shall promptly send to the Administrative Agent such a &#8220;notice of default&#8221;; provided, a Lender&#8217;s failure to provide such a &#8220;notice of default&#8221; to the Administrative Agent shall not result in any liability of such Lender to any other party to any of the Loan Documents.  Further, if the Administrative Agent receives such a &#8220;notice of default,&#8221; the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. Section 12.5.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including its own counsel or counsel for the Borrower or any other Loan Party), independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.  Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties: (a) makes any warranty or representation to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other Person, or shall be responsible to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any other Person for any statement, warranty or representation made or deemed made by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Person in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (b) shall have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the satisfaction of any conditions precedent under this Agreement or any Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or other Persons, or to inspect the property, books or records of the Borrower or any other Person; (c) shall be responsible to any Lender or any Issuing Bank for the due execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto or any collateral covered thereby or the perfection or priority of any Lien in favor of the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lender Parties in any such collateral; (d) shall have any liability in respect of any recitals, statements, certifications, representations or warranties contained in any of the Loan Documents or any other document, instrument, agreement, certificate or statement delivered in connection therewith; or (e) shall incur any liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telephone, telecopy or electronic mail) believed by it to be genuine and signed, sent or given by the proper party or parties.

Such out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) shall be advanced by the Lenders on the request of the Administrative Agent notwithstanding any claim or assertion that the Administrative Agent is not entitled to indemnification hereunder upon receipt of an undertaking by the Administrative Agent that the Administrative Agent will reimburse the Lenders if it is actually and finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Administrative Agent is not so entitled to indemnification.  The agreements in this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.  If the Borrower shall reimburse the Administrative Agent for any Indemnifiable Amount following payment by any Lender to the Administrative Agent in respect of such Indemnifiable Amount pursuant to this Section, the Administrative Agent shall share such reimbursement on a ratable basis with each Lender making any such payment.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or counsel to the Administrative Agent or any of their respective Related Parties, and based on such review, advice, documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under the Loan Documents.  The Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party of the Loan Documents or any other document referred to or provided for therein or to inspect the properties or books of, or make any other investigation of, the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Subsidiary.

The Administrative Agent (a) may resign at any time as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower or (b) may be removed by the Borrower or the Requisite Lenders at any time that the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Lender, is a Defaulting Lender.  Upon any such resignation or removal, the Requisite Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent which appointment shall, provided no Event of Default exists, be subject to the Borrower&#8217;s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the current Administrative Agent&#8217;s giving of notice of resignation or notice of removal, then the current Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a Lender, if any Lender shall be willing to serve, and otherwise shall be an Eligible Assignee (but in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender); provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no Lender has accepted such appointment, then such resignation or removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made to each Lender and each Issuing Bank directly, until such time as a successor Administrative Agent has been appointed as provided for above in this Section; provided, further that such Lenders and such Issuing Banks so acting directly shall be and be deemed to be protected by all indemnities and other provisions herein for the benefit and protection of the Administrative Agent as if each such Lender or Issuing Bank were itself the Administrative Agent.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the current Administrative Agent, and the current Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents.

Upon the acceptance of a successor&#8217;s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder (i) the Resigning Lender shall be discharged from all duties and obligations of an Issuing Bank hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) the successor Administrative Agent, in its capacity as an Issuing Bank shall issue letters of credit in substitution for all Letters of Credit issued by the Resigning Lender as Issuing Bank outstanding at the time of such succession (which letters of credit issued in substitution shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued hereunder) or make other arrangements satisfactory to the Resigning Lender to effectively assume the obligations of the Resigning Lender with respect to such Letters of Credit.

Section 12.10.  Specified Derivatives Contracts and Specified Cash Management Agreements. No Specified Cash Management Bank or Specified Derivatives Provider that obtains the benefits of Section 11.5. by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Loan Document shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of any Loan Document or the Collateral other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, Specified Cash Management Agreements and Specified Derivatives Contracts unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice of such Specified Cash Management Agreements and Specified Derivatives Contracts, together with such supporting documentation as the Administrative Agent may request, from the applicable Specified Cash Management Bank or Specified Derivatives Provider, as the case may be.

The Administrative Agent shall prepare a recommended course of action for such Collateral (a &#8220;Post-Foreclosure Plan&#8221;), which shall be subject to the approval of the Requisite Lenders.  In accordance with the approved Post-Foreclosure Plan, the Administrative Agent shall manage, operate, repair, administer, complete, construct, restore or otherwise deal with the Collateral acquired, and shall administer all transactions relating thereto, including agents for the sale of such Collateral, and the collecting of rents and other sums from such Collateral and paying the expenses of such Collateral.

In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit in accordance with its Commitment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with the immediately following subsection (d). (c) Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Principal Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#8220;Register&#8221;).

Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.6. with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.3. as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.3. as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant&#8217;s interest in the Commitments, Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (e) Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. </FONT></DIV>

To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, &#8220;QFC Credit Support&#8221; and, each such QFC, a &#8220;Supported QFC&#8221;), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the &#8220;U.S. Special Resolution Regimes&#8221;) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): (a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a &#8220;Covered Party&#8221;) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support. (b) As used in this Section 13.21., the following terms have the following meanings: &#8220;BHC Act Affiliate&#8221; of a party means an &#8220;affiliate&#8221; (as such term is defined under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party. &#8220;Covered Entity&#8221; means any of the following: (i) a &#8220;covered entity&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 252.82(b); (ii) a &#8220;covered bank&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 47.3(b); or (iii) a &#8220;covered FSI&#8221; as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 382.2(b). &#8220;Default Right&#8221; has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. &sect;&sect; 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable. </FONT></DIV>
