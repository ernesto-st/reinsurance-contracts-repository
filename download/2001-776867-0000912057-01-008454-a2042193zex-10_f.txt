                  Changes in the Applicable Margin shall become effective on the
         date on which S&P and/or Moody's changes the rating it has issued for
         the Facilities. In the event of split ratings, the lower rating shall
         apply, PROVIDED that if the ratings are split by two or more levels,
         the rating level next higher than the lower of the two ratings will
         apply. Level 4 applies when there is either a BBB- or a Baa3 rating and

         rating level next lower than the rating issued by the other of such
         rating agencies. In the event that, at any time, the Facilities are
         rated by neither such rating agency, the Applicable Margin shall be as
         for Level 6. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Facilities receive a
         rating of BBB or higher from S&P and a rating of Baa2 or higher from
         Moody's, the Applicable Margins shall be as for Level 3 until the first
         anniversary of the Closing Date.

                  "APPLICATION": an application, in such form as the Issuing
         Lender may specify from time to time, requesting the Issuing Lender to

         proceeds to the Parent, the Primary Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         (valued at the initial principal amount thereof in the case of non-cash
         proceeds consisting of notes or other debt securities and valued at
         fair market value in the case of other non-cash proceeds) in excess of
         $5,000,000. Any Disposition of Property by an Insurance Subsidiary
         shall not constitute an Asset Sale.

         any, of (a) such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect

         PROVIDED, that in calculating any Lender's Revolving Extensions of
         Credit for the purpose of determining such Lender's Available Revolving
         Credit Commitment pursuant to Section 2.9(a), the aggregate principal
         amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding shall be deemed to be zero.

                  "BASE RATE": for any day, a rate of interest per annum
         (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to the

         Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 1/2 of 1%. For purposes
         hereof: "PRIME RATE" shall mean the prime lending rate as set forth on
         the British Banking Association Telerate page 5 (or such other
         comparable page as may, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent,
         replace such page for the purpose of displaying such rate), as in
         effect from time to time. The Prime Rate is a reference rate and does
         not necessarily represent the lowest or best rate actually available.
         The Administrative Agent or any Lender may make commercial loans or
         other loans at rates of interest at, above or below the Prime Rate. Any
         change in the Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the

                  "BASE RATE LOANS": Loans for which the applicable rate of
         interest is based upon the Base Rate.

PROVIDED, that if, having used its best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals
required to permit quarterly payment of dividends by its Insurance Subsidiaries
(the Primary Borrower hereby covenanting to use its best efforts to obtain such
regulatory approvals), the Primary Borrower does not obtain such approvals for
payments prior to June 30, 2002, principal payments in respect of the Tranche B
Term Loans scheduled to be made on June 30, 2002, September 30, 2002, December

         2.4 REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS. (a) Subject to the terms and

revolving credit loans ("REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS") to the Primary Borrower (and,
from and after the Revolving Commitment Increase Date and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 2.25, the Additional Borrower) from time to time
during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount
at any one time outstanding for each Revolving Credit Lender which, when added
to such Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of the sum of (i) the L/C
Obligations then outstanding and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the
Swing Line Loans then outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment. During the Revolving Credit Commitment Period the
Primary Borrower (and, from and after the Revolving Commitment Increase Date and
subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.25, the Additional Borrower)
may use the Revolving Credit Commitments by borrowing, prepaying the Revolving
Credit Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the
terms and conditions hereof. The Revolving Credit Loans may from time to time be
Eurodollar Loans or Base Rate Loans, as determined by the relevant Borrower and
notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.5 and 2.13,
provided that no Revolving Credit Loan shall be made as a Eurodollar Loan after
the day that is one month prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

         (b) Each Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans
made to such Borrower on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.

         2.5 PROCEDURE FOR REVOLVING CREDIT BORROWING. The Primary Borrower
(and, from and after the Revolving Commitment Increase Date and subject to the
conditions set forth in Section 2.25, the Additional Borrower) may borrow under
the Revolving Credit Commitments on any Business Day during the Revolving Credit
Commitment Period, PROVIDED that the relevant Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, (a) three Business
Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, or
(b) one Business Day prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Base

<PAGE>


                                       30


(i) the amount and Type of Revolving Credit Loans to be borrowed, (ii) the
requested Borrowing Date and (iii) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the length
of the initial Interest Period therefor. Each borrowing of Revolving Credit
Loans under the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be in an amount equal to (x)
in the case of Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof (or, if
the then aggregate Available Revolving Credit Commitments are less than
$1,000,000, such lesser amount) and (y) in the case of Eurodollar Loans,
$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; PROVIDED, that
the Swing Line Lender may request, on behalf of the Primary Borrower, borrowings
of Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit Commitments in other amounts
pursuant to Section 2.7. Upon receipt of any such notice from any Borrower, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Lender thereof.
Each Revolving Credit Lender will make its Revolving Credit Percentage of the
amount of each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Borrower at the Funding Office
prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Borrowing Date requested by such
Borrower in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such
borrowing will then be made available to such Borrower by the Administrative
Agent in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

         2.6 SWING LINE COMMITMENT. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swing Line Lender agrees that, during the Revolving Credit
Commitment Period, it will make available to the Primary Borrower in the form of
swing line loans ("SWING LINE LOANS") a portion of the credit otherwise
available to the Primary Borrower under the Revolving Credit Commitments;
PROVIDED that (i) the aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Loans outstanding
at any time shall not exceed the Swing Line Commitment then in effect
(notwithstanding that the Swing Line Loans outstanding at any time, when
aggregated with the Swing Line Lender's other outstanding Revolving Credit Loans
hereunder, may exceed the Swing Line Commitment then in effect or such Swing
Line Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect) and (ii) the Primary
Borrower shall not request, and the Swing Line Lender shall not make, any Swing
Line Loan if, after giving effect to the making of such Swing Line Loan, the
aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments would be less
than zero. During the Revolving Credit Commitment Period, the Primary Borrower
may use the Swing Line Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Swing Line Loans shall be Base
Rate Loans only.

         (b) The Primary Borrower shall repay all outstanding Swing Line Loans
on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Each payment in respect of Swing Line
Loans shall be made to the Swing Line Lender.

         2.7 PROCEDURE FOR SWING LINE BORROWING; REFUNDING OF SWING LINE LOANS.
(a) The Primary Borrower may borrow under the Swing Line Commitment on any
Business Day during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period, PROVIDED, the
Primary Borrower shall give the Swing Line Lender irrevocable telephonic notice
confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received by the
Swing Line Lender not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the proposed
Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested
Borrowing Date. Each borrowing under the Swing Line Commitment shall be in an
amount equal to $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Not
later than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in the
borrowing notice in respect of any Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender shall
make available to the

                                                                              31


Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available
funds equal to the amount of such Swing Line Loan. The Administrative Agent
shall make the proceeds of such Swing Line Loan available to the Primary
Borrower on such Borrowing Date in like funds as received by the Administrative
Agent.

         (b) The Swing Line Lender, at any time and from time to time in its
sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of the Primary Borrower (which
hereby irrevocably directs the Swing Line Lender to act on its behalf), on one
Business Day's notice given by the Swing Line Lender no later than 12:00 Noon,
New York City time, request each Revolving Credit Lender to make, and each
Revolving Credit Lender hereby agrees to make, a Revolving Credit Loan, in an
amount equal to such Revolving Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage of
the aggregate amount of the Swing Line Loans (the "REFUNDED SWING LINE LOANS")
outstanding on the date of such notice, to repay the Swing Line Lender. Each
Revolving Credit Lender shall make the amount of such Revolving Credit Loan
available to the Administrative Agent at the Funding Office in immediately
available funds, not later than 10:00 A.M., New York City time, one Business Day
after the date of such notice. The proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans shall
be made immediately available by the Administrative Agent to the Swing Line
Lender for application by the Swing Line Lender to the repayment of the Refunded
Swing Line Loans. Upon the written request of any Revolving Credit Lender, the
Administrative Agent will, within three Business Days of such request, inform
such Revolving Credit Lender of the aggregate amount of Swing Line Loans
outstanding on the date of such request.

         (c) If prior to the time a Revolving Credit Loan would have otherwise
been made pursuant to Section 2.7(b), one of the events described in Section
8(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Primary Borrower,
or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swing Line Lender in its sole
discretion, Revolving Credit Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section
2.7(b), each Revolving Credit Lender shall, on the date such Revolving Credit
Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 2.7(b)
(the "REFUNDING DATE"), purchase for cash an undivided participating interest in
the then outstanding Swing Line Loans by paying to the Swing Line Lender an
amount (the "SWING LINE PARTICIPATION AMOUNT") equal to (i) such Revolving
Credit Lender's Revolving Credit Percentage TIMES (ii) the sum of the aggregate
principal amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding which were to have been
repaid with such Revolving Credit Loans.

         (d) Whenever, at any time after the Swing Line Lender has received from
any Revolving Credit Lender such Lender's Swing Line Participation Amount, the
Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of the Swing Line Loans, the
Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swing Line Participation
Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding
and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such
Lender's PRO RATA portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to
pay the principal of and interest on all Swing Line Loans then due); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that in the event that such payment received by the Swing Line Lender
is required to be returned, such Revolving Credit Lender will return to the
Swing Line Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the Swing
Line Lender.

         (e) Each Revolving Credit Lender's obligation to make the Loans
referred to in Section 2.7(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant
to Section 2.7(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance, including, without limitation, (i) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving Credit
Lender or the Primary Borrower may have against the Swing Line Lender, the
Primary Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the
occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or the failure to
satisfy any of the other conditions specified in Section 5; (iii) any adverse
change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Primary Borrower; (iv)
any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by the Primary Borrower,
any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Credit Lender; or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

         2.8 REPAYMENT OF LOANS; EVIDENCE OF DEBT. (a) Each Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the appropriate Revolving Credit Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Credit Loan of such Revolving Credit Lender made to such Borrower on
the Revolving Credit Termination Date (or on such earlier date on which the
Loans become due and payable pursuant to Section 8). The Primary Borrower hereby
unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the appropriate Revolving Credit Lender or Term Loan Lender, as the case may be,
(i) the then unpaid principal amount of each Swing Line Loan of such Swing Line
Lender on the Revolving Credit Termination Date (or on such earlier date on
which the Loans become due and payable pursuant to Section 8) and (iii) the
principal amount of each Term Loan of such Term Loan Lender in installments
according to the amortization schedule set forth in Section 2.3 (or on such
earlier date on which the Loans become due and payable pursuant to Section 8).
Each Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the appropriate Lender on the unpaid principal amount of the
Loans made to such Borrower from time to time outstanding from the date hereof
until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum, and on the dates, set
forth in Section 2.15.

         (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to time, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
under this Agreement.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrowers, shall
maintain the Register pursuant to Section 10.6(d), and a subaccount therein for
each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder and any Note evidencing such Loan, the Type of such Loan and each
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder from any Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

         (d) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender
maintained pursuant to Section 2.8(b) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be PRIMA FACIE evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations of each Borrower therein recorded; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or
any such account, or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the
obligation

such Lender during the period for which payment is made, payable quarterly in

Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans and Swing Line Loans) accrued
interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Term Loans
and Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount of

prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, 1.5% of the principal amount
of such prepayment and (ii) if such prepayment is made on or after the first
anniversary of the Closing Date and prior to the date that is eighteen months
after the Closing Date, 0.5% of the principal amount of such prepayment. Any

year, 0% of such Net Cash Proceeds and (B) with respect to the Net Cash Proceeds
of any Asset Sale or Recovery Event consummated in any fiscal year to the extent
such Net Cash Proceeds are not covered by the foregoing sub-clause (A), 100% of
such Net Cash Proceeds and (iii) if the assets subject to such Disposition are
not insurance-related businesses or assets and a Reinvestment Notice is
delivered in respect of such Net Cash Proceeds on or prior to the date of
receipt or such Net Cash Proceeds, 0% of such Net Cash Proceeds. For purposes of
determining the amount of Net Cash Proceeds of any Disposition to be allocated
to sub-clause (A) and sub-clause (B), respectively, of clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence in the case of any Disposition to which both such sub-clauses
apply, the amount of Net Cash Proceeds allocated to such sub-clause (B) shall be
the aggregate amount of such Net Cash Proceeds multiplied by a fraction (not to
exceed 1.0), the numerator of which is the amount of Capital and Surplus
Disposed of in such Disposition and all prior Dispositions during such fiscal
year in excess of 10% of combined Capital and Surplus of all Insurance
Subsidiaries as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of Capital and Surplus Disposed
of in such Disposition. In addition, in the event any Reinvestment Notice is
delivered in respect of any Reinvestment Event, then, on the Reinvestment
Prepayment Date applicable to such Reinvestment Event, the Term Loans shall be
prepaid, and/or the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be reduced, by an amount
equal to the Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant
Reinvestment Event, as set forth in Section 2.12(d).

         (c) Unless the Required Prepayment Lenders and the Primary Borrower
shall otherwise agree, if, on the Closing Date, the aggregate unassigned surplus
of dividend-paying first-tier Insurance Subsidiaries is less than $950,000,000
(it being understood that such aggregate unassigned surplus shall not be less
than $900,000,000) and the Primary Borrower has received (in accordance with
Section 5.1(b)(iv)(A)), as the proceeds of equity issued to the Parent, the
amount by which such aggregate unassigned surplus is less than $950,000,000, the
Commitments shall be reduced by such amount immediately prior to the making of
Loans on the Closing Date as set forth in Section 2.12(d).

         (d) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments and Commitment
reductions made pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section shall be
applied, FIRST, to the

                                                                              36


prepayment of the Term Loans and, SECOND, to reduce permanently the Revolving
Credit Commitments; PROVIDED, that the Revolving Credit Commitments shall not be
reduced to less that $100,000,000 pursuant to this Section 2.12. Amounts to be
applied in connection with Commitment reductions made pursuant to paragraph (c)
of this Section shall be applied to reduce the Commitments pro rata according to
the respective principal amounts of the Tranche A Term Loan Commitment, the
Tranche B Term Loan Commitment and the Revolving Credit Commitment. Any
reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to this Section shall be
accompanied by prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans and/or Swing Line Loans
to the extent, if any, that the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed the
amount of the Total Revolving Credit Commitments as so reduced, PROVIDED that if
the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans
then outstanding is less than the amount of such excess (because L/C Obligations
constitute a portion thereof), the Primary Borrower shall, to the extent of the
balance of such excess, replace outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an
amount in cash in a cash collateral account established with the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

         2.13 CONVERSION AND CONTINUATION OPTIONS. (a) Each Borrower may elect
from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans made to such Borrower to Base Rate
Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election, provided that any such conversion of
Eurodollar Loans may be made only on the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto. Each Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Base Rate
Loans made to such Borrower to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative
Agent at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable notice of such election
(which notice shall specify the length of the initial Interest Period therefor),
PROVIDED that no Base Rate Loan under a particular Facility may be converted
into a Eurodollar Loan (i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and the Administrative Agent has, or the Majority Facility Lenders in
respect of such Facility have, determined in its or their sole discretion not to
permit such conversions or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the
final scheduled termination or maturity date of such Facility. Upon receipt of
any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant
Lender thereof.

         (b) Each Borrower may elect to continue any Eurodollar Loan made to
such Borrower as such upon the expiration of the then current Interest Period
with respect thereto by giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent,
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set
forth in Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable
to such Loans, PROVIDED that no Eurodollar Loan under a particular Facility may
be continued as such (i) when any Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and the Administrative Agent has, or the Majority Facility Lenders in
respect of such Facility have, determined in its or their sole discretion not to
permit such continuations or (ii) after the date that is one month prior to the
final scheduled termination or maturity date of such Facility, and PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that if the relevant Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as
described above in this paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted
pursuant to the preceding proviso, such Loans shall be converted automatically
to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest Period. Upon
receipt of any such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
relevant Lender thereof.

         2.14 MINIMUM AMOUNTS AND MAXIMUM NUMBER OF EURODOLLAR TRANCHES.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings,
conversions, continuations and optional prepayments of Eurodollar Loans and all
selections of Interest Periods shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to
such elections so that, (a) after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal
amount of the Eurodollar Loans comprising each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal
to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no
more than ten Eurodollar Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

         2.15 INTEREST RATES AND PAYMENT DATES. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such day plus the
Applicable Margin.

         (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

         (c) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest
at a rate per annum that is equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that
would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section PLUS 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility PLUS 2%, and
(ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement
Obligation or any commitment fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be
paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),
such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate
then applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility PLUS 2% (or, in
the case of any such other amounts that do not relate to a particular Facility,
the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility
PLUS 2%), in each case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the
date of such non-payment until such amount is paid in full (after as well as
before judgment).

         (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date,
PROVIDED that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall
be payable from time to time on demand.

         2.16 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. (a) Interest, fees, commissions
payable pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for
the actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans on which
interest is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest thereon
shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day (or 366-day, as the case may be)
year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each
determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan
resulting from a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve
Requirements shall become effective as of the opening of business on the day on
which such change becomes effective. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the
effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

                                                                              38


         (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrowers and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the any Borrower, deliver to such
Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in
determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 2.15(a) with respect to Loans
made to such Borrower.

         2.17 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE. If prior to the first day of
any Interest Period:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
         determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the relevant
         Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant
         market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the
         Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
         the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility that
         the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest
         Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
         (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or maintaining
         their affected Loans during such Interest Period,

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to the
relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter. If
such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar Loans under the relevant Facility
requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made as
Base Rate Loans, (y) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to have
been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurodollar Loans
shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans
under the relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then
current Interest Period with respect thereto, to Base Rate Loans. Until such
notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further Eurodollar
Loans under the relevant Facility shall be made or continued as such, nor shall
the relevant Borrower have the right to convert Loans under the relevant
Facility to Eurodollar Loans.

         2.18 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS. (a) Each borrowing by any
Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by any Borrower on account of
any commitment fee or Letter of Credit fee, and any reduction of the Commitments
of the Lenders, shall be made pro rata according to the respective Tranche A
Term Loan Percentages, Tranche B Term Loan Percentages or Revolving Credit
Percentages, as the case may be, of the relevant Lenders. Each payment (other
than prepayments) in respect of principal or interest in respect of the Term
Loans and each payment in respect of fees payable hereunder shall be applied to
the amounts of such obligations owing to the Lenders PRO RATA according to the
respective amounts then due and owing to the Lenders.

         (b) Subject to Section 2.18(d), each mandatory prepayment required by
Section 2.12 to be applied to Term Loans shall be allocated between the Term
Loan Facilities PRO RATA according to the respective outstanding principal
amounts of Term Loans under such Facilities. Subject to Section 2.18(d), each
optional prepayment in respect of the Term Loans shall be


<PAGE>


                                                                              39


allocated between the Term Loan Facilities PRO RATA according to the respective
outstanding principal amounts of Term Loans under such Facilities. Each payment
(including each prepayment) of the Term Loans outstanding under any Term Loan
Facility shall be allocated among the Term Loan Lenders holding such Term Loans
PRO RATA based on the principal amount of such Term Loans held by such Term Loan
Lenders, and shall be applied (i) in the case of mandatory prepayments pursuant
to Section 2.12(b), to the installments thereof PRO RATA based on the remaining
outstanding principal amount of such installments, and (ii) in the case of all
other prepayments, FIRST, to the next scheduled installment thereof to be due
after the date of such prepayment, and, SECOND, to the remaining installments
PRO RATA based on the remaining outstanding principal amount of such
installments. Amounts prepaid on account of the Term Loans may not be
reborrowed.

         (c) Each payment (including each prepayment) by any Borrower on account
of principal of and interest on the Revolving Credit Loans of such Borrower
shall be made PRO RATA according to the respective outstanding principal amounts
of the Revolving Credit Loans of such Borrower then held by the Revolving Credit
Lenders. Each payment in respect of Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any
Letter of Credit shall be made to the relevant Issuing Lender.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Sections 2.11, 2.12 or
2.18(b), so long as any Tranche A Term Loans are outstanding, each Tranche B
Term Loan Lender may, at its option, decline up to 100% of the portion of any
optional prepayment or mandatory payment applicable to the Tranche B Term Loans
of such Lender; accordingly, with respect to the amount of any optional
prepayment described in Section 2.11 or mandatory prepayment described in
Section 2.12 that is allocated to Tranche B Term Loans (such amounts,
respectively, the "OPTIONAL PREPAYMENT AMOUNT" and the "MANDATORY PREPAYMENT
AMOUNT"), at any time when Tranche A Term Loans remain outstanding, the Primary
Borrower will:

                  (i) in the case of any optional prepayment of the Tranche B
         Term Loans which the Primary Borrower wishes to make, give the
         Administrative Agent telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing)
         requesting that the Administrative Agent prepare and provide to each
         Tranche B Term Loan Lender a notice (each, a "PREPAYMENT OPTION
         NOTICE") as described below; and

                  (ii) in the case of any mandatory prepayment required to be
         made pursuant to Section 2.12, on the date specified in Section 2.12
         for such prepayment, (A) give the Administrative Agent telephonic
         notice (promptly confirmed in writing) requesting that the
         Administrative Agent prepare and provide to each Tranche B Term Loan
         Lender a Prepayment Option Notice as described below and (B) deposit
         with the Administrative Agent the Mandatory Prepayment Amount.

         As promptly as practicable after receiving such notice from the Primary
Borrower, the Administrative Agent will send to each Tranche B Term Loan Lender
a Prepayment Option Notice, which shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit
H, and shall include an offer by the Primary Borrower to prepay on the
Prepayment Date the Tranche B Term Loans of such Lender by an amount equal to
the portion of the Optional Prepayment Amount or Mandatory Prepayment Amount, as
the case may be, indicated in such Lender's Prepayment Option Notice

<PAGE>


                                                                              40


as being applicable to such Lender's Tranche B Term Loans. The "PREPAYMENT DATE"
in respect of any Prepayment Option Notice shall be the date which is (i) in the
case of a Prepayment Option Notice relating to an optional prepayment, the later
of (A) three Business Days after the date of such Prepayment Option Notice and
(B) the date on which the Primary Borrower has advised the Administrative Agent
that it wishes to make such optional prepayment and (ii) in the case of a
Prepayment Option Notice relating to a mandatory prepayment, the date which is
three Business Days after the date of such Prepayment Option Notice.

         On the Prepayment Date:

                  (i) in the case of any optional prepayment, the Primary
         Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent the Optional Prepayment
         Amount, and the Administrative Agent shall (A) apply the Optional
         Prepayment toward prepayment of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loans in
         respect of which Lenders have accepted optional prepayment as described
         above and (B) apply the remaining portion of the Optional Prepayment
         Amount not accepted by the Tranche B Term Loan Lenders toward
         prepayment of the Tranche A Term Loans; and

                  (ii) in the case of any mandatory prepayment, the
         Administrative Agent shall (A) apply the Mandatory Prepayment Amount
         toward prepayment of the outstanding Tranche B Term Loans in respect of
         which Lenders have accepted mandatory prepayment as described above and
         (B) apply the remaining portion of the Mandatory Prepayment Amount not
         accepted by the Tranche B Term Loan Lenders toward prepayment of the
         Tranche A Term Loans.

The procedures described above in this paragraph (d) shall not be applicable in
the case of a prepayment in full of all Term Loans.

         (e) The application of any payment of Loans under any Facility
(including optional and mandatory prepayments) shall be made, FIRST, to Base
Rate Loans under such Facility and, SECOND, to Eurodollar Loans under such
Facility. Each payment of the Loans (except in the case of Swing Line Loans and
Revolving Credit Loans that are Base Rate Loans) shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the date of such payment on the amount paid.

         (f) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by any Borrower
hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall
be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon,
New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the relevant Lenders, at the Payment Office, in Dollars and in
immediately available funds. Any payment made by any Borrower after 12:00 Noon,
New York City time, on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been made on the
next following Business Day. The Administrative Agent shall distribute such
payments to the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any
payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes
due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such
extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which
event such payment


<PAGE>


                                                                              41


shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In the case of any
extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding two sentences,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension.

         (g) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount
that would constitute its share of such borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is
making such amount available to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made available to the
Administrative Agent by the required time on the Borrowing Date therefor, such
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective
Rate for the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to
the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to
any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such
borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
within three Business Days after such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent
shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate
per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility, on demand,
from the relevant Borrower.

         (h) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by a Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by such Borrower
hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment to the Administrative
Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower is making such
payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required to, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders their respective
pro rata shares of a corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the
Administrative Agent by such Borrower within three Business Days after such due
date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from
each Lender to which any amount which was made available pursuant to the
preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum
equal to the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against any
Borrower.

         2.19 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance
by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made subsequent to
the date hereof:

                  (i) shall subject any Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever
         with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any Application
         or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of
         payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Non-Excluded
         Taxes covered by Section 2.20 and changes in the rate of tax on the
         overall net income of such Lender);

                  (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
         special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets
         held by, deposits or other liabilities


<PAGE>


                                                                              42


         in or for the account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit
         by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender
         that is not otherwise included in the determination of the Eurodollar
         Rate hereunder; or

                  (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining Eurodollar Loans or issuing or participating in
Letters of Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect
thereof, then, in any such case, the Primary Borrower shall promptly pay such
Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable. If any Lender
becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it
shall promptly notify the Primary Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) of the event by reason of which it has become so entitled.

         (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof shall have the effect of reducing
the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of
Credit to a level below that which such Lender or such corporation could have
achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy)
by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time, after
submission by such Lender to the Primary Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) of a written request therefor, the Primary Borrower shall
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or such corporation for such reduction.

         (c) In addition to, and without duplication of, amounts which may
become payable from time to time pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 2.19, the Primary Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender which requests
compensation under this paragraph (c) by notice to the Primary Borrower, on the
last day of each Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan made by
such Lender, at any time when such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves
against "Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System (or, at any time when such Lender may be required
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or by any other
Governmental Authority, whether within the United States or in another relevant
jurisdiction, to maintain reserves against any other category of liabilities
which includes deposits by reference to which the Eurodollar Rate is determined
as provided in this Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or
other assets of such Lender which includes any such Eurodollar Loans), an
additional amount (determined by such Lender's calculation or, if an accurate
calculation is impracticable, reasonable estimate using such reasonable means of
allocation as such Lender shall determine) equal to the actual costs, if any,
incurred by such Lender during such Interest Period as a result of the
applicability of the foregoing reserves to such Eurodollar Loans.

                                                                              43


         (d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section submitted by any Lender to the Primary Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The
obligations of the Primary Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

         2.20 TAXES. (a) Except as required by law, all payments made by each
Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income,
stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise and
doing business taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on the
Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former connection
between the Administrative Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the
Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising solely from
the Administrative Agent's or such Lender's having executed, delivered or
performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("NON-EXCLUDED
TAXES") or any Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to
the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent
necessary to yield to the Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of
all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts
payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Borrower shall be required to increase any such
amounts payable to any Lender with respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that
are attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the requirements of
paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section or (ii) that are withholding taxes imposed
on amounts payable to such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to
this Agreement, except to the extent that such Lender's assignor (if any) was
entitled, at the time of assignment, to receive additional amounts from such
Borrower with respect to such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to Section 2.20(a).

         (b) In addition, the Primary Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by any
Borrower, as soon as practicable thereafter such Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant
Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an official receipt received by
such Borrower showing payment thereof (or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent). If any Borrower fails to
pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, such Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as a
result of any such failure. The agreements in this Section 2.20 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

         (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a citizen or resident of
the United States of America, a corporation, partnership or other entity created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any
jurisdiction thereof), or any estate or trust that is subject to federal income
taxation regardless of the source of its income (a "NON-U.S. LENDER") shall
deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a
Participant, to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been
purchased) two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
Form W-8ECI (or other applicable form), or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender
claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or
881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of "portfolio interest" a statement
substantially in the form of Exhibit I and a Form W-8BEN (or other applicable
form), or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto properly
completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming complete exemption
from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on all payments by any
Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Such forms shall be
delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it becomes a party to
this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or before the date such
Participant purchases the related participation). In addition, each Non-U.S.
Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the obsolescence or invalidity of
any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S. Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender
shall promptly notify the each Borrower at any time it determines that it is no
longer in a position to provide any previously delivered certificate to such
Borrower (or any other form of certification adopted by the U.S. taxing
authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to deliver any form pursuant
to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not legally able to deliver.

         (e) A Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which a Borrower
is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to
payments under this Agreement shall deliver to such Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by such Borrower, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, PROVIDED that such Lender is
legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver such documentation and in such
Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would not
materially prejudice the legal position of such Lender.

         2.21 INDEMNITY. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender for, and
to hold each Lender harmless from, any loss or expense that such Lender sustains
or incurs as a consequence of (a) default by such Borrower in making a borrowing
of, conversion into or continuation of Eurodollar Loans after such Borrower has
given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (b) default by such Borrower in making any prepayment after such
Borrower has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement or (c) the making by such Borrower of a prepayment or conversion of
Eurodollar Loans on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with
respect thereto; PROVIDED that any request for indemnification made by a Lender
pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be made within six months of the incurrence
of the loss or expense requested to be indemnified. Such indemnification may
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted
or continued,

<PAGE>


                                                                              45


for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
convert or continue to the last day of such Interest Period (or, in the case of
a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that would have
commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable rate of
interest for such Loans provided for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable
Margin included therein, if any) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably
determined by such Lender) that would have accrued to such Lender on such amount
by placing such amount on deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in
the interbank Eurodollar market. A certificate as to any amounts payable
pursuant to this Section submitted to any Borrower by any Lender shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. This covenant shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

         2.22 ILLEGALITY. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such
Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and
convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be canceled and (b)
such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be
converted automatically to Base Rate Loans on the respective last days of the
then current Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier
period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on
a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto, the relevant Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as
may be required pursuant to Section 2.21.

         2.23 CHANGE OF LENDING OFFICE. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event that it knows to give rise to the operation of Section
2.19, 2.20(a) or 2.22 with respect to such Lender, it will use all commercially
reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to
designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event, or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder with respect to such Loans to
another of its offices, branches or affiliates with the object of avoiding the
consequences of such event, or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder
with respect to such Loans to another of its offices, branches or affiliates,
with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; PROVIDED, that such
designation is made on terms that, in the reasonable sole judgment of such
Lender, cause such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal
or regulatory disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section
shall affect or postpone any of the obligations of any Borrower or the rights of
any Lender pursuant to Section 2.19, 2.20(a) or 2.22.

         2.24 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. The Primary
Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender (a) that requests
reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19, (b) with respect to
which any Borrower is required to pay any amounts under Section 2.20 or (c) that
defaults in its obligation to make Loans hereunder, with a replacement financial
institution; PROVIDED that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any
Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such replacement, (iii) prior to any such replacement,
such Lender shall have taken no action under Section 2.22 so as to eliminate the
continued need for payment of amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.19 or 2.20,
(iv) the replacement financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans


<PAGE>


                                                                              46


and other amounts owing to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of
replacement, (v) such Borrower shall be liable to such replaced Lender under
Section 2.21 (as though Section 2.21 were applicable) if any Eurodollar Loan
owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day of
the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial
institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, (vii) the replaced Lender and replacement Lender shall be
obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section
10.6 (including, without limitation, obtaining the consents provided for
therein) (provided that the relevant Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
registration and processing fee referred to therein), (viii) the relevant
Borrower shall pay all additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section
2.19 or 2.20, as the case may be, in respect of any period prior to the date on
which such replacement shall be consummated, and (ix) any such replacement shall
not be deemed to be a waiver of any rights that the relevant Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

         2.25 OPTIONAL COMMITMENT INCREASE. (a) The Primary Borrower shall have
the right at any one time during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary thereof to increase the Total Revolving Credit
Commitments to an aggregate amount not to exceed $200,000,000 (i) by requesting
in writing that any Lender or Lenders increase the amount of each such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment or (ii) if, within 21 days of receipt of such
request Lenders have not indicated their willingness to increase the Total
Revolving Credit Commitments to the requested amount, by requesting that one or
more banks or other financial institutions not a party to this Agreement become
a Lender or Lenders hereunder; provided, that (x) the addition of any bank or
financial institution becoming a Lender pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be
subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), (y) the Revolving Credit Commitment of any bank or other
financial institution becoming a Lender pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be
at least $10,000,000 (except that in the event that the aggregate amount of the
increase of Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to clause (i) above shall be
greater than $40,000,000 and less than $50,000,000, the Revolving Credit
Commitment of one bank or financial institution becoming a Lender pursuant to
clause (ii) above may be less than $10,000,000) and (z) the amount of the
increase of any Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to clause (i)
above shall be at least $5,000,000.

         (b) Any increase in the Total Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to
Section 2.25(a)(i) shall be effective only upon the execution and delivery to
the Primary Borrower and the Administrative Agent of a commitment increase
supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit K (a "REVOLVING COMMITMENT
INCREASE SUPPLEMENT"), which Revolving Commitment Increase Supplement shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent not less than five Business Days prior to
the date on which the increase provided for therein is to become effective (the
"REVOLVING COMMITMENT INCREASE DATE") and shall specify (i) the amount of any
increase in the Revolving Credit Commitment of any Lender and (ii) the Revolving
Commitment Increase Date.

         (c) Any additional bank, financial institution or other entity which
elects to become a party to this Agreement and provide a Revolving Credit
Commitment pursuant to Section 2.25 (a)(ii) shall execute a New Lender
Supplement (each, a "NEW LENDER SUPPLEMENT") with the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent, substantially in the form of Exhibit L. Upon its receipt
of a New Lender Supplement executed by an additional bank, financial institution
or


<PAGE>


                                                                              47


other entity which elects to become a party to this Agreement and provide a
Revolving Credit Commitment pursuant to Section 2.25(a)(ii) (and which has been
approved by the Administrative Agent as provided in Section 2.25(a)), the
Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such New Lender Supplement and
(ii) record the information and Revolving Credit Commitment contained therein in
the Register on the effective date determined pursuant thereto, whereupon such
bank, financial institution or other entity shall become a Lender for all
purposes and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be
bound by and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.

         (d) If the Total Revolving Credit Commitments are increased pursuant to
this Section 2.25, the amount of such increase shall, from and after the
Revolving Commitment Increase Date, be available for usage by the Additional
Borrower as Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit (it being understood
that such amount shall not be available for usage by the Additional Borrower as
Swingline Loans); PROVIDED that not more than $10,000,000 of the L/C Commitment
shall be available to the Additional Borrower for the issuance of Letters of
Credit in accordance with Section 3.

         (e) Any increase in the Total Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to
this Section 2.25 shall not be effective unless:

                  (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
         continuing on the Revolving Commitment Increase Date;

                  (ii) each of the representations and warranties made by each
         Borrower in Section 4, or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto,
         shall be true and correct in all material respects on the Revolving
         Commitment Increase Date with the same effect as though made on and as
         of such date, except to the extent such representations and warranties
         expressly relate to an earlier date in which case such representations
         and warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
         such earlier date; and

                  (iii) the Administrative Agent shall have received such
         corporate resolutions, legal opinions and other documents which it
         shall reasonably request with respect to the obligations of the
         Additional Borrower hereunder.

         Each notice requesting an increase in the Total Revolving Credit
Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.25 shall constitute a certification to
the effect set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 2.25(e).

         (f) No Lender shall at any time be required to agree to a request of
the Primary Borrower to increase its Revolving Credit Commitment or obligations
hereunder.


                          SECTION 3 LETTERS OF CREDIT

         3.1 L/C COMMITMENT. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each Issuing Lender, in reliance on the agreements of the other Revolving Credit
Lenders set forth in Section 3.4(a), agrees to issue letters of credit ("LETTERS
OF CREDIT") for the account of the Primary Borrower (or, from and after the
Revolving Commitment Increase Date and subject to the

<PAGE>


                                                                              48


limitations set forth in Section 2.25, the Additional Borrower) on any Business
Day during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period in such form as may be
approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender; PROVIDED, that no Issuing
Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if, after giving
effect to such issuance, (i) the L/C Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment
or (ii) the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments would
be less than zero. Each Letter of Credit shall (i) be denominated in Dollars and
(ii) expire no later than the earlier of (x) the first anniversary of its date
of issuance and (y) the date which is five Business Days prior to the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term
may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall
in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (y) above).

         (b) No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any
Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such
Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any
applicable Requirement of Law.

         3.2 PROCEDURE FOR ISSUANCE OF LETTER OF CREDIT. The Primary Borrower
(or, from and after the Revolving Commitment Increase Date and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 2.25, the Additional Borrower) may from time to
time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to
such Issuing Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) at its address for
notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction
of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers
and information as such Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of any
Application, an Issuing Lender will process such Application and the
certificates, documents and other papers and information delivered to it in
connection therewith in accordance with its customary procedures and shall
promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested thereby by issuing the original of
such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed
to by such Issuing Lender and the relevant Borrower (but in no event shall any
Issuing Lender be required to issue any Letter of Credit earlier than three
Business Days after its receipt of the Application therefor and all such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information relating thereto).
Promptly after issuance by an Issuing Lender of a Letter of Credit, such Issuing
Lender shall furnish a copy of such Letter of Credit to the relevant Borrower.
Each Issuing Lender shall, within three days of such issuance, give notice to
the Administrative Agent of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by such
Issuing Lender (including the amount thereof). Upon the written request of any
Revolving Credit Lender, the Administrative Agent will, within three Business
Days of such request, inform such Revolving Credit Lender of the aggregate
drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued to the Borrowers on
the date of such request.

         3.3 FEES AND OTHER CHARGES. (a) Each Borrower will pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Revolving Credit Lenders, a fee on
the aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued for
such Borrower's account at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then
in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility,
to be shared ratably among the Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance with their
respective Revolving Credit Percentages and payable quarterly in arrears on each
L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, each Borrower shall
pay to the relevant Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee on the
aggregate drawable amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Lender for such Borrower's account at a rate

<PAGE>


                                                                              49


to be agreed upon by such Borrower and such Issuing Lender, payable quarterly in
arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the date of issuance of such Letter
of Credit.

         (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the relevant Borrower shall pay
or reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and
expenses as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing,
negotiating, effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any
Letter of Credit.

         3.4 L/C PARTICIPATIONS. (a) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees to
grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce each Issuing
Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably
agrees to accept and purchase and hereby accepts and purchases from each Issuing
Lender, on the terms and conditions hereinafter stated, for such L/C
Participant's own account and risk, an undivided interest equal to such L/C
Participant's Revolving Credit Percentage in each Issuing Lender's obligations
and rights under each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender hereunder
and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder. Each L/C
Participant unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with each Issuing Lender
that, if a draft is paid under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender for which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the relevant
Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant
shall pay to such Issuing Lender upon demand at such Issuing Lender's address
for notices specified herein an amount equal to such L/C Participant's Revolving
Credit Percentage of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not
so reimbursed.

         (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to an
Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.4(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion
of any payment made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to
such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date such payment is
due, such L/C Participant shall pay to such Issuing Lender on demand an amount
equal to the product of (i) such amount, times (ii) the daily average Federal
Funds Effective Rate during the period from and including the date such payment
is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such
Issuing Lender, times (iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
days that elapse during such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any
such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section
3.4(a) is not made available to such Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant
within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing
Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such
amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility. A certificate
of such Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any such
amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest
error.

         (c) Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment
under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its PRO
RATA share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing
Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly
from the relevant Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral
applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account
thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its PRO
RATA share thereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that any such payment
received by such Issuing Lender shall be

<PAGE>


                                                                              50


required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall
return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such
Issuing Lender to it.

         3.5 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION OF THE BORROWERS. Each Borrower agrees to
reimburse each Issuing Lender, on the next Business Day after each date on which
such Issuing Lender notifies such Borrower of the date and amount of a draft
presented under any Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower's account and paid
by such Issuing Lender, for the amount of (a) such draft so paid and (b) any
taxes, fees, charges or other costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender
in connection with such payment (the amounts described in the foregoing clauses
(a) and (b) in respect of any drawing, collectively, the "PAYMENT AMOUNT"). Each
such payment shall be made to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices
specified herein in lawful money of the United States of America and in
immediately available funds. Interest shall be payable on each Payment Amount
from the date of the applicable drawing until payment in full at the rate set
forth in (i) until the second Business Day following the date of the applicable
drawing, Section 2.15(b) and (ii) thereafter, Section 2.15(c). Each drawing
under any Letter of Credit issued for either Borrower's account shall (unless an
event of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 8(f) shall have
occurred and be continuing with respect to such Borrower, in which case the
procedures specified in Section 3.4 for funding by L/C Participants shall apply)
constitute a request by such Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a
borrowing pursuant to Section 2.5 of Base Rate Loans (or, in the case of the
Primary Borrower, at the option of the Administrative Agent and the Swing Line
Lender in their sole discretion, a borrowing pursuant to Section 2.7 of Swing
Line Loans) in the amount of such drawing. The Borrowing Date with respect to
such borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Credit
Loans (or, if applicable, Swing Line Loans) could be made, pursuant to Section
2.5 (or, if applicable, Section 2.7), if the Administrative Agent had received a
notice of such borrowing at the time the Administrative Agent receives notice
from the relevant Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.

         3.6 OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. Each Borrower's obligations under this
Section 3 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances
and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that any
Borrower may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a
Letter of Credit or any other Person. Each Borrower also agrees with each
Issuing Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and such
Borrower's Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by,
among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any
endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be
invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among such Borrower and
any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter
of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of such Borrower against
any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing
Lender shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in
transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however
transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or
omissions found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Issuing Lender. Each Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an
Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it for
the account of such Borrower or the related drafts or documents, if done in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in accordance with the
standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in the
State of

<PAGE>


                                                                              51


New York (the "UCC") or, if applicable to such Letter of Credit, the Uniform
Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits as published by the International
Chamber of Commerce most recently at the time of issuance of any Letter of
Credit (the "UCP"), shall be binding on the Borrower and shall not result in any
liability of such Issuing Lender to such Borrower.

         3.7 LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS. If any draft shall be presented for
payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall promptly
notify the relevant Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility
of the relevant Issuing Lender to the relevant Borrower in connection with any
draft presented for payment under any Letter of Credit, in addition to any
payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Lender, shall be limited to determining that the documents
(including each draft) delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with
such presentment appear on their face to be in conformity with such Letter of
Credit.

         3.8 APPLICATIONS. To the extent that any provision of any Application
related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.


                    SECTION 4 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to enter into this
Agreement and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of

represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and each Lender and (ii) the
Additional Borrower, upon becoming a Borrower hereunder, shall be deemed to
represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and each Lender that:

         4.1 FINANCIAL CONDITION. (a) The estimated pro forma consolidated
balance sheet of the Primary Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at
September 30, 2000 (including the notes thereto) (the "PRO FORMA BALANCE

consummation of the Acquisition, (ii) the Loans to be made and the use of
proceeds thereof, (iii) the other financing transactions to be consummated in
connection with the Acquisition, (iv) an increase in reserves of at least

Agreements described in Section 5.1(m) and (vii) the payment of fees and
expenses in connection with the foregoing. The Pro Forma Balance Sheet has been

estimated financial position of Primary Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2000, assuming that the events specified in the
preceding sentence had actually occurred at such date, and the PRO FORMA balance

         (b) The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheets and
consolidated income statements of the entities comprising the Acquired Assets as

rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in
respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial
statements referred to in this paragraph. During the period from December 31,
1999 to and including the date hereof there has been no Disposition by the
entities comprising the Acquired Assets of any material part of their business
or Property, except for the Preclosing Transactions.

         (c) The audited consolidated balance sheets of White Mountains as at

and cash flows for the nine-month period ended on such date, present fairly the
consolidated financial condition of White Mountains as at such date, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the
nine-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All
such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto,

periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firms of accountants

material Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for
taxes, or any long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments,

September 30, 2000, and the related unaudited consolidated statements of income
and cash flows for the nine-month period ended on such date, present fairly the
consolidated financial condition of CGU as at such date, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the nine-month
period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All such
financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the
periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firms of accountants
and disclosed therein). CGU and its Subsidiaries do not have any material
Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any
long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including, without
limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange transaction
or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the
most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph. During the
period from September 30, 2000 to and including the date hereof there has been
no Disposition by CGU of any material part of its business or Property other
than the Preclosing Transactions.

         (e) The audited combined financial statements of admitted assets,
liabilities and Capital and Surplus of the Insurance Subsidiaries of CGU as at
December 31, 1999, and the related combined statements of income, Capital and
Surplus and cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such date, reported on by
and accompanied by unqualified reports from PricewaterhouseCoopers, present
fairly the combined financial condition of the Insurance Subsidiaries of CGU as
at such date, and the combined results of their operations and their combined
cash flows for the respective fiscal years then ended. All such financial
statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with SAP applied consistently throughout the periods
involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firms of accountants and
disclosed therein). The Insurance Subsidiaries of CGU do not have any material
Guarantee Obligations, contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any
long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments, including, without

or other obligation in respect of derivatives, that are not reflected in the
most recent financial statements referred to in this paragraph. During the
period from December 31, 1999 to and including the date hereof there has been no
Disposition by CGU of any material part of the business or Property of its
Insurance Subsidiaries, except for the Preclosing Transactions.

         The representations and warranties set forth in paragraphs (a), (b),
(d) and (e) above are qualified in their entirety by the Specified Exceptions.

         4.2 NO CHANGE. (a) Up to and including the Closing Date (prior to
giving effect to the consummation of the Acquisition), since December 31, 1999
and (b) from and including the Closing Date (after giving effect to the
Acquisition), since the Closing Date, there has been no development or event
that has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.3 CORPORATE EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Each of the Parent, each
Borrower and its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has
the corporate or other power and authority, and the legal right, to own and
operate its Property, to lease the Property it operates as lessee and to conduct
the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly qualified as a
foreign

                                                                              54


corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of Property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except to the extent failure to so qualify or be in
good standing could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (d) is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith could not, in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. It is
understood that this provision shall not imply a representation with respect to
environmental matters, which representation is set forth in Section 4.16.

         4.4 CORPORATE POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. Each Loan
Party has the corporate or other power and authority, and the legal right, to
make, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the
case of each Borrower, to borrow hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all
necessary corporate or other action to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of
each Borrower, to authorize the borrowings on the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act
by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required
in connection with the Acquisition, the borrowings hereunder or the execution,
delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, except (i) consents, authorizations, filings and
notices described in Schedule 4.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and
notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) the
filings referred to in Section 4.18, except to the extent failure to obtain any
consents, authorizations, filings and notices could not, in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Loan Document has
been duly executed and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party that is a party
thereto. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution
will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party that
is a party thereto, enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with
its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

         4.5 NO LEGAL BAR. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any
Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of the Parent, any Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries and will not result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any of their respective properties or revenues
pursuant to any Requirement of Law or any such Contractual Obligation (other
than the Liens created by the Security Documents), except to the extent such
violation or Lien could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         4.6 NO MATERIAL LITIGATION. No litigation, investigation or proceeding
of or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Parent or any Borrower, threatened by or against the Parent,
any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of their respective
properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

<PAGE>


                                                                              55


         4.7 NO DEFAULT. Neither the Parent, any Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any of its Contractual
Obligations in any respect that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.
It is understood that CGU and/or its Subsidiaries have lost the right to
remarket Industrial Revenue Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not greater
than $30,750,000 as a result of the loss or withdrawal of a credit rating and
are being required to repurchase the bonds as remarket dates occur.

         4.8 OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Each of the Parent, each Borrower and
its Subsidiaries has title in fee simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in,
all its real property, and good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all
its other Property, and none of such Property is subject to any Lien except as
permitted by Section 7.3, except to the extent such defects in title could not,
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Parent, each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual Property necessary
for the conduct of its business as currently conducted. No material claim has
been asserted and is pending by any Person challenging or questioning the use of
any Intellectual Property or the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual
Property, nor does the Parent or any Borrower know of any valid basis for any
such claim. The use of Intellectual Property by the Parent, each Borrower and
its Subsidiaries does not infringe on the rights of any Person in any material
respect. It is understood that the Primary Borrower and its Subsidiaries will be
permitted to use the CGU name and related tradenames for (i) with respect to
Insurance Subsidiaries, a period of eighteen months after the Closing Date (with
conditional six-month extensions through September 24, 2005 in jurisdictions
where regulatory approval for name changes has not been received) but not
thereafter and (ii) with respect to Non-Insurance Subsidiaries, a period of 180
days after the Closing Date but not thereafter.

         4.10 TAXES. Each of the Parent, each Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has filed or caused to be filed all material Federal, state and
other tax returns that are required to be filed (taking into account any
applicable extensions) and has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on
said returns or on any assessments made against it or any of its Property and
all other material taxes, fees or other charges imposed on it or any of its
Property by any Governmental Authority (other than any the amount or validity of
which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
with respect to which reserves in conformity with SAP or GAAP, as applicable,
have been provided on the books of the Parent, any Borrower or its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be); and, to the knowledge of the Parent and each Borrower, no
tax Lien has been filed, and no claim is being asserted, with respect to any
such tax, fee or other charge.

         4.11 FEDERAL REGULATIONS. No part of the proceeds of any Loans will be
used for "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective
meanings of each of the quoted terms under Regulation U as now and from time to
time hereafter in effect or for any purpose that violates the provisions of the
Regulations of the Board. If requested by any Lender or the Administrative
Agent, the relevant Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and each
Lender a statement to the foregoing effect in conformity with the requirements
of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U.

                                                                              56


         4.12 ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan, and each Plan
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA
and the Code. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has occurred, and no Lien
in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such five-year period, other
than in connection with acquisitions of Houston General Insurance Group, York
Insurance Company and A.W.G. Dewar, Inc. The present value of all accrued
benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to
fund such Plans) did not, as of the last annual valuation date prior to the date
on which this representation is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the
assets of such Plan allocable to such accrued benefits by an amount which, if
the Plan then terminated, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity of any
Borrower has had a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan
that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a material
liability under ERISA, and neither Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity
of any Borrower would become subject to any liability under ERISA which could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect if such Borrower
or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely from all
Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on
which this representation is made or deemed made. No such Multiemployer Plan is
in Reorganization or Insolvent.

         4.13 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; OTHER REGULATIONS. No Loan Party is an
"investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. No Loan
Party is subject to regulation under any Requirement of Law (other than
Regulation X of the Board) which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

         4.14 SUBSIDIARIES. (a) The Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 4.14
constitute all the Subsidiaries of the Primary Borrower on the Closing Date
after giving effect to the Acquisition and the Preclosing Transactions. Schedule
4.14 sets forth as of the date of this Agreement the name and jurisdiction of
incorporation of each such Subsidiary and, as to each such Subsidiary, the
percentage of each class of Capital Stock owned by each Loan Party.

         (b) There are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls,
rights or other agreements or commitments (other than stock options granted to
employees or directors and directors' qualifying shares) of any nature relating
to any Capital Stock of the Parent, the Primary Borrower or any Subsidiary,
except as disclosed on Schedule 4.14.

         4.15 USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loans, and the Letters of
Credit, shall be used to finance a portion of the Acquisition, to repay certain
existing indebtedness of CGU and its subsidiaries, to pay related fees and
expenses and for working capital and general corporate purposes of the relevant
Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.

                                                                              57


         4.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Other than exceptions to any of the
following that could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

                  (a) Each Borrower and its Subsidiaries: (i) are, and within
         the period of all applicable statutes of limitation have been, in
         compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws; (ii) hold all
         Environmental Permits (each of which is in full force and effect)
         required for any of their current operations or for any property owned,
         leased, or otherwise operated by any of them; and (iii) are, and within
         the period of all applicable statutes of limitation have been, in
         compliance with all of their Environmental Permits.

                  (b) Materials of Environmental Concern are not present at, on,
         under, in, or about any real property now and were not present at, on,
         under, in or about any real property formerly owned, leased or operated
         by any of them during the period of such ownership, lease or operation,
         owned, leased or operated by any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
         and neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (nor any entity
         for the actions of which any of them is responsible) has released or
         discharged any Materials of Environmental Concern at any property
         formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or at any other
         location (including, without limitation, any location to which
         Materials of Environmental Concern have been sent for re-use or
         recycling or for treatment, storage, or disposal) which could
         reasonably be expected to (i) give rise to liability of any Borrower or
         any of its Subsidiaries under any applicable Environmental Law, or (ii)
         adversely interfere with any Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries'
         continued operations.

                  (c) There is no judicial, administrative, or arbitral
         proceeding (including any notice of violation or alleged violation)
         under or relating to any Environmental Law to which any Borrower or any
         of its Subsidiaries is, or to the knowledge of the Parent or any
         Borrower will be, named as a party that is pending or, to the knowledge
         of the Parent or any Borrower threatened, nor has any Borrower nor any
         of its Subsidiaries received any request for information the subject of
         which could reasonably be expected to result in any of the foregoing.

                  (d) Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         received any written notice that it is a potentially responsible party
         under or relating to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
         Compensation, and Liability Act or any similar Environmental Law, or
         with respect to any Materials of Environmental Concern.

                  (e) Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         entered into or agreed to any consent decree, order, or settlement or
         other agreement, or is subject to any judgment, decree, or order or
         other agreement, in any judicial, administrative, arbitral, or other
         forum for dispute resolution, relating to compliance with or liability
         under any Environmental Law.

                  (f) Neither any Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         assumed or retained, by contract or operation of law, any liabilities
         of any kind, fixed or contingent, reasonably


<PAGE>


                                                                              58


         likely to form the basis for any claim under any Environmental Law or
         with respect to any Material of Environmental Concern.

                  (g) It is understood that Section 4.16 does not apply to
         claims made pursuant to policies for which any Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries is or is asserted to be responsible, issued pursuant to
         the insurance business of the Borrower and/or its Insurance
         Subsidiaries or to the settlement of any such claims.

         4.17 ACCURACY OF INFORMATION, ETC. No statement or information
contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Confidential
Information Memorandum or any other document, certificate or statement furnished
to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders or any of them, by or on behalf of
any Loan Party for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, contained as of the date such statement,
information, document or certificate was so furnished (or, in the case of the
Confidential Information Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement), any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading. The projections and pro forma financial information contained in the
materials referenced above are based upon good faith estimates and assumptions
believed by management of the Primary Borrower to be reasonable at the time
made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such financial information as it
relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact and that actual results
during the period or periods covered by such financial information may differ
from the projected results set forth therein by a material amount. As of the
date hereof, the representations and warranties contained in the Acquisition
Documentation are true and correct in all material respects. This Section 4.17
is qualified in its entirety by the Specified Exceptions.

         4.18 SECURITY DOCUMENTS. The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement is
effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral
described therein and proceeds thereof. In the case of the Pledged Stock
described in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, when any stock certificates
representing such Pledged Stock are delivered to the Administrative Agent, and
in the case of the other Collateral described in the Guarantee and Collateral
Agreement, when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in the
offices specified on Schedule 4.18-1 (which financing statements have been duly
completed and executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent) and such other
filings as are specified on Schedule 3 to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
have been completed (all documents required for which filings have been duly
completed and executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent), the Guarantee
and Collateral Agreement shall constitute a perfected Lien on, and security
interest in, all right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in such
Collateral and the proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations (as defined
in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement), in each case to the extent that such
security interest can be perfected by the delivery of stock certificates and
other instruments with effective indorsements, the filing of UCC financing
statements, and filings in respect of Intellectual Property in the United States
Patent and Trademarks Office. Schedule 4.18-2 lists each UCC Financing Statement
that (i) names any Loan Party (other than the Additional Borrower) as debtor and
(ii) will remain on file after the Closing Date. Schedule 4.18-3 lists each UCC
Financing Statement that (i) names any Loan Party (other than the Additional
Borrower) as debtor and (ii) will be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date;
and


<PAGE>


                                                                              59


on or prior to the Closing Date, the Primary Borrower will have delivered to the
Administrative Agent, or caused to be filed, duly completed UCC termination
statements, signed by the relevant secured party, in respect of each UCC
Financing Statement listed in Schedule 4.18-3.

         4.19 SOLVENCY. Each Loan Party is, and after giving effect to the
Acquisition and the incurrence of all Indebtedness and obligations being
incurred in connection herewith and therewith will be and will continue to be,
Solvent.

         4.20 INSURANCE REGULATORY MATTERS. No License of any Insurance
Subsidiary, the loss of which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, is the subject of a proceeding for suspension or revocation. To
the knowledge of the Parent or the Primary Borrower, there is no sustainable
basis for such suspension or revocation, and no such suspension or revocation
has been threatened by any Governmental Authority.


                         SECTION 5 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         5.1 CONDITIONS TO INITIAL EXTENSION OF CREDIT. The agreement of each
Lender to make the initial extension of credit requested to be made by it
hereunder is subject to the satisfaction, prior to or concurrently with the

         projections with respect to such fiscal year (collectively, the
         "PROJECTIONS"), which Projections shall in each case be accompanied by

         to be reasonable at the time made (it being recognized by the Lenders
         that such opinions, projections and forecasts as to any future event or
         state of affairs are not to be viewed as factual information and that
         actual results during the period or periods covered by any such
         opinion, projection or forecast may differ from the opinions and

franchises necessary or desirable in the normal conduct of its business, except,
in each case, as otherwise permitted by Section 7.4 and except, in the case of

extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect; and (b) comply with all Contractual Obligations and Requirements
of Law, except to the extent that failure to comply therewith could not, in the

         its Subsidiaries and any Governmental Authority, that in either case,

         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

                  (c) (i) any litigation or proceeding affecting the Parent, the
         Primary Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (other than claims-related

actions required by Article 8 of the UCC to cause the Administrative Agent to

shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it
or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final
and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii)
responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements,
representations or warranties made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any
obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Loan Party.

         9.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument,
writing, resolution,


<PAGE>


                                                                              86


notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may deem
and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes unless
such Note shall have been transferred in accordance with Section 10.6 and all
actions required by such Section in connection with such transfer shall have
been taken. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or
refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders
(or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it deems appropriate or
it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other
instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement), and such request and
any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all
the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

         9.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
hereunder unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender, the Parent or any Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". In the event that the Administrative Agent shall receive such a
notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders (or, if
so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other instructing group of
Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

         9.6 NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each Lender
expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
a Loan Party or any affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each
Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and


<PAGE>


                                                                              87


decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself
as to the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
the Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall have no duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates.

         9.7 INDEMNIFICATION. The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Parent or the
Primary Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Parent or the
Primary Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective Aggregate
Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought after the date upon which
the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid in
full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure Percentages immediately
prior to such date), for, and to save the Administrative Agent harmless from and
against, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever that may at any time (including, without limitation, at any time
following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the
Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by the
Administrative Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the
Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. The agreements in
this Section shall survive the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

         9.8 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. The Administrative
Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, hold equity
interests in and generally engage in any kind of business with any Loan Party or
its Affiliates as though the Administrative Agent were not an Administrative
Agent. With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any
Letter of Credit issued or participated in by it, the Administrative Agent shall
have the same rights and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an
Administrative Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the
Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.

         9.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent may resign
as Administrative Agent upon 15 days' notice to the Lenders and the Borrowers.
If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall appoint
from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent
shall (unless an Event of Default under Section 8(a) or Section 8(f) with
respect to the Primary Borrower shall have occurred and be continuing) be


<PAGE>


                                                                              88


subject to approval by the Primary Borrower (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such successor agent shall succeed
to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term
"Administrative Agent" shall mean such successor agent effective upon such
appointment and approval, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers
and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of
the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Loans. If no successor agent
has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the date that is 15 days
following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become
effective, and the Lenders shall assume and perform all of the duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor agent as provided for above. After the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of
this Section 9 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

         9.10 AUTHORIZATION TO RELEASE LIENS AND GUARANTEES. The Administrative
Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders to effect any
release of Liens or guarantee obligations contemplated by Section 10.15.

         9.11 THE ARRANGER, THE SYNDICATION AGENT AND THE DOCUMENTATION AGENTS.
The Arranger, the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agents, in their
respective capacities as such, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and
shall incur no liability, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.


                            SECTION 10 MISCELLANEOUS

         10.1 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. Neither this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or
modified except in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.1. The

(with the written consent of the Required Lenders) the Administrative Agent and
each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time, (a)
enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the

Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of the Loan
Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions as

                  (i) forgive or reduce the principal amount or extend the final
         scheduled date of maturity of any Loan or Reimbursement Obligation,
         extend the scheduled date of any amortization payment in respect of any
         Term Loan, reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable
         hereunder or extend the scheduled date of any payment thereof, or
         increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Commitment of
         any Lender, in each case without the consent of each Lender directly
         affected thereby;


<PAGE>


                                                                              89


                  (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section,
         reduce any percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders
         or Required Prepayment Lenders, amend, modify or waive the last
         sentence of the definition of Required Lenders, or otherwise amend or
         modify the definition of Required Lenders if the effect of such
         amendment or modification would be to eliminate reference in such
         definition to Loans and/or Commitments under any particular Facility,
         consent to the assignment or transfer by any Borrower of any of its
         rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan

         release the Parent or all or substantially all of the Subsidiary
         Guarantors from their guarantee obligations under the Guarantee and
         Collateral Agreement, in each case without the consent of all Lenders;

                  (iii) reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
         Majority Facility Lenders with respect to any Facility without the
         written consent of all Lenders under such Facility;

                  (iv) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 9 without
         the consent of the Administrative Agent;

                  (v) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.6 or 2.7
         without the written consent of the Swing Line Lender;

                  (vi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 2.18
         without the consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

                  (vii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 3
         without the consent of the Issuing Lender;

                  (viii) amend, modify or waive (x) any provision of Sections
         2.12 or 7.2(l) requiring by its terms the agreement of the Required
         Prepayment Lenders or (y) any other provision hereof if the effect is
         to subordinate one of the Facilities in right of payment to any other
         of the Facilities, in either case without the consent of the Required
         Prepayment Lenders; or

                  (ix) amend, modify or waive the provisions of the definition
         of Interest Period regarding nine or twelve month Interest Periods for
         Eurodollar Loans without the consent of each relevant Lender.

Any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification shall apply
equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the
Lenders, the Administrative Agent and all future holders of the Loans. In the
case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed
to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent
thereon. Any such waiver, amendment, supplement or modification shall be
effected by a written instrument signed by the parties required to sign pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section;


<PAGE>


                                                                              90


PROVIDED, that delivery of an executed signature page of any such instrument by
facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart thereof.

         For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement may be amended (or amended
and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and each Loan Party to each relevant Loan Document (x) to
add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the
extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued
interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Term Loans and Revolving
Extensions of Credit and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and
(y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any
determination of the Required Lenders, Required Prepayment Lenders and Majority
Revolving Facility Lenders.

PROVIDED that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Administrative Agent,

delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.
The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

         10.4 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations
and warranties made hereunder, in the other Loan Documents and in any document,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the

         10.5 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES. The Primary Borrower agrees (a) to pay or
reimburse the Administrative Agent for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the syndication and administration of
the Facilities (other than fees payable to syndicate members) and the
development, preparation and execution of, and any amendment, supplement or
modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation and
administration of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements and other charges of
counsel to the Administrative Agent and the charges of Intralinks, (b) to pay or
reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for all their costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any
rights under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other
documents, including, without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel
to each Lender and of counsel to the Administrative Agent, (c) to pay,
indemnify, or reimburse each Lender and the Administrative Agent for, and hold
each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless from, any and all recording
and filing fees and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from
any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, which may be payable
or determined to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or
consummation or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or
any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or
in respect of, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other
documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify or


<PAGE>


                                                                              92


reimburse each Lender, the Administrative Agent, its respective affiliates, and
their respective officers, directors, trustees, employees, advisors, agents and
controlling persons (each, an "Indemnitee") for, and hold each Indemnitee
harmless from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery,
enforcement, performance and administration of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and any such other documents, including, without limitation, any of
the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation of,
noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to the
operations of the Parent, any Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Properties and the fees and disbursements and other charges of legal counsel in
connection with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against any
Borrower hereunder (all the foregoing in this clause (d), collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"), provided, that the Primary Borrower shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and
nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. No
Indemnified Person shall be liable for use by unauthorized Persons of
information sent through electronic media. It is understood and agreed that, to
the extent not precluded by a conflict of interest (as reasonably determined by
the relevant Indemnitee), each Indemnitee shall endeavor to work cooperatively
with the Borrowers with a view towards minimizing the legal and other expenses
associated with any defense and any potential settlement or judgment. To the
extent reasonably practicable and not disadvantageous to any Indemnitee (as
reasonably determined by the relevant Indemnitee), it is anticipated that a
single counsel selected by the affected Lenders may be used. Without limiting
the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, each Borrower
agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby
waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to so waive, all rights for
contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims,
demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses
of whatever kind or nature with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement,
performance and administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and
any such other documents, under or related to Environmental Laws, that any of
them might have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee, except to the
extent such rights result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee. All amounts due under clauses (a), (b) and (c) of the first
sentence of this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days after written
demand therefor. Statements payable by the Primary Borrower pursuant to this
Section shall be submitted to Reid T. Campbell (Telephone No. (603) 640-2203)
(Fax No. (603) 643-4562), at the address of the Primary Borrower set forth in
Section 10.2, or to such other Person or address as may be hereafter designated
by the Primary Borrower in a written notice to the Administrative Agent. The
agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other
amounts payable hereunder.

         10.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parent, each
Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of the Loans
and their respective successors and assigns, except that neither Borrower may
not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender.

                                                                              93


         (b) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the
Administrative Agent (but with notice to the Administrative Agent), in
accordance with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more banks, financial
institutions or other entities (each, a "PARTICIPANT") participating interests
in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other
interest of such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the
event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant,
such Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible
for the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such
Loan for all purposes under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In no event shall
any Participant under any such participation have any right to approve any
amendment or waiver of any provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment,
waiver or consent would, pursuant to Section 10.1, require the consent of all
Lenders under any Facility in which such Participant has a participating
interest. Each Borrower agrees that if amounts owing by such Borrower under this
Agreement and the Loans are due or unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall
have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each
Participant shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed
to have the right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts
owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this
Agreement, PROVIDED that, in purchasing such participating interest, such
Participant shall be deemed to have agreed to share with the Lenders the
proceeds thereof as provided in Section 10.7(a) as fully as if such Participant
were a Lender hereunder. Each Borrower also agrees that each Participant shall
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.19, 2.20 and 2.21 with respect to its
participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time as
if such Participant were a Lender; PROVIDED that, in the case of Section 2.20,
such Participant shall have complied with the requirements of said Section, and
PROVIDED, FURTHER, that no Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater
amount pursuant to any such Section than the transferor Lender would have been
entitled to receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by
such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer occurred.

         (c) Any Lender (an "ASSIGNOR") may, in accordance with applicable law
and upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time and from time
to time assign to any Lender or any affiliate or Control Investment Affiliate
thereof or, with the consent of the Primary Borrower and the Administrative
Agent and, in the case of any assignment of Revolving Credit Commitments, the
written consent of the Issuing Lender and the Swing Line Lender (which, in each
case, shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) (PROVIDED that the consent
of the Primary Borrower need not be obtained with respect to (x) any assignment
by the Administrative Agent or by any Lehman Entity and (y) any assignment of
Term Loans), to an additional bank, financial institution or other entity (an
"ASSIGNEE") all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance, substantially in the form of Exhibit
E, executed by such Assignee and such Assignor (and, where the consent of the
Primary Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender or the Swing
Line Lender is required pursuant to the foregoing provisions, by the Primary
Borrower and such other Persons) and delivered to the Administrative Agent for
its acceptance and recording in the Register; PROVIDED

that (i) no such assignment of (x) Tranche A Term Loans or (y) Revolving Credit
Commitments and/or Revolving Credit Loans to an Assignee (other than any Lender
or any Control Investment Affiliate thereof) shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of less than $5,000,000 (other than in the case of an assignment of all
of a Lender's interests under this Agreement), (ii) no such assignment of (x)
Tranche A Term Loans or (y) Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Revolving Credit
Loans (other than in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender's interests
under this Agreement) shall result in such Lender's Commitments, together with
the Commitments of such Lender's Control Investment Affiliates, being reduced to
less than $5,000,000, (iii) no such assignment of Tranche B Term Loans to an
Assignee (other than any Lender or any Control Investment Affiliate thereof)
shall be in an aggregate principal amount of less than $1,000,000 (other than in
the case of an assignment of all of a Lender's interests under this Agreement),
and (iv) no such assignment of Tranche B Term Loans (other than in the case of
an assignment of all of a Lender's interests under this Agreement) shall result
in such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan Commitment (or, after the Closing Date,
Tranche B Term Loans), together with the Tranche B Term Loan Commitment (or,
after the Closing Date, Tranche B Term Loans) of such Lender's Control
Investment Affiliates, being reduced to less than $1,000,000 (but more than $0),
in each case unless otherwise agreed by the Primary Borrower and the
Administrative Agent. Any such assignment need not be ratable as among the
Facilities. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the effective date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
(x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder with Commitments and/or Loans as set forth therein, and (y) the
Assignor thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and
Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the
case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of an Assignor's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, such Assignor shall cease to be a party
hereto, except as to Section 2.19, 2.20, 10.5 and 10.14 in respect of the period
prior to such effective date). Notwithstanding any provision of this Section,
the consent of the Primary Borrower shall not be required for any assignment
that occurs at any time when any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing.

         (d) The Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the Borrowers,
maintain at its address referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Assignment
and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (the "REGISTER") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and
principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time to time. The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error,
and each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of the Loans and any
Notes evidencing such Loans recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement.
Any assignment of any Loan, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall be
effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the
Register (and each Note shall expressly so provide). Any assignment or transfer
of all or part of a Loan evidenced by a Note shall be registered on the Register
only upon surrender for registration of assignment or transfer of the Note
evidencing such Loan, accompanied by a duly executed Assignment and Acceptance;
thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be
issued to the designated Assignee, and the old Notes shall be returned by the
Administrative Agent to the relevant Borrower marked "canceled". The Register
shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any Lender (with

                                                                              95


respect to any entry relating to such Lender's Loans) at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

         (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
Assignor and an Assignee (and, in any case where the consent of any other Person
is required by Section 10.6(c), by each such other Person) together with payment
to the Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500
(except that (x) no such registration and processing fee shall be payable in the
case of an Assignee which is an affiliate of the Assignor or a Person under
common management with the Assignor and (y) only one registration and processing
fee shall be payable in cases of contemporaneous multiple assignments by an
Assignor to Assignees which are Control Investment Affiliates of each other),
the Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the
information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance
and recordation to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers. On or prior to
such effective date, the relevant Borrower, at its own expense, upon request,
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent (in exchange for the
Revolving Credit Note and/or applicable Term Notes, as the case may be, of the
assigning Lender) a new Revolving Credit Note and/or applicable Term Notes, as
the case may be, to the order of such Assignee in an amount equal to the
Revolving Credit Commitment and/or applicable Term Loans, as the case may be,
assumed or acquired by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the
Assignor has retained a Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Term Loans, as the
case may be, upon request, a new Revolving Credit Note and/or Term Notes, as the
case may be, to the order of the Assignor in an amount equal to the Revolving
Credit Commitment and/or applicable Term Loans, as the case may be, retained by
it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall
otherwise be in the form of the Note or Notes replaced thereby.

         (f) For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge
that the provisions of this Section concerning assignments of Loans and Notes
relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank
in accordance with applicable law.

         10.7 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF. (a) Except to the extent that this Agreement
provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the Lenders
under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a "Benefitted Lender") shall at any
time receive any payment of all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or
receive any collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily,
by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in
Section 8(f), or otherwise), in a greater proportion than any such payment to or
collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other
Lender's Obligations, such Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the
other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each such other
Lender's Obligations, or shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of
any such collateral, as shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the
Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or
benefits is thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest.

         (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by
law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Parent or any
Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Parent and each Borrower
to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and
payable by the Parent or any Borrower hereunder (whether at the stated maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise), to set off and appropriate and apply against such
amount any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final), in any currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any
currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent,
matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Lender or any branch or
agency thereof to or for the credit or the account of the Parent or such
Borrower, as the case may be. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made by such
Lender, PROVIDED that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application.

         10.8 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of the
parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement or of a
Lender Addendum by facsimile transmission shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this Agreement
signed by all the parties shall be lodged with each Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

         10.9 SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

         10.10 INTEGRATION. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the entire agreement of the Parent, each Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof, and there are no promises, undertakings, representations or
warranties by the Arranger, the Administrative Agent or any Lender relative to
subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the
other Loan Documents.

         10.11 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF
THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

         10.12 SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVERS. Each of the Parent and each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

                  (a) submits for itself and its Property in any legal action or
         proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
         which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment
         in respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general

         jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York, the courts of the
         United States of America for the Southern District of New York, and
         appellate courts from any thereof;

                  (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
         in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
         have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or
         that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and
         agrees not to plead or claim the same;

                  (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or
         proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
         certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
         prepaid, to the Parent or any Borrower, as the case may be, at its
         address set forth in Section 10.2 or at such other address of which the
         Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

                  (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
         effect service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall
         limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

                  (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any
         right it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding
         referred to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or
         consequential damages.

         10.13 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. Each of the Parent and each Borrower hereby

         execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

                  (b) neither the Arranger, the Administrative Agent nor any
         Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty to the Parent or any
         Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any of
         the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Arranger,
         the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on one hand, and the Parent
         and each Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or
         therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

                  (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan
         Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions
         contemplated hereby among the Arranger, the Administrative Agent and
         the Lenders or among the Parent any Borrower and the Lenders.

designated by such Loan Party as confidential; PROVIDED that nothing herein
shall prevent the Administrative Agent or any Lender from disclosing any such
information (a) to the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, any other Lender or

"TRANSFEREE") or prospective Transferee that expressly agrees to comply with

of its employees, directors, agents, attorneys, accountants and other
professional advisors, (d) to any financial institution that is a direct or
indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual

the provisions of this Section), (e) upon the request or demand of any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over it, (f) in response to any order
of any court or other Governmental Authority or as may otherwise be required
pursuant to any Requirement of Law, (g) in connection with any litigation or
similar proceeding, (h) that has been publicly disclosed other than in breach of
this Section, (i) to the NAIC or any similar organization or any nationally
recognized rating agency that requires access to information about a Lender's

         10.15 RELEASE OF COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
         or in any other Loan Document, upon request of the Primary Borrower in
         connection with any Disposition of Property permitted by the Loan
         Documents, the Administrative Agent shall (without notice to, or vote
         or consent of, any Lender, or any affiliate of any Lender that is a
         party to any Specified Hedge Agreement) take such actions as shall be
         required to release its security interest in any Collateral being
         Disposed of in such Disposition, and to release any guarantee
         obligations under any Loan Document of any Person being Disposed of in
         such Disposition, to the extent necessary to permit consummation of
         such Disposition in accordance with the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
         or any other Loan Document, when all obligations of the Borrowers
         hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (other than obligations in
         respect of any Specified Hedge Agreement) have been paid in full, all
         Commitments have terminated or expired and no Letter of Credit shall be
         outstanding, upon request of the Primary Borrower, the Administrative
         Agent shall (without notice to, or vote or consent of, any Lender, or
         any affiliate of any Lender that is a party to any Specified Hedge
         Agreement) take such actions as shall be required to release its
         security interest in all Collateral, and to release all guarantee
         obligations under any Loan Document, whether or not on the date of such
         release there may be outstanding obligations in respect of Specified
         Hedge Agreements. Any such release of guarantee obligations shall be
         deemed subject to the provision that such guarantee obligations shall
         be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment in
         respect of the obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or
         must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
         dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Borrower or any
         Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver,
         intervener or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any
         Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or
         otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

         10.16 ACCOUNTING CHANGES. In the event that any "Accounting Change" (as
defined below) shall occur and such change results in a change in the method of
calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms in this Agreement, then
the Primary Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree to enter into
negotiations in order to amend such provisions of this Agreement so as to
equitably reflect such Accounting Changes with the desired result that the
criteria for evaluating the Primary Borrower's financial condition shall be the
same after such Accounting Changes as if such Accounting Changes had not been
made. Until such time as such an amendment shall have been executed and
delivered by each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders,
all financial covenants, standards and terms in this Agreement shall continue to
be calculated or construed as if such Accounting Changes had not occurred.
"Accounting Changes" refers to changes in accounting principles required by the
promulgation of any rule, regulation, pronouncement or opinion by the Financial
Accounting Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, applicable Insurance Regulators, the NAIC or, if applicable, the
SEC.

party to this Agreement by delivering to the Administrative Agent a Lender
Addendum duly executed by such Lender, the Primary Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

         10.18 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARENT, EACH BORROWER, THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.
