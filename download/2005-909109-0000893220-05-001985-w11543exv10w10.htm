    <TD>In the event of the insolvency of one or more of the reinsured companies, this reinsurance
shall be payable directly to the company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or
statutory successor on the basis of the liability of the company without diminution because of
the insolvency of the company or because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory
successor of the company has failed to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed,
however, that the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the company
shall give written notice to the Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the company
indicating the policy or bond reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the
part of the Reinsurer within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation
or liquidation proceeding or in the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim,
the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding
where such claim is to be adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to
the company or its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor. The expense thus
incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against
the company as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata

undertaken by the Reinsurer.</TD>
