[Separately addressed to each of
  the Purchasers identified on Schedule A]

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         INVACARE CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation (together with its permitted
successors, the "Company"), hereby agrees with you as follows:

SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF NOTES.

         The Company will authorize the issue and sale of

                   (a) $50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 3.97%
         Series A Senior Notes due October 1, 2007 (the "Series A Notes");

                   (b) $30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.74%
         Series B Senior Notes due October 1, 2009 (the "Series B Notes"); and

                   (c) $20,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.05%
         Series C Senior Notes due October 1, 2010 (the "Series C Notes").

The term "Series A Notes" as used in this Agreement shall include each Series A
Note delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the Other Agreements (as
hereinafter defined) and any such notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant
to Section 14 of this Agreement or the Other Agreements, and the term "Series B
Notes" as used in this Agreement shall include each Series B Note delivered
pursuant to this Agreement and the Other Agreements and any such notes issued in
substitution therefor pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement or the Other
Agreements and the term "Series C Notes" as used in this Agreement shall include
each Series C Note delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the Other Agreements
(as hereinafter defined) and any such Notes issued in substitution therefor
pursuant to Section 14 of this Agreement or the Other Agreements. The term
"Notes" as used in this Agreement shall include each Series A Note, each Series
B Note and each Series C Note. The Series A Notes, the Series B Notes and the
Series C Notes shall be substantially in the forms set out in Exhibits 1A, 1B
and 1C, respectively, with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by

<page>
you, the Other Purchasers (as hereinafter defined) and the Company. Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Schedule B; references
to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise specified, to a Schedule
or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement.

SECTION 2. SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will
issue and sell to you and you will purchase from the Company, at the Closing
provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount and of the Series
specified below your name in Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of the
principal amount thereof. Contemporaneously with entering into this Agreement,
the Company is entering into separate Note Purchase Agreements (the "Other
Agreements") identical with this Agreement with each of the other purchasers
named in Schedule A (the "Other Purchasers"), providing for the sale at such
Closing to each of the Other Purchasers of Notes in the principal amount and of
the Series specified below its name in Schedule A. Your obligation hereunder and
the obligations of the Other Purchasers under the Other Agreements are several
and not joint obligations and you shall have no obligation under any Other
Agreement and no liability to any Person for the performance or non-performance
by any Other Purchaser thereunder.

SECTION 3. CLOSING.

         The sale and purchase of the Notes to be purchased by you and the Other
Purchasers shall occur at the offices of Chapman and Cutler LLP, at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, at a closing (the "Closing") on October 1, 2003 or on such other
Business Day thereafter as may be agreed upon by the Company and you and the
Other Purchasers. At the Closing the Company will deliver to you the Notes of
the Series to be purchased by you in the form of a single Note (or such greater
number of Notes in denominations of at least $500,000 as you may request), dated
the date of the Closing and registered in your name (or in the name of your
nominee), against delivery by you to the Company or its order of immediately
available funds in the amount of the purchase price therefor by wire transfer of
immediately available funds for the account of the Company as indicated on
Schedule C. If at the Closing the Company shall fail to tender such Notes to you
as provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in
Section 4 shall not have been fulfilled to your satisfaction, you shall, at your
election, be relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement, without
thereby waiving any rights you may have by reason of such failure or such
nonfulfillment.

SECTION 4. CONDITIONS TO CLOSING.

         Your obligation to purchase and pay for the Notes to be sold to you at
the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to your satisfaction, prior to or at
the Closing, of the following conditions:

         Section 4.1. Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Company in this Agreement shall be correct in all material
respects when made and at the time of the Closing.

                                       2

         Section 4.2. Performance; No Default. The Company shall have performed
and complied with all agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement
required to be performed or complied with by it prior to or at the Closing and,
after giving effect to the issue and sale of the Notes (and the application of
the proceeds thereof as contemplated by Schedule 5.14) no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary shall have entered into any transaction since the date of the
Memorandum that would have been prohibited by Sections 11.1 through 11.3 or
Sections 11.5 through 11.8 had such Sections applied since such date and, with
respect to Section 11.4, a Subsidiary shall be able to borrow at least One
Dollar of Debt under said Section 11.4 as of the date of Closing.

         Section 4.3.    Compliance Certificates.

         (a) Officer's Certificates. The Company shall have delivered to you an

         Section 4.4. Opinions of Counsel. You shall have received opinions in
form and substance satisfactory to you, dated the date of the Closing,

                   (a) from Bridget Miller, Esq., General Counsel of the

         covering such other matters incident to the transactions contemplated
         hereby as you or your counsel may reasonably request (and the Company
         hereby instructs its counsel to deliver such opinion to you),

                   (b) from Calfee, Halter & Griswold LLP, special counsel for
         the Company, substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 4.4(b) and
         covering such other matters incident to the transactions contemplated
         hereby as you or your counsel may reasonably request (and the Company
         hereby instructs its counsel to deliver such opinion to you),

                   (c) from Harter, Secrest & Emery LLP, Special New York

         contemplated hereby as you or your counsel may reasonably request (and
         the Company hereby instructs its counsel to deliver such opinion to
         you), and

                   (d) from Chapman and Cutler LLP, your special counsel in
         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

         Section 4.5. Purchase Permitted by Applicable Law, Etc. On the date of
the Closing your purchase of Notes shall (a) be permitted by the laws and
regulations of each jurisdiction to which you are subject, without recourse to

                                       3
<page>
provisions (such as section 1405(a)(8) of the New York Insurance Law) permitting
limited investments by insurance companies without restriction as to the
character of the particular investment, (b) not violate any applicable law or
regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation U, T or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System) and (c) not subject you to any tax,
penalty or liability under or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation,
which law or regulation was not in effect on the date of your execution and
delivery of this Agreement. If requested by you, you shall have received an
Officer's Certificate certifying as to such matters of fact as you may
reasonably specify to enable you to determine whether such purchase is so
permitted.

Commissioners) shall have been obtained for each Series of the Notes.

         Section 4.9. Changes in Structure. Except as specified in Schedule 4.9,
the Company shall not have changed its jurisdiction of incorporation or been a
party to any merger or consolidation and shall not have succeeded to all or any
substantial part of the liabilities of any other entity, at any time following
the date of the most recent financial statements referred to in Schedule 5.5.

        Section 4.10. Amendment to Credit Agreement. The Company shall have
entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement clarifying the obligations of
the Subsidiaries which are parties thereto in form and substance satisfactory to
you and your special counsel.

        Section 4.11. Proceedings and Documents. All corporate and other
proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and all documents and instruments incident to such transactions shall be
satisfactory to you and your special counsel, and you and your special counsel
shall have received all such counterpart originals or certified or other copies
of such documents as you or they may reasonably request.

SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

         The Company represents and warrants to you, as of the date of this
Agreement, that:

                                       4
<page>
         Section 5.1. Organization; Power and Authority. The Company is a
corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has the corporate power and authority to own or hold under lease the properties
it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts
and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Other
Agreements and the Notes and to perform the provisions hereof and thereof.

         Section 5.2. Authorization, Etc. This Agreement, the Other Agreements
and the Notes have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of the Company, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon execution and
delivery thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law or in respect of specific performance).

         Section 5.3. Disclosure. (a) The Company, through its agent, Banc One
Capital Markets, Inc., has delivered to you and each Other Purchaser a copy of a
Confidential Private Placement Memorandum, dated August 2003 (the "Memorandum"),
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly
describes, in all material respects, the general nature of the business and
principal properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in
Schedule 5.3, this Agreement, the Memorandum, the documents, certificates or
other writings delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and the financial statements listed in
Schedule 5.5, taken as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein (taken as a whole) not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in the Memorandum
or as expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the documents,
certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the financial
statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2002, there has been no
change in the financial condition, operations, business, properties or prospects
of the Company and its Subsidiaries except changes that individually or in the
aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
There is no fact known to a Senior Financial Officer that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or
in the Memorandum or in the other documents, certificates and other writings
delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company specifically for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that no
representation is made as to general economic conditions.

         (b) The material assumptions used in the preparation of the projected
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries included in the
Memorandum, taken as a whole, were made in good faith, were believed to be

                                       5
<page>
reasonable when made and the Company believes such assumptions continue to be
reasonable. All material assumptions and principles of accounting on which such
projections were based are disclosed therein. Such projections were prepared in
good faith, have a reasonable basis and represent the good faith opinion of the
Company as to the projected results of the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The
estimates of future performance and financial condition set forth in such
projections, taken as a whole, are, in the Company's opinion, reasonable;
however, actual events or results may differ materially from such estimates.
There is no fact known to a Senior Financial Officer that has occurred since the
preparation of such projections that could materially affect such projections,
except such facts that the Memorandum or other written statements delivered to
you disclose have occurred or may occur.

         Section 5.4. Organization and Ownership of Shares of Subsidiaries;
Affiliates. (a) Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
correct lists (i) of the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary,
the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization and the
percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock or similar equity
interests outstanding owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary, (ii) of
the Company's Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries, and (iii) of the Company's
directors and senior officers.

         (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien
(except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).

         (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (to the
extent such concept is recognized) under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal
entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification
is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be
so qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary
has the corporate or other power and authority to own or hold under lease the
properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to transact the business
it transacts and proposes to transact.

         (d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any legal
restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the agreements listed
on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate law statutes)
restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to pay dividends out of profits or
make any other similar distributions of profits to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
interests of such Subsidiary.

         Section 5.5. Financial Statements. The Company has delivered to you and
each Other Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its
Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said financial statements (including
in each case the related schedules and notes) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates specified in such Schedule and the

                                       6
<page>
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the respective
periods so specified and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto
(subject, in the case of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end
adjustments).

         Section 5.6. Compliance with Laws, Other Instruments, Etc. The
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
Notes will not:

                   (a) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a
         default under, or result in the creation of any Lien in respect of any
         property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any indenture,
         mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease,
         corporate charter, bylaws or other constitutive document, or any other
         agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound
         or by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
         properties may be bound or affected,

                   (b) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
         conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of
         any court, arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to the
         Company or any Subsidiary, or

                   (c) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or
         regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or
         any Subsidiary.

         Section 5.7. Governmental Authorizations, Etc. No consent, approval or
authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental
Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
by the Company of this Agreement or the Notes, except for the filing in the
ordinary course of a copy of this Agreement in connection with the filing by the
Company of its Form 8K.

         Section 5.8. Litigation; Observance of Agreements, Statutes and Orders.
(a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits or
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
affecting the Company or any Subsidiary or any property of the Company or any
Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default under any term
of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound,
or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or
Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule
or regulation (including, without limitation, Environmental Laws) of any
Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         Section 5.9. Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all tax
returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction, and have paid
all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns and all other taxes and
assessments levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or franchises,

                                       7
<page>
to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before
they have become delinquent, except for any taxes and assessments (a) the amount
of which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (b) the amount,
applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which the Company or any Subsidiary,
as the case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP.
The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or assessment that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The charges, accruals
and reserves on the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of
federal, state or other taxes for all fiscal periods are adequate. The federal
income tax liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been determined
by the Internal Revenue Service and paid for all fiscal years up to and
including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002.

        Section 5.10. Title to Property; Leases. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and sufficient title to their respective properties that
individually or in the aggregate are Material, including all such properties
reflected in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or
purported to have been acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary after said date
(except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in
each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that
individually or (with respect to similar groups of assets) in the aggregate are
Material are valid and subsisting and are in full force and effect in all
material respects.

        Section 5.11. Licenses, Permits, Etc. Except as disclosed in Schedule
5.11:

                   (a) to the best knowledge of the Company, the Company and its
         Subsidiaries own or possess all licenses, permits, franchises,
         authorizations, patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks and
         trade names, or rights thereto, that are Material, without known
         conflict with the rights of others;

                   (b) to the best knowledge of the Company, no product or
         practice of the Company or any Subsidiary infringes in any material
         respect any license, permit, franchise, authorization, patent,
         copyright, service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned by
         any other Person; and

                   (c) to the best knowledge of the Company, there is no
         Material violation by any Person of any right of the Company or any
         Subsidiary with respect to any patent, copyright, service mark,
         trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by the Company or
         any of its Subsidiaries.

        Section 5.12. Pension Plans. (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate
have operated and administered each Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) in
compliance with all applicable laws except for such instances of noncompliance
as have not resulted in and could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any liability in the nature of a penalty, excise tax or fine pursuant
to Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the Code
relating to employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3 of ERISA), and no
event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that could reasonably be
expected to result in the incurrence of any such liability by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of any Lien on any of the rights,

                                       8
<page>
properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, in either case
pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or excise tax provisions
or to section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the Code, other than such liabilities or
Liens as would not be individually or in the aggregate Material.

         (b) The present value of the aggregate benefit liabilities under each
of the Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than Multiemployer Plans),
determined as of the end of each such Plan's most recently ended plan year on
the basis of the actuarial assumptions specified for funding purposes in such
Plan's most recent actuarial valuation report, did not exceed the aggregate
current value of the assets of such Plan allocable to such benefit liabilities
by more than $10,000,000 in the case of any single Plan and by more than
$10,000,000 in the aggregate for all Plans. The term "benefit liabilities" has
the meaning specified in section 4001 of ERISA and the terms "current value" and
"present value" have the meaning specified in section 3 of ERISA.

         (c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred withdrawal
liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal liabilities) under
section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of Multiemployer Plans that
individually or in the aggregate are Material.

         (d) The unfunded expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined
as of the last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without
regard to liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section
4980B of the Code) of the Company and its Subsidiaries is not Material.

         (e) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance and
sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any transaction that is subject to
the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could
be imposed pursuant to section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation
by the Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance
upon and subject to the accuracy of your representation in Section 6.2 as to the
sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased
by you.

         (f) All Non-US Pension Plans have been established, operated,
administered and maintained in material compliance with all laws, regulations
and orders applicable thereto, except where any failure to so comply could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except where they could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, all premiums,
contributions and any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to applicable
Non-US Pension Plan documents or applicable laws governing such Non-US Pension
Plans have been paid or accrued as required.

        (g) The Multiemployer Plans in respect of which the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate makes contributions or has any liability or obligation are set forth
on Schedule 5.12(g). The Plans constituting "defined benefit plans" (as defined
in section (3)(35) of ERISA) are set forth on Schedule 5.12(g).

                                       9
<page>
        Section 5.13. Private Offering by the Company. Neither the Company nor
anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes or any similar securities for
sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the same from, or otherwise
approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any Person other than you, the
Other Purchasers and not more than 53 other Institutional Investors, each of
which has been offered the Notes at a private sale for investment. Neither the
Company nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or will take, any action that
would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to the registration requirements
of section 5 of the Securities Act.

        Section 5.14. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. The Company will
apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as set forth in Schedule 5.14. No
part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used, directly
or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock within the
meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any
securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a violation of
Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a
violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not
constitute more than 5% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the Company does not have any present intention that
margin stock will constitute more than 5% of the value of such assets. As used
in this Section, the terms "margin stock" and "purpose of buying or carrying"
shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.

        Section 5.15. Existing Debt; Future Liens. (a) Except as described
therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding
Material Debt of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2003, since
which date there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates,
sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Material Debt of the
Company and its Subsidiaries except as described in Schedule 5.15. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default and no waiver of default is
currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest on any Material
Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary and no event or condition exists with
respect to any Material Debt of the Company or such Subsidiary that would permit
(or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more
Persons to cause such Debt to become due and payable before its stated maturity
or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.

         (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the
happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned
or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 11.6.

        Section 5.16. Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Etc. Neither the sale
of the Notes by the Obligors hereunder nor their use of the proceeds thereof
will violate (i) the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, (ii) any of the
foreign assets control regulations of the United States Treasury Department (31
CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling legislation or executive
order relating thereto, (iii) Executive Order 13224, 66 Fed Reg 49, 079 (2001),
issued by the President of the United States (Executive Order Blocking Property
and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to Commit, or
Support Terrorism) (and neither Obligor nor any Subsidiary is a "blocked person"
as described in Section 1 of such Executive Order or engages in any dealings or

                                       10
<page>
transactions with or is otherwise associated with, any such blocked person) or
(iv) the United and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot Act) Act of 2001,
Public Law 107-56 (October 26, 2001).

        Section 5.17. Status under Certain Statutes. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, the ICC
Termination Act of 1995, as amended, or the Federal Power Act, as amended.

        Section 5.18. Environmental Matters. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim or has received any notice of any claim,
and no proceeding has been instituted raising any claim against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective real properties now or
formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or other assets, alleging any
damage to the environment or violation of any Environmental Laws, except, in
each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as otherwise disclosed to you in writing:

                   (a) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has knowledge of
         any facts which would give rise to any claim, public or private, of
         violation of Environmental Laws or damage to the environment emanating
         from, occurring on or in any way related to real properties now or
         formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them or to other assets or
         their use, except, in each case, such as could not reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                   (b) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         stored any Hazardous Materials on real properties now or formerly
         owned, leased or operated by any of them in a manner contrary to any
         Environmental Laws and has not transported or disposed of any Hazardous
         Materials in a manner contrary to any Environmental Laws in each case
         in any manner that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect; and

                   (c) all buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or
         operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in compliance
         with applicable Environmental Laws, except where failure to comply
         could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
         Effect.

SECTION 6.           REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASER.

         Section 6.1. Purchase for Investment. You represent that you are an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities
Act and that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account or for one or
more separate accounts maintained by you or for the account of one or more
pension or trust funds (or commingled pension trust funds) or for the account of
one or more "accredited investors" within the meaning of Regulation D under the
Securities Act for whom you are acting as investment manager, agent or
investment adviser, and not with a view to the distribution thereof, provided
that the disposition of your or their property shall at all times be within your
or their control. You understand that the Notes have not been registered and are

                                       11
<page>
"restricted securities" under the Securities Act. You further understand that
the Notes may be resold only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the
Securities Act or if an exemption from registration is available, except under
circumstances where neither such registration nor such an exemption is required
by law, and that the Company is not required to and does not intend to register
the Notes.

         Section 6.2. Source of Funds. You represent that at least one of the
following statements is an accurate representation as to each source of funds (a
"Source") to be used by you to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be
purchased by you hereunder:

                   (a) the Source is an "insurance company general account" as
         defined in Department of Labor Prohibited Transaction Exemption ("PTE")
         95-60 (60 FR 35925, July 12, 1995) and in respect thereof you represent
         that there is no "employee benefit plan" (as defined in section 3(3) of
         ERISA and section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, treating as a single plan all
         plans maintained by the same employer or employee organization or
         affiliate thereof) with respect to which the amount of the general
         account reserves and liabilities of all contracts held by or on behalf
         of such plan exceed 10% of the total reserves and liabilities of such
         general account (exclusive of separate account liabilities) plus
         surplus, as set forth in the NAIC Annual Statement filed with your
         state of domicile; or

                   (b) if you are an insurance company, the Source does not
         include assets allocated to any separate account maintained by you in
         which any employee benefit plan (or its related trust) has any
         interest, other than a separate account that is maintained solely in
         connection with your fixed contractual obligations under which the
         amounts payable, or credited, to such plan and to any participant or
         beneficiary of such plan (including any annuitant) are not affected in
         any manner by the investment performance of the separate account; or

                   (c) the Source is either (i) an insurance company pooled
         separate account, within the meaning of PTE 90-1 (issued January 29,
         1990), or (ii) a bank collective investment fund, within the meaning of
         the PTE 91-38 (issued July 12, 1991) and, except as you have disclosed
         to the Company in writing pursuant to this paragraph (c), no employee
         benefit plan or group of plans maintained by the same employer,
         affiliate of such employer or employee organization beneficially owns
         more than 10% of all assets allocated to such pooled separate account
         or collective investment fund; or

                   (d) (i) the Source constitutes assets of an "investment fund"
         (within the meaning of Part V of the QPAM Exemption) managed by a
         "qualified professional asset manager" or "QPAM" (within the meaning of
         Part V of the QPAM Exemption), (ii) no employee benefit plan's assets
         that are included in such investment fund, when combined with the
         assets of all other employee benefit plans established or maintained by
         the same employer or by an affiliate (within the meaning of Section
         V(c)(1) of the QPAM Exemption) of such employer or by the same employee
         organization and managed by such QPAM, exceed 20% of the total client
         assets managed by such QPAM, (iii) the conditions of Part I(c) and (g)
         of the QPAM Exemption are satisfied, neither the QPAM nor a person

                                       12
<page>
         controlling or controlled by the QPAM (applying the definition of

         have disclosed the existence during such period of any condition or
         event that constitutes a Default or an Event of Default or, if any such
         condition or event existed or exists (including, without limitation,
         any such event or condition resulting from the failure of the Company
         or any Subsidiary to comply with any Environmental Law), specifying the

         at the expense of the Company to visit and inspect any of the offices
         or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary, to examine all their
         respective books of account, records, reports and other papers, to make
         copies and extracts therefrom, and to discuss their respective affairs,

         public accountants (and by this provision the Company authorizes said
         accountants to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the
         Company and its Subsidiaries), all at such reasonable times and as
         often as may be reasonably requested.

SECTION 8. PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

         Section 8.1. Required Prepayments.

         (a) Series A Notes. There shall be no scheduled principal prepayments
on account of the Series A Notes. The unpaid principal amount of each Series A
Note, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on
October 1, 2007.

                                       16
<page>
         (b) Series B Notes. There shall be no scheduled principal prepayments
on account of the Series B Notes. The unpaid principal amount of each Series B
Note, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on
October 1, 2009.

         (c) Series C Notes. There shall be no scheduled principal prepayments
on account of the Series C Notes. The unpaid principal amount of each Series C
Note, together with accrued unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable on
October 1, 2010.

         Section 8.2. Optional Prepayments of Notes with Make-Whole Amount. The
Company may, at its option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at any time
all, or from time to time any part of, either Series of Notes, on a pro rata
basis in respect of all Notes of such Series outstanding at such time, in an
amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such
Series then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the
principal amount so prepaid and accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment, plus the Make-Whole Amount determined for the prepayment date with
respect to the principal amount of Notes being so prepaid. The Company will give
each holder of Notes of such Series to be prepaid under this Section 8.2 written
notice of such optional prepayment not less than 30 days and not more than 60
days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment (which shall be a Business
Day). Each such notice shall specify such date, the aggregate principal amount
and the Series of the Notes to be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of
each Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with
Section 8.3), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to
such principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate
of a Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated Make-Whole Amount due in
connection with such prepayment (calculated as if the date of such notice were
the date of the prepayment), setting forth the details of such computation. Two
Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each holder
of a Note to be optionally prepaid under this Section 8.2 a certificate of a
Senior Financial Officer specifying the calculation of the Make-Whole Amount in
respect of such Notes as of the specified prepayment date. For the purposes of
avoidance of doubt, the Company may effect multiple partial prepayments of the
Notes pursuant to, and in accordance with the terms of, this Section 8.2.

         Section 8.3. Allocation of Note Partial Prepayments. In the case of
each partial prepayment of either Series of Notes pursuant to Section 8.2, the
principal amount of the Notes of the Series to be prepaid shall be allocated
among all of the Notes of such Series at the time outstanding in proportion, as
nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts thereof not
theretofore called for prepayment. All partial prepayments made pursuant to any
Debt Offered Prepayment Application or pursuant to Section 8.6 with respect to a
Change in Control shall be applied only to the Notes of the holders who have
elected to participate in such prepayment.

         Section 8.4. Notes; Maturity; Surrender, Etc. In the case of each
prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each
such Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date
fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount
accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and
after such date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when
so due and payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as

                                       17
<page>
aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note
paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and
shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid
principal amount of any Note.

         Any Debt Offered Prepayment Application in respect of the Notes shall
be on terms as set forth in Section 8.2 (other than any requirement in said
Section requiring a minimum prepayment amount or any requirement in said Section
that is inconsistent with a requirement in this Section 8.4) and this Section
8.4, provided that only those holders who shall have accepted any offer in
respect of such Debt Offered Prepayment Application shall have their Notes
prepaid, in whole or part, in connection therewith. Each notice of a Debt
Offered Prepayment Application made to the holders of Notes shall be in writing,
shall be executed by a Senior Financial Officer, shall reasonably identify the
property being Transferred, the portion of the Net Proceeds Amount in respect of
such Transferred property being utilized in connection with such Debt Offered
Prepayment Application and all other Senior Debt being made subject to such Debt
Offered Prepayment Application, shall calculate the Ratable Portion in respect
of each holder of Notes with respect to such Net Proceeds Amount and shall
specify the date on which such Debt Offered Prepayment Application will be
effected, which date will be not less than 35 days and not more than 90 days
after the date of notice. To accept or reject a Debt Offered Prepayment
Application, a holder of Notes shall cause a written notice of such acceptance
or rejection to be delivered to the Company not later than 30 days after the
date on which such notice is delivered to such holder. A failure by any holder
of Notes to respond in writing to a notice of a Debt Offered Prepayment
Application by the deadline set forth above shall be deemed to constitute an
acceptance of the same. If a Debt Offered Prepayment Application is accepted or
is deemed to have been accepted, the amounts payable in respect thereof shall
become due and payable on the date set therefor in the notice in respect
thereof.

         Any prepayment of Notes in respect of a Change in Control under Section
8.6 shall be on terms as set forth in said Section 8.6, provided that only those
holders who shall have accepted the offer under said Section 8.6 shall have
their Notes prepaid in whole in connection therewith.

         Section 8.5. Purchase of Notes. The Company will not and will not
permit any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly
or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment or
prepayment of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Notes (including, without limitation, any prepayment of the Notes contemplated
in connection with a Debt Offered Prepayment Application or a Change in Control
accepted by any holder of Notes). The Company will promptly cancel all Notes
acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or purchase
of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may be issued
in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

         Section 8.6.    Offer to Prepay upon Change in Control, Etc.

         (a) Notice and Offer. In the event of either (i) a Change in Control,
or (ii) the obtaining of actual knowledge of a Control Event by a Senior
Financial Officer, the Company will, within five Business Days of the occurrence
of either of such events, give written notice of such Change in Control or
Control Event to each holder of Notes by facsimile transmission and,

                                       18
<page>
simultaneously with the sending of such facsimile notice, send a copy of such
notice to each such holder via an overnight courier of national reputation. Such
written notice shall contain, and such written notice shall constitute, an
irrevocable offer to prepay all, but not less than all, the Notes held by such
holder on a date specified in such notice (the "Control Prepayment Date") that
is not less than 60 days and not more than 90 days after the date of such
notice, provided that, in the case of a Control Event that does not give rise to
a Change in Control, such notice shall be null and void and in the case of a
Control Event that does give rise to a Change in Control which shall occur more
than 90 days following the date the written notice required by this Section
8.6(a) must be given, the Control Prepayment Date may be delayed by the Company
to a date not later than the date on which the Change in Control arising from
such Control Event shall actually be consummated or finalized. If the Control
Prepayment Date shall not be specified in such notice, the Control Prepayment
Date shall be the 60th day after the date of such notice; it being understood by
the parties hereto, for purposes of the avoidance of doubt, that any such notice
shall be dated the date on which it is first given to the holders of Notes and
that all notices to all holders of Notes shall bear the same date.

         If the Company shall not have received a written response to such
written notice from any holder of Notes within 10 days after the date of the
facsimile transmission of such notice to such holder, the Company shall use its
best efforts to send a second written notice via an overnight courier of
national reputation to such holder of Notes but shall be under no obligation to
do so.

         (b) Acceptance and Payment; Rejection.

                   (i) Acceptance and Payment. To accept or reject such offered
         prepayment, a holder of Notes shall cause a notice of such acceptance
         or rejection to be delivered to the Company not later than 30 days
         after the date of the notice constituting such offered prepayment
         (which, if there shall have been two written notices, shall be deemed
         to be the first written notice). If so accepted, such offered
         prepayment in respect of such principal amount of such Notes shall be
         due and payable on the Control Prepayment Date. Such offered prepayment
         shall be made at 100% of the principal amount of the Notes held by
         holders having accepted such offer, together with interest on the Notes
         then being prepaid accrued to the Control Prepayment Date, if any.

                  (ii) Rejection. A failure by any holder of Notes to respond in
         writing to all written offers of prepayment referred to in Section
         8.6(b) by the deadlines set forth therein shall be deemed to constitute
         a rejection of such offer by such holder.

         (c) Officer's Certificate. Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant to
this Section 8.6 shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a Senior
Financial Officer and dated the date of such offer, specifying:

                   (i)     the Control Prepayment Date;

                                       19
<page>
                  (ii) that such offer is being made pursuant to this Section
         8.6 and that failure by a holder to respond to such offer by the
         deadlines as established by this Section 8.6 shall result in such offer


                 (iii) the interest that would be due on each such Note offered
         to be prepaid, accrued to the date fixed for payment;

                  (iv) that the conditions of this Section 8.6 have been
         fulfilled; and

                   (v) in reasonable detail, a description of the nature and
         date or proposed date of the Change in Control.

         (d)    Cancellation  of Notes.  Any Note  acquired by the Company
         under this Section 8.6 shall be cancelled  and shall not be reissued.

         Section 8.7. Make-Whole Amount. The term "Make-Whole Amount" means,
with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Discounted Value with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the
amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no
event be less than zero. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and you agree
that the determination of Reinvestment Yield and Remaining Average Life in
respect of Notes of each Series will be different and will result in different
Make-Whole Amounts in respect of the Notes of each Series.

         For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following
terms have the following meanings:

                  "Called Principal" means, with respect to any Note, the
         principal of such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or
         has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to
         Section 13.1, as the context requires.

                  "Discounted Value" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting the amount of such
         Called Principal and interest payable in respect thereof from, in the
         case of the Called Principal, the maturity date in respect of such Note
         to the Settlement Date and, in the case of such interest, the scheduled
         dates of payment hereunder in respect thereof to the Settlement Date,
         in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor
         (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on such
         Note is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such
         Called Principal.

                  "Reinvestment Yield" means, with respect to the Called
         Principal of any Note, the sum of (a) 0.50% per annum plus (b) the
         yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported, as of 10:00 a.m.
         (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the
         Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display
         designated as "Page U.S.D." of the Bloomberg Financial Markets Services
         Screen (or, if not available, any other nationally recognized trading
         screen reporting on-line intraday trading in the U.S. Treasury
         securities) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a

                                       20
<page>
         maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal
         as of such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such yields are not reported as
         of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not
         ascertainable (including by interpolation), the Treasury Constant
         Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such
         yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding
         the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal
         Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor
         publication) for actively traded U.S. Treasury securities having a
         constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called
         Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be
         determined, if necessary, by (1) converting U.S. Treasury bill
         quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted
         financial practice and (2) interpolating linearly between (A) the
         actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and
         greater than the Remaining Average Life and (B) the actively traded
         U.S. Treasury security with the maturity closest to and less than the
         Remaining Average Life.

                  "Remaining Average Life" means, with respect to the Called
         Principal of any Note, the number of years (calculated to the nearest
         one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with
         respect to such Called Principal and the maturity date of the Note in
         respect thereof.

                  "Settlement Date" means, with respect to the Called Principal
         of any Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid
         pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately
         due and payable pursuant to Section 13.1, as the context requires.

Environmental Laws, and will obtain and maintain in effect all licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations
necessary to the ownership of their respective properties or to the conduct of
their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary to ensure that
non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations
or failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses, certificates,
permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

        Section 10.2. Insurance. The Company will and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers,
insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against
such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such

provided by captive insurance companies, if adequate reserves are maintained
with respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established
reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.

        Section 10.3. Maintenance of Properties. The Company will and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and
kept, their respective properties in good repair, working order and condition
(other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in

Section shall not prevent the Company or any Subsidiary from discontinuing the
operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is
desirable in the conduct of its business and the Company has concluded that such
discontinuance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 10.4. Payment of Taxes and Claims. The Company will and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to file all tax returns required to be filed in
any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable

payable that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company

                                       22

or any Subsidiary (including, without limitation, mechanic's liens or other
similar construction liens), provided that neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment or claims if (a) the amount,
applicability or validity thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary
on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Company
or such Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefore in accordance
with GAAP on the books of the Company or such Subsidiary or (b) the nonpayment
of all such taxes and assessments and claims in the aggregate could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate existence. Subject to
Section 11.2 and Section 11.7, the Company will at all times preserve and keep

Subsidiaries (unless merged into the Company or a Subsidiary) and all rights and
franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless, in the good faith
judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve and keep in
full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise could not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

        Section 10.6. Pari Passu Obligations. The Company covenants that its
obligations under the Notes and under this Agreement and the Other Agreements do
and will rank at least pari passu in right of payment with all of its present
and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, except for those

        Section 11.2. Merger, Consolidation, Etc. The Company will not and will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to consolidate, amalgamate or merge with or

profits therefrom or assign or otherwise convey any right to receive such income
or profits (unless it makes, or causes to be made, effective provision whereby
the Notes will be equally and ratably secured with any and all other obligations
thereby secured, such security to be pursuant to an agreement reasonably
satisfactory to the Required Holders providing for such security (including an
opinion of counsel to the Company to the effect that the holders of the Notes
are so equally and ratably secured) and, in any such case, the Notes shall have
the benefit, to the fullest extent that, and with such priority as, the holders

         ordinary conduct of the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole, provided that such charges and encumbrances do not,
         in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of such property;

         Subsidiary, which Liens shall extend solely to such receivables, the
         proceeds in respect thereof, receivables substituted therefor and books
         or records in respect thereof, provided that such Transfer is an
         arm's-length transaction, not accounted for under GAAP as a secured

                  terms of the instrument originally creating such Lien, other
                  property (or improvement thereon) which is an improvement to
                  or is acquired for specific use in connection with such
                  acquired or constructed property (or improvement thereon) or

                  thereon) at the time of such acquisition or construction,

                          (iii) any such Lien shall be created contemporaneously
                  with, or within 180 days after, the acquisition or

                           (iv) at the time of creation, incurrence, assumption
                  or guarantee of the Debt secured by such Lien and after giving

<page>
                            (i) no such Lien shall have been created or assumed

                  or items of property so acquired and proceeds thereof and, if
                  required by the terms of the instrument originally creating
                  such Lien, other property which is an improvement to or is
                  acquired for specific use in connection with such acquired
                  property,

                  such Lien shall at no time exceed an amount equal to the Fair
                  Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Board of
                  Directors of the Company) of such property (or improvement
                  thereon) at the time of such consolidation, merger, becoming a

                  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than property
                  already encumbered by the existing Lien being so renewed or
                  replaced,

                           (ii) the principal amount of the underlying
                  obligation secured by such existing Lien outstanding at the

                  connection with such renewal or replacement and the average

        Section 11.8. Sale of Assets, Etc. The Company will not and will not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to make any Transfer, provided that the foregoing
restriction does not apply to a Transfer if:

                   (a) the property that is the subject of such Transfer
         constitutes either (i) inventory or (ii) equipment, fixtures, supplies
         or materials no longer required in the operation of the business of the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that is obsolete, and, in each
         case, such Transfer is in the ordinary course of business;

                   (b) such Transfer is (i) from a Subsidiary to the Company or
         a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary or (ii) from the Company to a Wholly-Owned
         Subsidiary, in each case, so long as immediately before and after
         giving effect to the consummation of any such Transfer, no Default or
         Event of Default would exist;

                   (c) such Transfer is subject to Section 11.2 and satisfies
         the requirements thereof;

                   (d) such Transfer is of receivables of ICC (or any other
         Subsidiary primarily responsible for providing credit to the customers
         of the Company and its Subsidiaries), whether with or without recourse
         to ICC, the Company or any other Subsidiary, provided that such
         Transfer is an arm's-length transaction, not accounted for under GAAP
         as a secured loan and, in the good-faith opinion of a Senior Financial
         Officer, for fair value and in the best interests of the Company and
         the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and provided, further, that
         recourse to ICC, the Company or any other Subsidiary in connection with
         any such Transfer shall be limited to (i) liabilities arising from the
         breach of warranties made by ICC or such other Subsidiary in connection
         with any such Transfer and (ii) an amount, with respect to any such
         Transfer and in addition to clause (i) above, not in excess of 30% of
         the proceeds of the disposition of the receivables so transferred in
         such Transfer;

                   (e) such Transfer involves only receivables owned by the
         Company or a Subsidiary being transferred to a Special Purpose
         Subsidiary for fair market value pursuant to the Permitted Receivables
         Securitization Program; or

                   (f) such Transfer is not a Transfer described in clause (a)
         through clause (d) above (each such Transfer is referred to as a
         "Basket Transfer"), and all of the following conditions shall have been
         satisfied with respect to such Transfer:

                            (i) in the good faith opinion of the Board of
                  Directors of the Company, the Transfer is in exchange for
                  consideration with a Fair Market Value at least equal to that
                  of the property exchanged, and is in the best interests of the
                  Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,

                           (ii) immediately before and after giving effect to
                  such transaction no Default or Event of Default would exist,
                  and

                                       29
<page>
                          (iii) immediately after giving effect to such
                  Transfer, the book value of all property (including the
                  property that was the subject of such Transfer) that was the
                  subject of each Basket Transfer occurring during the current
                  Fiscal Year would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets
                  determined as of the end of the then most recently ended
                  Fiscal Year.

                  If the Net Proceeds Amount for any Basket Transfer is applied
         to a Debt Offered Prepayment Application and/or is applied to, or
         committed in writing to, a Property Reinvestment Application, in each
         case within 365 days after the consummation of such Transfer (and, in
         the case of any such commitment, such Property Reinvestment Application
         is actually consummated within 30 days after the expiration of such
         365-day period), then such Basket Transfer, to the extent of such
         application or applications of such Net Proceeds Amount, shall be
         excluded from any calculations set forth above in subclause (iii) of
         this clause (e).

         For purposes of determining the book value of any property that is the
subject of a Transfer, such book value shall be the book value of such property,
as determined in accordance with GAAP, at the time of the consummation of such
Transfer, provided that, in the case of a Transfer of any capital stock or other
equity interests of a Subsidiary, the book value thereof shall be deemed to be
an amount equal to

                   (A) the remainder (determined after eliminating all
         intra-company transactions, assets and liabilities in accordance with
         GAAP) of

                            (1) the book value of the total net assets of such
                                Subsidiary less

                            (2) the liabilities of such Subsidiary times

                   (B) a percentage that is equal to the percentage of total
         equity interests of such Subsidiary attributable to the capital stock
         or other equity interest being so Transferred.

        Section 11.9. Line of Business. The Company will not and will not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any business if, as a result, the general
nature of the business in which the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, would then be engaged would be substantially changed from the general
nature of the business in which the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, are engaged on the date of the Closing as described in the Memorandum.

As used in Section 12(j), the terms "employee benefit plan" and "employee
welfare benefit plan" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms

SECTION 13. REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

        Section 13.1. Acceleration. (a) If an Event of Default with respect to
the Company described in paragraph (g) or paragraph (h) of Section 12 (other
than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of paragraph (g) or described
in clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of the fact that such clause
encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has occurred, all the Notes then
outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

         (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any
holder or holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Notes at the time
outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by notice or notices to the
Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and
payable.

         (c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of
Section 12 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes at the
time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or
their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held by
it or them to be immediately due and payable.

                                       33
<page>
         Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 13.1,
whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and
the entire unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of
such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall
all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment,
demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. The Company
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in such Note free from repayment by the Company
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that such Note is prepaid or
is accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

        Section 13.2. Other Remedies. If any Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or
have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 13.1, the holder of
any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights
of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained
herein or in any Note, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the
terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby
or thereby or by law or otherwise.

        Section 13.3. Rescission. At any time after any Notes have been declared
due and payable pursuant to clause (b) or clause (c) of Section 13.1, the
holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by
written notice to the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and
its consequences if (a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes,
all principal due and payable on any Notes other than by reason of such
declaration, and all interest on such overdue principal, if any, and any
Make-Whole Amount that is due and payable in respect of the Notes other than by
reason of such declaration and any interest thereon and (to the extent permitted
by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the
applicable Default Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than
non-payment of amounts that have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, have been cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 18, and (c)
no judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due
pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No rescission and annulment under this Section
13.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.

        Section 13.4. No Waivers or Election of Remedies, Expenses, Etc. No
course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in
exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall
be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein
or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.
Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 16, the Company
will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover all reasonable costs and expenses of such holder incurred in

SECTION 14. REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

        Section 14.1. Registration of Notes. The Company shall keep at its
principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of
transfers of Notes. The name and address of each holder of one or more Notes,
each transfer thereof and the name and address of each transferee of one or more
Notes shall be registered in such register. Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered
shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes
hereof, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge to the
contrary. The Company shall give to any holder of a Note that is an
Institutional Investor promptly upon request therefor, a complete and correct
copy of the names and addresses of all registered holders of Notes.

        Section 14.2. Transfer and Exchange of Notes. Upon surrender of any Note
at the principal executive office of the Company for registration of transfer or
exchange (and in the case of a surrender for registration of transfer, duly
endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the
registered holder of such Note or his attorney duly authorized in writing and
accompanied by the address for notices of each transferee of such Note or part
thereof), the Company shall execute and deliver, at the Company's expense
(except as provided below), one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder
thereof) in exchange therefor, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
unpaid principal amount of the surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be
payable to such Person as such holder may request and shall be substantially in
the form of Exhibit 1A or Exhibit 1 B. Each such new Note shall be dated and
bear interest from the date to which interest shall have been paid on the
surrendered Note or dated the date of the surrendered Note if no interest shall
have been paid thereon. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such
transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be transferred in denominations of less than
$1,000,000, provided that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by
a holder of its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of
less than $1,000,000. Any transferee, by its acceptance of a Note registered in
its name (or the name of its nominee), shall be deemed to have made the
representation set forth in Section 6.2.

        Section 14.3. Replacement of Notes. Upon receipt by the Company of
evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of and the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Note (which evidence shall be, in the case of
an Institutional Investor, notice from such Institutional Investor of such
ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and

                   (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
         reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note
         is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a
         Note with a minimum net worth of at least $250,000,000, such Person's
         own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be
         satisfactory), or

                   (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and
cancellation thereof,

                                       35
<page>
the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new
Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have been
paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid
thereon.

 SECTION 15. PAYMENTS ON NOTES.

        Section 15.1. Place of Payment. Subject to Section 15.2, payments of
principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest becoming due and payable on
the Notes shall be made in Elyria, Ohio at the principal office of the Company
in such jurisdiction. The Company may at any time, by notice to each holder of a
Note, change the place of payment of the Notes so long as such place of payment
shall be either the principal office of the Company in the United States of
America or the principal office of a bank or trust company in the United States
of America.

        Section 15.2. Home Office Payment. So long as you or your nominee shall
be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in Section
15.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums becoming due
on such Note for principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the
method and at the address specified for such purpose below your name in Schedule
A, or by such other method or at such other address as you shall have from time
to time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the
presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon,
except that upon written request of the Company made concurrently with or
reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, you shall
surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after any such
request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the place of
payment most recently designated by the Company pursuant to Section 15.1. Prior
to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by you or your nominee you
will, at your election, either endorse thereon the amount of principal paid
thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid thereon or surrender
such Note to the Company in exchange for a new Note or Notes pursuant to Section
14.2. The Company will afford the benefits of this Section 15.2 to any
Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect transferee of any Note
purchased by you under this Agreement and that has made the same agreement
relating to such Note as you have made in this Section 15.2.

SECTION 16.       EXPENSES, ETC.

        Section 16.1. Transaction Expenses. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Company will pay all reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees of a special counsel and, if
reasonably required, local or other counsel) incurred by you and each Other
Purchaser or holder of a Note in connection with such transactions and in
connection with any amendments, waivers or consents under or in respect of this
Agreement or the Notes (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes
effective), including, without limitation: (a) the reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in enforcing or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or
defend) any rights under this Agreement or the Notes or in responding to any
subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in
connection with this Agreement or the Notes, or by reason of being a holder of
any Note, and (b) the reasonable costs and expenses, including financial

                                       36
<page>
advisors' fees, incurred in connection with the insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Company or any Subsidiary or in connection with any work-out or restructuring of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The Company will pay, and
will save you and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in
respect of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers and finders (other
than those retained by you).

        Section 16.2. Survival. The obligations of the Company under this
Section 16 will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement,
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes and the
termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 17. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

         All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes, the purchase or transfer
by you of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment of any
Note, and may be relied upon by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of
any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of you or any other holder of
a Note. All statements contained in any certificate or other instrument
delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Agreement shall be
deemed representations and warranties of the Company under this Agreement.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the Notes embody the
entire agreement and understanding between you and the Company and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

SECTION 18. AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

        Section 18.1. Requirements. This Agreement and the Notes may be amended,
and the observance of any term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either
retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the
Company and the Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any
of the provisions of any of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 22, or any defined
term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to you unless consented to by
you in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the written
consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding affected thereby, (i)
subject to the provisions of Section 13 relating to acceleration or rescission,
change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal of, or
reduce the rate or change the time of payment or method of computation of
interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage
of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8,
12(a), 12(b), 13, 18 and 21.

        Section 18.2. Solicitation of Holders of Notes.

         (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes
(irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient
information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is required, to
enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision with respect to
any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of the provisions
hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true and correct
copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the provisions

                                       37
<page>
of this Section 18 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the
date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or
approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

         (b) Payment. The Company will not directly or indirectly pay or cause
to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional
interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of Notes as
consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any holder of
Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions hereof
unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is concurrently
granted, on the same terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding
even if such holder did not consent to such waiver or amendment.

        Section 18.3. Binding Effect, Etc. Any amendment or waiver consented to
as provided in this Section 18 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is
binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Company
without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment
or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation,
covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived
or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the Company
and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or
under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such
Note. As used herein, the term "this Agreement" and references thereto shall
mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

        Section 18.4. Notes Held by Company, Etc. Solely for the purpose of
determining whether the holders of the requisite percentage of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved or consented to any
amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this Agreement or the Notes, or
have directed the taking of any action provided herein or in the Notes to be
taken upon the direction of the holders of a specified percentage of the
aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, Notes directly or
indirectly owned by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to
be outstanding.

SECTION 19. NOTICES.

         All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing and sent (a) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a
confirming copy of such notice by a recognized overnight delivery service
(charges prepaid), or (b) by registered or certified mail with return receipt
requested (postage prepaid), or (c) by a recognized overnight delivery service
(with charges prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:

                   (i) if to you or your nominee, to you or it at the address
         specified for such communications in Schedule A, or at such other
         address as you or it shall have specified to the Company in writing,

                  (ii) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at
         such address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company
         in writing, or

                                       38
<page>
                 (iii) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set
         forth at the beginning hereof to the attention of Chief Financial
         Officer, or at such other address as the Company shall have specified
         to the holder of each Note in writing.

Notices under this Section 19 will be deemed given only when actually received.

SECTION 20. REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

         This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without
limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by you at the Closing (except the Notes
themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other information
previously or hereafter furnished to you, may be reproduced by you by any
photographic, photostatic, microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic or other
similar process and you may destroy any original document so reproduced. The
Company agrees and stipulates that, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
any such reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in
any judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by you in the regular
course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of
such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 20
shall not prohibit the Company or any other holder of Notes from contesting any
such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from
introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

SECTION 21. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

         For the purposes of this Section 21, "Confidential Information" means
information delivered to you by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly
marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by you as
being confidential information of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, provided
that such term does not include information that

                   (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to you prior to the
                       time of such disclosure,

                   (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or
                       omission by you or any Person acting on your behalf,

                   (c) otherwise becomes known to you other than through
                       disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or

                   (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to you under
                       Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available.

                                       39
<page>
You will maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in
accordance with procedures adopted by you in good faith to protect confidential
information of third parties delivered to you, provided that you may deliver or
disclose Confidential Information to:

                   (i) your directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents,
         attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably
         relates to the administration of the investment represented by your
         Notes),

                  (ii) your financial advisors and other professional advisors
         who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information
         substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 21,

                 (iii) any other holder of any Note other than a Competitor,

                  (iv) any Institutional Investor to which you sell or offer to
         sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if
         such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such
         Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section
         21),

                   (v) any Person other than a Competitor from which you offer
         to purchase any security of the Company (if such Person has agreed in
         writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be
         bound by the provisions of this Section 21),

                  (vi) any federal or state regulatory authority having
         jurisdiction over you,

                 (vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or
         any similar organization, or any nationally recognized rating agency
         that requires access to information about your investment portfolio, or

                (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or disclosure may
         be necessary or appropriate:

                            (A) to effect compliance with any law, rule,
         regulation or order applicable to you,

                            (B) in response to any subpoena or other legal
         process,

                            (C) in connection with any litigation to which you
                  are a party, or

                            (D) if an Event of Default has occurred and is
                  continuing, to the extent you may reasonably determine such
                  delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the
                  enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies
                  under your Notes and this Agreement.

Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have
agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 21 as
though it were a party to this Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company

                                       40
<page>
in connection with the delivery to any holder of a Note of information required
to be delivered to such holder under this Agreement or requested by such holder
(other than a holder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee), such
holder will enter into an agreement with the Company embodying the provisions of
this Section 21. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in
any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties hereto
are parties or by which they are bound, the parties acknowledge and agree that
(i) any obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein do not apply
and have not applied from the commencement of discussions between the parties to
the tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction (and any related
transactions or arrangements), and (ii) each party (and each of its employees,
representatives, or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided to such party relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, all
within the meaning of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4.

SECTION 22. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

         You shall have the right to substitute any one of your Affiliates as
the purchaser of the Notes that you have agreed to purchase hereunder, by
written notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by both you and such
Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this
Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy
with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Upon receipt
of such notice, wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in
this Section 22), such word shall be deemed to refer to such Affiliate in lieu
of you. In the event that such Affiliate is so substituted as a purchaser
hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter transfers to you all of the Notes then
held by such Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer,
wherever the word "you" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section
22), such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall
refer to you, and you shall have all the rights of an original holder of the
Notes under this Agreement.

SECTION 23. ADDITIONAL NOTE PROVISIONS.

         Subject to the terms and provisions hereof (including, but not limited
to, Section 11.3), the Company may, from time to time, issue and sell additional
promissory notes pursuant to agreements which may incorporate by reference all
or certain of the provisions of this Agreement and the Other Agreements. Such
incorporation by reference shall not have the effect of constituting such
promissory notes as Notes for any purpose, whether for acceleration of the
Notes, rescission of such acceleration, or the exercise of any other amendments
or waivers of the provisions hereof or of the Other Agreements, or otherwise.

SECTION 24. MISCELLANEOUS.

        Section 24.1. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and other agreements
contained in this Agreement by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto bind

                                       41
<page>
and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns (including,
without limitation, any subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or
not.

        Section 24.2. Payments Due on Non-Business Days. Anything in this
Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding, any payment of principal
of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any Note that is due on a date other than
a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day without
including the additional days elapsed in the computation of the interest payable
on such next succeeding Business Day.

        Section 24.3. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law)
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

        Section 24.4. Construction. Each covenant contained herein shall be
construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of
each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant
shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse
compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action
to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such
provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or
indirectly by such Person.

        Section 24.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of
copies hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the
parties hereto.

        Section 24.6. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND
ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK EXCLUDING CHOICE-OF-LAW PRINCIPLES OF THE LAW
OF SUCH STATE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION
OTHER THAN SUCH STATE.

         Re:                                    Invacare Corporation


 Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Reference is made to the separate Note Purchase Agreements, each dated
as of October 1, 2003 (collectively, the "Note Purchase Agreements"), between
Invacare Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and each of the
purchasers listed on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreements (the
"Purchasers"), which provide for the issuance and sale by the Company of (a) its
3.97% Series A Senior Notes, due October 1, 2007 in the aggregate principal
amount of $50,000,000 (the "Series A Notes"), (b) its 4.74% Series B Senior
Notes, due October 1, 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of $30,000,000 (the
"Series B Notes") and (c) its 5.05% Series C Senior Notes, due October 1, 2010
in the aggregate principal amount of $20,000,000 (the "Series C Notes"; the
Series A Notes together with the Series B Notes and the Series C Notes are
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Notes"). The capitalized terms used
herein and not defined herein have the meanings specified in the Note Purchase
Agreements.

         I am the General Counsel to the Company and have represented it in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreements.
This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Section 4.4(a) of the Note Purchase
Agreements. In acting as the General Counsel to the Company, I have examined:

                   (a) the Note Purchase Agreements;

                   (b) the Series A Notes dated the date hereof, in the form of
         Exhibit 1A to the Note Purchase Agreements and registered in the names
         and in the principal amounts set forth on Schedule A to the Note
         Purchase Agreements;

                   (c) the Series B Notes dated the date hereof, in the form of
         Exhibit 1B to the Note Purchase Agreements and registered in the names
         and in the principal amounts set forth on Schedule A to the Note
         Purchase Agreements;

                   (d) the Series C Notes dated the date hereof, in the form of
         Exhibit 1C to the Note Purchase Agreements and registered in the names
         and in the principal amounts set forth on Schedule A to the Note
         Purchase Agreements;
<page>
                   (e) the articles of incorporation and code of regulations of
         the Company, as in effect on the date hereof;

                   (f) a good standing certificate from the State of Ohio, the
         state of incorporation of the Company, and foreign good standing
         certificates for the Company from each of the states set forth on Annex
         2 hereto;

                   (g) a letter, dated the date hereof, to ______________, the
         Company, certain other persons and me from Banc One Capital Markets,
         Inc., regarding the manner of the offering of the Notes (the "Offeree
         Letter"); and

                   (h) originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to
         my satisfaction, of such other documents, records, instruments and
         certificates of public officials or officers of the Company as I have
         deemed necessary or appropriate to enable me to render this opinion.

         In rendering my opinion, I have relied, to the extent I deem necessary
and proper, on:

                   (a) warranties and representations as to certain factual
matters contained in the Note Purchase Agreements; and

                   (b)     the Offeree Letter.

I have no actual personal knowledge of any material inaccuracies in any of the
facts contained in the documents listed in item (a) or item (b).

         The opinions which follow are subject to the following assumptions,
limitations and qualifications:

                   (a) I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, other
         than signatures of the Company, the authenticity of all documents
         submitted to me as originals, and the conformity with the original
         documents of all documents submitted to me as reproduced copies, and
         the authenticity of all such latter documents.

                   (b) I have assumed (to the extent relevant to the opinions
         expressed herein) the organization, existence, good standing and
         capacity of all persons and entities other than the Company and that
         such persons and entities, other than the Company, have the right,
         power and authority to execute and deliver the Note Purchase Agreements
         and to perform thereunder.

                                   E4.4(a)-4
<page>
                   (c) I have assumed (to the extent relevant to the opinions
         expressed herein) that the Purchasers' obligations under the Note
         Purchase Agreements are within the powers of the Purchasers and that
         the Note Purchase Agreements have (if and to the extent required) been
         duly executed and validly delivered by the Purchasers.

                   (d) As to various questions of fact material to this opinion,
         I have made such factual inquiries of the Company, and have examined
         such other documents and made such examinations of applicable laws, as
         I have deemed necessary for purposes of the opinions expressed herein.
         However, where I state that a matter is to the best of my knowledge, I
         have, to the extent that such matter is not known to my personal
         knowledge, and, after reasonable investigation on my part, relied upon
         the written statements of the Company and the officers of the Company
         (as the case may be), with no inquiry as to the facts other than as
         necessary to establish that such reliance was reasonable on my part. In
         all such instances of reliance by me, I have no reason to believe that
         the factual matters assumed by me are not true and correct.

         My opinion is based upon the laws of the State of Ohio and the United
States of America.

         Based on the foregoing, I am of the following opinions:

                    1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio.

                    2. The Company is duly qualified as a foreign corporation
         and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which such
         qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions as to
         which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not,
         individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                    3. Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
         incorporation and is duly licensed or qualified and is in good standing
         in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or
         leased by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
         licensing or qualification necessary, other than those jurisdictions as
         to which the failure to be in good standing or so licensed or qualified
         could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect, and all of the issued and outstanding
         shares of capital stock of each such Subsidiary have been duly issued,
         are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by the Company, by one
         or more Subsidiaries, or by the Company and one or more Subsidiaries.

                    4. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8 to the Note Purchase
         Agreements, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to
         the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, threatened against or
         affecting the Company, any property of the Company, any Subsidiary or
         any property of any Subsidiary in any court or before any arbitrator of
         any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority that, individually
         or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                    5. The Company has the requisite corporate power and
         authority to execute and deliver the Note Purchase Agreements, to issue
         and sell the Notes, and to perform its obligations set forth in each of
         the Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes.

                                    E4.4(a)-5
<page>
                    6. Each of the Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes has
         been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
         the Company (no action of stockholders of the Company being required)
         and has been executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer of the
         Company.

                    7. The execution and delivery of the Note Purchase
         Agreements by the Company, the execution, issuance, sale and delivery
         of the Notes by the Company and the performance by the Company of its
         obligations thereunder do not conflict with, constitute a violation of,
         result in a breach of any provision of, constitute a default under with
         or without notice, or lapse of time, or both, or result in the creation
         or imposition of any Lien or encumbrance upon any of its properties
         pursuant to the articles of incorporation or code of regulations of the
         Company, any applicable statute, rule or regulation of the State of
         Ohio or the United States of America to which the Company is subject,
         or any agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by
         which its property may be bound.

                    8. No consents, approvals or authorizations of Ohio
         Governmental Authorities are required on the part of the Company in
         connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the Note
         Purchase Agreements and the Notes.

                    9. Under existing law, the registration of the Notes under
         the "blue sky" laws of the State of Ohio is not required in connection
         with the offering, issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes by the
         Company under the circumstances contemplated by the Note Purchase
         Agreements.

                   10. If the Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes were
         governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, they would constitute a
         legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against
         the Company in accordance with their terms.

         Each of the opinions set forth above is subject to the following
qualifications, assumptions, limitations and exceptions:

                   11. Any opinion contained herein with respect to the
         enforceability of the Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes is
         qualified to the extent that:

                            (a) the enforceability of the Note Purchase
                  Agreements and the Notes is subject to the effect of general
                  principles of equity, including, without limitation, concepts
                  of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing
                  and the possible unavailability of specific performance or
                  injunctive relief regardless of whether considered in a
                  proceeding in equity or at law; and

                            (b) the enforceability of certain terms provided in
                  the Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes may be limited by

                  in effect.

          [FORM OF CLOSING OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL FOR THE COMPANY]


                    [LETTERHEAD OF COMPANY'S SPECIAL COUNSEL]

                                                                  [Closing Date]

To each of the Persons
  listed on Annex 1 hereto


         Re:                                    Invacare Corporation


 Ladies and Gentlemen:

         Reference is made to the separate Note Purchase Agreements, each dated
as of October 1, 2003 (collectively, the "Note Purchase Agreements"), between
Invacare Corporation, an Ohio corporation, and each of the purchasers listed on
Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreements (the "Purchasers"), which provide for
the issuance and sale by the Company of (a) its 3.97% Series A Senior Notes due
October 1, 2007 in the aggregate principal amount of $50,000,000, (b) its 4.74%
Series B Senior Notes due October 1, 2009 in the aggregate principal amount of
$30,000,000 and (c) its 5.05% Series C Senior Notes due October 1, 2010 in the
aggregate principal amount of $20,000,000. The capitalized terms used herein and
not defined herein have the meanings specified in the Note Purchase Agreements.

         We have acted as special New York counsel to the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreements. This opinion
is being delivered pursuant to Section 4.4(b) of the Note Purchase Agreements.

         In acting as such counsel, we have examined:

                   (a) the Note Purchase Agreements;

                   (b) the Company's 3.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 1,
         2007, dated the date hereof, in the form of Exhibit 1A to the Note
         Purchase Agreements and registered in the names and in the principal
         amounts set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreements (the
         "Series A Notes");

                   (c) the Company's 4.74% Series B Senior Notes due October 1,
         2009, dated the date hereof, in the form of Exhibit 1B to the Note
         Purchase Agreements and registered in the names and in the principal
         amounts set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreements (the
         "Series B Notes,");

                   (d) the Company's 5.05% Series C Senior Notes due October 1,
         2010, dated the date hereof, in the form of Exhibit 1C to the Note
         Purchase Agreements and registered in the names and in the principal
<page>
         amounts set forth on Schedule A to the Note Purchase Agreements (the
         "Series C Notes" and together with the Series A Notes and Series B
         Notes the "Notes");
                   (e) certain documents executed and delivered by the Company
         in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase
         Agreements, including, without limitation, the certificates of certain
         officers of the Company delivered pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Note
         Purchase Agreements and the documents attached thereto;

                   (f) letters, dated the date hereof, to __________________,
         certain other Persons and the Company from Banc One Capital Markets,
         Inc., regarding the manner of the offering of the Notes (the "Offeree
         Letters");

                   (g) the opinion of ________________, General Counsel of the
         Company, dated the date hereof, delivered to you pursuant to Section
         4.4(a) of the Note Purchase Agreements; and

                   (h) originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to
         our satisfaction, of such other documents, records, instruments and
         certificates of public officials as we have deemed necessary or
         appropriate to enable us to render this opinion.

         In rendering our opinion, we have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures and documents submitted to us as originals, that all copies submitted
to us conform to the originals, the legal capacity of all natural Persons, and
that each Person executing documents had the power to enter into and perform its
obligations under such documents, and that such documents have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by such Persons.

         In rendering our opinion, we have relied, to the extent we deem
necessary and proper, on:

                   (A) warranties and representations as to certain factual
         matters contained in the Note Purchase Agreements;

                   (B) the Offeree Letters; and

                   (C) the aforesaid opinion of ____________________ with
         respect to all matters (i) governed by the laws of the State of Ohio
         and (ii) concerning the due incorporation and corporate power and
         authority of, and the authorization, execution and delivery of
         documents by, the Company; based on such investigation as we have
         deemed appropriate, such opinion is satisfactory in form and scope to
         us, it being understood in connection with the foregoing statement that
         we have not reviewed, nor do we hold ourselves out as having knowledge
         of, the laws of the State of Ohio, and that such investigation into the
         matters covered by such opinion was not sufficient to enable us
         independently to render opinions on such matters; nothing, however, has
         come to our attention that has caused us to question the legal
         conclusions expressed in such opinion and in our opinion the Purchasers
         and we are justified in relying thereon.

                                EXHIBIT 4.4(b)-2
<page>
         Based on the foregoing, we are of the following opinions:

                    1. Each of the Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes
         constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company
         enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

                    2. No consents, approvals or authorizations of Governmental
         Authorities in respect of the Company are required under the laws of
         the United States of America or the State of New York in connection
         with the execution and delivery by the Company of each of the Note
         Purchase Agreements and the Notes and the offer, issuance, sale and
         delivery by the Company of the Notes. Our opinion in this paragraph 2
         is based solely on a review of generally applicable laws of the United
         States of America and New York, and not on any search with respect to,
         or review of, any orders, decrees, judgments or other determinations
         specifically applicable to the Company.

                    3. Under existing law, neither the registration of the Notes
         under the Securities Act or the "blue sky" laws of the State of New
         York, nor the qualification of an indenture with respect thereto under
         the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, is required in connection
         with the offering, issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes by the
         Company on the date hereof under the circumstances contemplated by the
         Note Purchase Agreements.

                    4. Neither the issuance of the Notes nor the use of the
         proceeds thereof (as set forth in Section 5.14 of the Note Purchase
         Agreements) will violate Regulation G, T, U or X of the Federal Reserve
         Board.

                    5. The Company is not:

                            (a) an "investment company" or controlled by an
                  "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
                  Company Act of 1940, as amended, or

                            (b) a "holding company" or an "affiliate" of a
                  "holding company," or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
                  company," or a "public utility" within the meaning of the
                  Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

         All opinions contained herein with respect to the enforceability of the
Note Purchase Agreements and the Notes are qualified to the extent that:

                   (a) the availability of equitable remedies, including,
         without limitation, specific enforcement and injunctive relief, is
         subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings
         therefor may be brought; and

                   (b) the enforceability of certain terms provided in the Note
         Purchase Agreements and the Notes may be limited by applicable

                                EXHIBIT 4.4(b)-3
<page>
         bankruptcy, administration, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency,
         fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
         enforcement of creditors' rights generally as at the time in effect.

         We express no opinion as to the law of any jurisdiction other than the
law of the State of New York and the federal law of the United States of
America.

         Future holders of the Notes and Chapman and Cutler LLP may rely on this
opinion as if it were addressed to them. This opinion speaks only as of the date
hereof.

                                Very truly yours,
