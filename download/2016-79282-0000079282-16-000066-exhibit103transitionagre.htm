LYDECKER, a resident of the State of Florida (&#8220;Executive&#8221;). The Company and&#13;&#10; Executive are each a &#8220;Party&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;Parties.&#8221;&#13;&#10; BACKGROUND&#13;&#10; In connection with Executive&#8217;s voluntary resignation from the Company in July 2016&#13;&#10; (&#8220;Resignation&#8221;), the Company and the Executive wish to memorialize their agreement concerning&#13;&#10; Executive&#8217;s remaining period of employment with the Company, and with respect to the period following&#13;&#10; Executive&#8217;s departure from the Company. In recognition of Executive&#8217;s career with the Company, and as&#13;&#10; consideration for Executive&#8217;s agreement to abide by certain post-resignation obligations as set forth in this&#13;&#10; Agreement following Executive&#8217;s departure from the Company, the Company desires to provide Executive&#13;&#10; the consideration described in this Agreement in return for the agreements of the Executive set forth herein.&#13;&#10; The date upon which Executive&#8217;s Resignation from the Company is effective shall be described herein as&#13;&#10; the &#8220;Resignation Date.&#8221;&#13;&#10; The Company, on behalf of itself, its shareholders and its employees, has a compelling interest in&#13;&#10; maintaining the confidentiality of Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets (as such terms are defined&#13;&#10; in Section 5(a) of this Agreement), retaining its employees, and maintaining the customer relationships and&#13;&#10; business goodwill the Company develops and acquires. By virtue of Executive&#8217;s position, Executive has&#13;&#10; been afforded extensive and intimate knowledge of the Company&#8217;s strategic goals, including particularized&#13;&#10; plans and processes developed by the Company, whether through the Executive&#8217;s efforts or otherwise,&#13;&#10; which are not known to others in the industry and which give the Company and its Subsidiaries competitive&#13;&#10; advantage. In addition, Executive has had full access to information concerning the performance and results&#13;&#10; of various leaders, business units, divisions, profit centers and Subsidiaries of the Company and information&#13;&#10; related to the development and execution of strategic plans, including potential acquisitions, for the&#13;&#10; Company and/or its Subsidiaries. Executive&#8217;s role has been such that the Company&#8217;s Confidential&#13;&#10; Information and Trade Secrets have necessarily become inextricably entwined with Executive&#8217;s own&#13;&#10; knowledge and experience.&#13;&#10; NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:&#13;&#10; TERMS&#13;&#10; 1. The Executive&#8217;s Resignation and Future Relationship.&#13;&#10; (a) The Executive&#8217;s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall end as&#13;&#10; of the close of business on July 1, 2016, which shall also be deemed to be the Resignation Date. Pursuant&#13;&#10; to a Consulting Agreement in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit &#8220;A&#8221; (the&#13;&#10; &#8220;Consulting Agreement&#8221;), the Executive agrees that, after the Resignation Date, he will make himself&#13;&#10; available to the Company at reasonable times and locations to fulfill his duties under the Consulting&#13;&#10; Agreement. The level of services that the Executive provides after the Resignation Date shall in no event&#13;&#10; exceed 20 percent of the average level of services performed by the Executive for the Company during the&#13;&#10; 36-month period immediately preceding the Resignation Date and, except as set forth in the Consulting&#13;&#10; Agreement, shall not extend beyond twelve (12) months following the Resignation Date. Therefore, the&#13;&#10; services performed by the Executive after the Resignation Date shall not exceed the level of services&#13;&#10; permitted under Treasury Regulation &#167;1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii) under which the Executive is presumed to have&#13;&#10; had a &#8220;separation from service&#8221; (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;</FONT></DIV>

The&#13;&#10; Parties agree that neither will discuss or divulge any such information to any person other than Executive&#8217;s&#13;&#10; or Company&#8217;s own attorneys or accountants, without the prior written consent of the other, unless ordered&#13;&#10; to do so by a court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that, if they receive&#13;&#10; an inquiry from any media representative about the other or Company&#8217;s current or former officers, director&#13;&#10; or employees, his employment by the Company or the end of that employment, the parties will not respond&#13;&#10; but will immediately contact the other to inform the other of the media inquiry.

Executive also&#13;&#10; agrees to sign and deliver to the Company on the Resignation Date a formal letter of resignation in the form&#13;&#10; attached to this Agreement as Exhibit &#8220;B.&#8221;&#13;&#10; 2.

Executive understands and agrees that without such protection, the Company&#8217;s business&#13;&#10; would be irreparably harmed.&#13;&#10; (iv) It is the intention of the Parties that the terms and provisions of this&#13;&#10; Agreement be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. To that end, the Parties&#13;&#10; agree that if a court should declare any of the covenants in this Section 5 unenforceable, the court shall be&#13;&#10; authorized to modify or &#8220;blue pencil&#8221; the covenants to the extent necessary to cure any legal impediment&#13;&#10; to enforcement.&#13;&#10; (v) This Agreement does not relieve the Executive of other legal&#13;&#10; responsibilities and liabilities that Executive has to the Company under applicable state and federal statutes&#13;&#10; and common law.

The Parties acknowledge that it would&#13;&#10; be impossible to monitor or enforce this covenant as to Company&#8217;s entire employee base of over 7,800&#13;&#10; employees. In order to preserve the spirit and intent of the covenant, the Parties agree that this covenant&#13;&#10; shall apply solely to the present and future composition of the Company&#8217;s Leadership Council.
