Tranche E Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if any Tranche E Lender has in fact
defaulted in making its share of such Tranche E Term Loan Borrowing, then the applicable Tranche E Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such defaulted amount (to the extent so advanced by the
Administrative Agent on behalf of such defaulting Tranche E Lender), together with interest on such amount at the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans from the Restatement Effective Date to the date of payment. Upon any such payment by the
Borrower, the Borrower shall have the right, at the defaulting Tranche E Lender&#146;s expense, upon notice to the defaulting Tranche E Lender and to the Administrative Agent, to require such defaulting Tranche E Lender to transfer and assign
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04 of the Restated Credit Agreement) all its interests, rights and obligations as a Tranche E Lender under the Restated Credit Agreement to another financial
