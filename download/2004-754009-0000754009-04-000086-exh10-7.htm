<P ALIGN="CENTER">COVENANTS</P>


</B><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1&nbsp;<U>Annual Reporting</U>.  Within sixty days following December&nbsp;31 of each calendar year prior to January&nbsp;1, 2009 (such December&nbsp;31, in each case, a &quot;<U>Report Date</U>&quot;), the Purchaser will deliver to the Seller a written statement (an &quot;<U>Annual Reserve Report</U>&quot;) in a format to be reasonably agreed by the parties, accompanied by a standard actuarial report, setting forth in reasonably specific detail, including all supporting calculations and schedules, the Developed Experience at the particular Report Date.  The first Report Date shall be December 31, 2004.  The Annual Reserve Report shall be based on SAP and generally accepted actuarial principles and on the underlying data of the Company and the Subsidiaries (as if on a consolidated, stand-alone basis) used to report reserves in the Statutory Statements as of the Report Date.  </p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2&nbsp;<U>Final Reserve Report</U>.  The Purchaser shall cause the Company or any other entity which is the successor or surviving corporation of the Company to prepare a report in reasonably specific detail, including supporting calculations (the &quot;<U>Final Reserve Report</U>&quot;), which shall be reviewed by Tillinghast Towers-Perrin, or another actuary designated by the Seller and engaged at the Seller's sole cost and expense, and which shall set forth (a) the Development Amount as of December 31, 2009, (b)&nbsp;the Final Covered Reserves and (c)&nbsp;the Contingent Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;3.1 hereof as of December 31, 2009.  The Purchaser shall deliver a copy of the Final Reserve Report to the Seller within ninety days following December 31, 2009, along with all such underwriting, actuarial and other information reasonably related thereto.  The section of the Final Reserve Report setting forth the Final Covered Reserves shall be prepared in the same format as the Annual Reserve Reports and shall be based on SAP and generally accepted actuarial principles and on the underlying data of the Company and the Subsidiaries (as if on a consolidated, stand-alone basis) used to report reserves in the Statutory Statements as of the Report Date.  If there is no Dispute with respect to the Final Reserve Report, Sierra shall deliver written notice, signed by an authorized officer of Sierra, to such effect to the Purchaser indicating its acceptance thereof and agreement to be bound thereby (&quot;<U>Acceptance Notice</U>&quot;).  Following its receipt of the Acceptance Notice, the Purchaser shall pay the Contingent Purchase Price to the Seller in accordance with Article 3 hereof.  </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3&nbsp;<U>Dispute Resolution</U>.</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sierra may object to the Final Reserve Report (a &quot;<U>Dispute</U>&quot;) after having received the Final Reserve Report or, if such Final Reserve Report is not timely received, after expiration of the 90 day period for the submission thereof.  The Dispute resolution procedures shall be as follows:</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sierra shall give the Purchaser written notice of such Dispute (a &quot;<U>Dispute Notice</U>&quot;) within 60 days after the applicable date set forth above in the first paragraph of this Section&nbsp;4.3, which Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the elements and amounts in the Final Reserve Report to which Sierra objects and the basis for such objection and shall also set forth (a) the Development Amount, (b) the Final Covered Reserves and (c) the Contingent Purchase Price as calculated by Sierra.  If Sierra fails to timely deliver a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser within the aforementioned 60 day period, the Final Reserve Report shall be deemed to have been accepted in the form in which it was so delivered, shall be final and binding upon the parties in the absence of fraud, and shall serve as the basis for determining the Contingent Purchase Price.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sierra timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Purchaser, the Sierra and the Purchaser shall initially attempt to resolve the Dispute through good faith negotiations and consultations.  If the Dispute has not been resolved amicably within 20 days after Sierra provides notice thereof, unless Sierra and the Purchaser agree otherwise, the Dispute shall immediately be submitted to Ernst &amp; Young LLP (the &quot;<U>Arbiter</U>&quot;) for resolution, provided Ernst &amp; Young LLP is then disinterested.  If Ernst &amp; Young LLP shall refuse to serve as the Arbiter or shall otherwise not be disinterested at the time it is requested to serve in such capacity, the Arbiter shall be selected by each party naming three candidates (none of which shall have any material relationship with the parties hereto or their respective Affiliates), two of which shall be stricken by the counterparty, with the selection from the remaining two candidates made by lottery.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company to, upon reasonable prior notice, provide the Purchaser, Sierra and the Arbiter access to books, records and other documents and materials relating to the Company and/or to the Subsidiaries that are relevant to a determination of the issues involved in the Dispute.  The Arbiter shall decide all matters relating to the procedures to be followed for resolution of the Dispute, including those relating to the submission and receipt of information and documents; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that at the request of either Sierra or the Purchaser, a meeting shall be held at which the parties may present their views, that both Sierra and the Purchaser shall have equal access to the Arbiter, and that all information and documents which either party delivers or makes available to the Arbiter shall be furnished to the other party as well, and that all information and documents which the Company or the Subsidiaries deliver or make available to the Arbiter shall be furnished to both Sierra and the Purchaser.  Within 30 days from the date the Dispute is submitted to the Arbiter, the Arbiter shall deliver to both the Purchaser and Sierra a written report setting forth a determination of the amounts required to be set forth in the Final Reserve Report and the reasons underlying the foregoing determinations.  Such report shall be final and binding on Sierra, the Seller and the Purchaser and shall serve as the basis for determining the Contingent Purchase Price.  The Arbiter shall base its decision on its independent judgment which shall be binding on the parties.</p>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fees and expenses of the Arbiter arising from such arbitration shall be paid by the parties pro rata based on where the Arbiter's best point estimate of the Development Amount falls in comparison to Sierra's and the Purchaser's estimate; <U>provided</U>, that if the Development Amount as determined by the Arbiter is greater than the amount determined by the Purchaser, Sierra shall bear all such fees and expenses, and if the Development Amount as determined by the Arbiter is less than the amount determined by Sierra, the Purchaser shall bear all such fees and expenses.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4&nbsp;<U>Other Covenants</U>.
