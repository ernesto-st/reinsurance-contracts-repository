To Each of the Persons Listed in
the Attached Schedule A (the "PURCHASERS"):

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      Crawford & Company, a Georgia corporation (together with its successors
and assigns, the "COMPANY"), and Crawford & Company International, Inc., a
Georgia corporation (together with its successors and assigns, the "CO-ISSUER"
and together with the Company, the "ISSUERS"), jointly and severally agree with
each Purchaser as follows:

1.    AUTHORIZATION OF NOTES.

      The Issuers will authorize the joint and several issue and sale of
$50,000,000 aggregate principal amount of their joint and several 6.08% Senior
Guarantied Notes due October 10, 2010 (the "NOTES", such term to include any
such notes issued in substitution therefor pursuant to Section 13 of this
Agreement). The Notes shall be substantially in the form set out in Exhibit 1,
with such changes therefrom, if any, as may be approved by the Purchasers and
the Issuers. Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in
Schedule B; references to a "Schedule" or an "Exhibit" are, unless otherwise
specified, references to a Schedule or an Exhibit attached to this Agreement;
references to Sections are, unless otherwise specified, references to Sections
of this Agreement.

2.    SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES.

      Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Issuers will
issue and sell to each Purchaser and each Purchaser will purchase from the
Issuers, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount
specified

<PAGE>

opposite each Purchaser's name in Schedule A at the purchase price of 100% of
the principal amount thereof. The obligations of the Purchasers hereunder are
several and not joint and no Purchaser shall have any liability to any Person
for the performance or non-performance by any other Purchaser hereunder.

3.    CLOSING.

      The sale and purchase of the Notes to be purchased by each of the
Purchasers shall occur at the offices of Bingham McCutchen LLP, One State
Street, Hartford, CT 06103, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at a closing (the
"CLOSING") on October 10, 2003 or on such other Business Day thereafter on or
prior to October 31, 2003 as may be agreed upon by the Issuers and the
Purchasers. At the Closing the Issuers will deliver to each Purchaser the Notes
to be purchased by it in the form of a single Note (or such greater number of
Notes in denominations of at least $100,000 as each such Purchaser may request)
dated the date of the Closing and registered in such Purchaser's name (or in the
name of its nominee), against delivery by such Purchaser to the Issuers or their
order of immediately available funds in the amount of the purchase price
therefor by wire transfer of immediately available funds for the account of the
Issuers to account number ___________ at SunTrust Bank, Atlanta, GA, ____
________________________________ for the benefit of Crawford & Company. If at
the Closing either Issuer shall fail to tender such Notes to any Purchaser as
provided above in this Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in Section
4 shall not have been fulfilled to each Purchaser's satisfaction, such Purchaser
shall, at its election, be relieved of all further obligations under this
Agreement, without thereby waiving any rights each such Purchaser may have by
reason of such failure or such nonfulfillment.

4.    CONDITIONS TO CLOSING.

      Each Purchaser's obligation to purchase and pay for the Notes to be sold
to it at the Closing is subject to the fulfillment to each such Purchaser's
satisfaction, prior to or at the Closing, of the following conditions:

      4.1.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

      The representations and warranties of each Obligor contained in the
Financing Documents shall be correct when made and at the time of the Closing.

      4.2.  PERFORMANCE; NO DEFAULT.

conditions contained in the Financing Documents required to be performed or
complied with by it prior to or at the Closing and after giving effect to the
issuance and sale of the Notes (and the application of the proceeds thereof as
contemplated

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

                  each Purchaser an Officer's Certificate, dated the date of the
                  Closing, certifying that the conditions specified in Sections
                  4.1, 4.2 and 4.9 have been fulfilled, substantially in the
                  form of Exhibit 4.3(a) hereto.

            (b)   Officer's Certificate. The Co-Issuer shall have delivered to
                  each Purchaser an Officer's Certificate, dated the date of the

                  of its secretary or its assistant secretary (or, in the case
                  of certain Initial Guarantors, a certificate of the secretary
                  of its sole shareholder or general partner, as the case may
                  be) dated the date of the Closing certifying as to the
                  resolutions attached thereto and other corporate proceedings
                  relating to the authorization, execution and delivery of the
                  Financing Documents to which such Person is a party,
                  substantially in the form of Exhibit 4.3(c) hereto.

transactions, substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit 4.4(b) and covering
such other matters incident to such transactions as any Purchaser may reasonably
request.

      4.5.  PURCHASE PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ETC.

      On the date of the Closing, each Purchaser's purchase of Notes shall (a)
be permitted by the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction to which it is
subject,

                                      -3-

without recourse to provisions (such as section 1405(a)(8) of the New York

      5.1.  ORGANIZATION; POWER AND AUTHORITY.

      The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, and is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions
as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has the corporate power and authority to own or hold
under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease, to transact
the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute and deliver the
Financing Documents to which it is a party and to perform the provisions hereof
and thereof.

      5.2.  AUTHORIZATION, ETC.

            (a) This Agreement, the Notes and the other Financing Documents to
      which either Issuer is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary
      corporate action on the part of such Issuer, and the Financing Documents
      to which such Issuer is a party constitute, and upon execution and
      delivery thereof each Note will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
      obligation of such Issuer enforceable against such Issuer in accordance
      with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)
      applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
      similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
      (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
      enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

            (b) The Guaranty Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary
      corporate action on the part of each Initial Guarantor, and the Guaranty
      Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each
      Initial Guarantor enforceable against each Initial Guarantor in accordance
      with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i)
      applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
      similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
      (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
      enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

      5.3.  DISCLOSURE.

      The Issuers, through their agent, SunTrust Capital Markets, Inc. have
delivered to each Purchaser a copy of a Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum, dated July 2003 (the "MEMORANDUM"), relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Memorandum fairly describes, in all material respects,
the general nature of the business and principal properties of the Issuers and
their Subsidiaries. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.3, this Agreement, the

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

Memorandum, the documents, certificates or other writings delivered to each
Purchaser by or on behalf of the Obligors in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and the financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, taken
as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in
the Memorandum or as expressly described in Schedule 5.3, or in one of the
documents, certificates or other writings identified therein, or in the
financial statements listed in Schedule 5.5, since December 31, 2002, there has
been no change in the financial condition, operations, business, properties or
prospects of either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary except changes that
individually or in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no fact known to the Issuers that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been set
forth herein or in the Memorandum or in the other documents, certificates and
other writings delivered to each Purchaser by or on behalf of the Issuers
specifically for use in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

      5.4.  ORGANIZATION AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF SUBSIDIARIES; AFFILIATES.

            (a) Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
      correct lists (i) of the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each
      Subsidiary, the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its
      organization, the percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock
      or similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Company and each
      other Subsidiary and whether or not such Subsidiary is a Dormant Company,
      (ii) of the Company's Affiliates, other than Subsidiaries, and (iii) of
      each of the Issuer's directors and senior officers.

            (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
      interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the
      Company and the Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and
      nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and
      clear of any Lien in the case of the capital stock of the Co-Issuer, and
      in the case of the capital stock or other equity interests of all other
      Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Lien except Liens that would be
      permitted by Section 10.3 or as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).

            (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 other than any
      Dormant Company is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized,
      validly existing and (to the extent such concept is recognized in such
      jurisdiction) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
      organization, and (to the extent such concepts are recognized in such
      jurisdictions) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or other legal
      entity

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

      and (to the extent such concept is recognized in such jurisdictions) is in
      good standing in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is required
      by law, other than those jurisdictions as to which the failure to be so
      qualified or in good standing could not, individually or in the aggregate,
      reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each such
      Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and authority to own or hold
      under lease the properties it purports to own or hold under lease and to
      transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact, to execute
      and deliver the Financing Documents to which such Subsidiary is a party
      and to perform the provisions thereof.

            (d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any legal
      restriction or any agreement (other than this Agreement, the agreements
      listed on Schedule 5.4 and customary limitations imposed by corporate law
      statutes) restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to pay dividends out
      of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits to the
      Company or any Subsidiary that owns outstanding shares of capital stock or
      similar equity interests of such Subsidiary.

      5.5.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

      The Company has delivered to each Purchaser copies of the financial
statements of the Company and the Subsidiaries listed on Schedule 5.5. All of
said financial statements (including in each case the related schedules and
notes) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the respective dates
specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved except
as set forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case of any interim financial
statements, to normal year-end adjustments) and additional information set forth
in year-end financial statements.

      5.6.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER INSTRUMENTS, ETC.

      The execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor of the Financing
Documents to which such Obligor is a party will not (a) contravene, result in
any breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation of any
Lien in respect of any property of the Company or any Subsidiary under, any
indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease,
memorandum or articles of association, corporate charter or by-laws, or any
other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is bound or
by which the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties may
be bound or affected, (b) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any
court, arbitrator or

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or (c)
violate any provision of any statute or other rule or regulation of any
Governmental Authority applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary.

      5.7.  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC.

      No consent, approval or authorization of, or registration, filing or
declaration with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance by (a) each of the Issuers of the Financing
Documents to which such Issuer is a party and (b) each Initial Guarantor of the
Guaranty Agreement.

      5.8.  LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND ORDERS.

            (a) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.8, there are no actions, suits
      or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of either Issuer, threatened
      against or affecting either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary or any
      property of either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary in any court or before
      any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority
      that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
      have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) Neither of the Issuers nor any Subsidiary is in default under
      any term of any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which
      it is bound, or any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court,
      arbitrator or Governmental Authority or is in violation of any applicable
      law, ordinance, rule or regulation (including without limitation
      Environmental Laws) of any Governmental Authority, which default or
      violation, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.9.  TAXES.

            (a) Each of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries have filed all tax
      returns that are required to have been filed in any jurisdiction except
      for any such returns that may be required to be filed in jurisdictions
      other than the United States and political subdivisions thereof, which
      returns, in the aggregate, would not reflect an amount of Taxes owing that
      would be Material. Each of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries has paid all
      Taxes required to have been paid on all returns that have been filed and
      all other Taxes levied upon them or their properties, assets, income or
      franchises, to the extent such Taxes have become due and payable and
      before they have become delinquent, except for any Taxes (i) the amount of
      which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (ii) the amount,
      applicability or validity of which is currently being contested in good
      faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to which such Issuer or
      a Subsidiary, as the

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

      case may be, has established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP.
      Neither Issuer knows of any basis for any other Tax that could reasonably
      be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Issuers
      and their Subsidiaries in respect of all Taxes for all fiscal periods are
      adequate. The Federal income tax liabilities of the Company and the
      Subsidiaries have been determined by the Internal Revenue Service and paid
      for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended December
      31, 1999.

      5.10. TITLE TO PROPERTY; LEASES.

      Each of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries (other than any Dormant Company)
has good and sufficient title to their respective properties that individually
or in the aggregate are Material, including all such properties reflected in the
most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to
have been acquired by either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary after said date
(except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in
each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by this Agreement. All leases that
individually or in the aggregate are Material are valid and subsisting and are
in full force and effect in all material respects.

      5.11. LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC.

      Each of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed, or
otherwise has the right, to use, all patents, trademarks, service marks,
tradenames, copyrights and other intellectual property Material to its business,
and the use thereof by the Issuers and the Subsidiaries does not infringe on the
rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

      5.12. COMPLIANCE WITH ERISA.

            (a) The Company and each ERISA Affiliate have operated and
      administered each US Plan in compliance with all applicable laws except
      for such instances of noncompliance as have not resulted in and could not
      reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
      Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability pursuant to
      Title I or IV of ERISA or the penalty or excise tax provisions of the US
      Tax Code relating to employee pension benefit plans (as defined in section
      3 of ERISA), and no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists
      that could reasonably be expected to result in the incurrence of any such
      liability by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, or in the imposition of
      any Lien on any

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

      of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
      in either case pursuant to Title I or IV of ERISA or to such penalty or
      excise tax provisions or to section 401(a)(29) or 412 of the US Tax Code,
      other than such liabilities or Liens as would not be individually or in
      the aggregate Material.

            (b) As determined by the Company's actuary, the present value of the
      aggregate projected benefit obligation of all underfunded US Plans
      determined as of January 1, 2003 (based on the assumptions used for
      purposes of Statement of Financial Standards No. 87) did not exceed the
      aggregate fair value of the assets of all such underfunded US Plans by
      more than $67,000,000 as of such date.

            (c) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have not incurred
      withdrawal liabilities (and are not subject to contingent withdrawal
      liabilities) under section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA in respect of
      Multiemployer Plans that individually or in the aggregate are Material.

            (d) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the issuance
      and sale of the Notes to each Purchaser hereunder will not involve any
      transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section
      406(a)(1)(A)-(E) of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be
      imposed by sections 4975(a) and (b) of the US Tax Code by reason of
      section 4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the US Tax Code. The representation by the
      Company in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(d) is made in reliance
      upon and subject to the accuracy of the representation in Section 6.2 from
      each Purchaser and each transferee of a Note as to the sources of the
      funds used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by such
      Purchaser or acquired by such transferee.

      5.13. PRIVATE OFFERING BY THE ISSUERS.

      Neither the Issuers nor anyone acting on their behalf has offered the
Notes or any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any
of the same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with,
in each case within one year of the date of the Closing, any Person other than
the Purchasers, each of whom has been offered the Notes at a private sale for
investment. Neither the Issuers nor anyone acting on their behalf has taken, or
will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes to
the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act or to the
provisions of any securities or Blue Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.

      5.14. USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS.

      The Issuers will apply the proceeds of the sale of the Notes as set forth
in Schedule 5.14 and none of the proceeds will be used to make any loan or other

                                      -11-

<PAGE>

Investment in any Dormant Company. No part of the proceeds from the sale of the
Notes hereunder will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying
or carrying any margin stock within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the United States Federal Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the
purpose of buying or carrying or trading in any securities under such
circumstances as to involve the Issuers in a violation of Regulation X of said
Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or dealer in a violation of
Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock does not constitute more
than 5% of the value of the consolidated assets of the Issuers and their
Subsidiaries and neither Issuer has any present intention that margin stock will
constitute more than 5% of the value of such assets. As used in this Section,
the terms "MARGIN STOCK" and "PURPOSE OF BUYING OR CARRYING" shall have the
meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.

      5.15. EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS; FUTURE LIENS.

            (a) Except as described therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete
      and correct list of all outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuers and their
      Subsidiaries as of August 31, 2003, since which date there has been no
      Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds, installment
      payments or maturities of the Indebtedness of either of the Issuers or any
      Subsidiary. Neither of the Issuers nor any Subsidiary is in default and no
      waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal
      or interest on any Indebtedness of either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary
      and no event or condition exists with respect to any Indebtedness of
      either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary that would permit (or that with
      notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to
      cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable before its stated
      maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.

            (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither of the Issuers nor
      any Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future
      (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property,
      whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien that
      would not be permitted by Section 10.3.

      5.16. FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS, ETC.

      Neither the sale of the Notes by the Issuers hereunder nor their use of
the proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the Enemy Act of the United
States of America, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations
of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as
amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto.

                                      -12-

      5.17. STATUS UNDER CERTAIN STATUTES.

      Neither of the Issuers nor any Subsidiary:

            (a) is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of
      1940 of the United States of America, as amended, the Public Utility
      Holding Company Act of 1935 of the United States of America, as amended,
      or the Federal Power Act of 1920 of the United States of America, as
      amended;

            (b) is or will become a Person or entity described by section 1 of
      Executive Order 13224 of September 24, 2001 Blocking Property and
      Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten To Commit, or
      Support Terrorism, 31 CFR Part 595 et seq., and, to the best knowledge and
      belief of each Issuer, neither of the Issuers nor any Subsidiary does or
      will engage in any dealings or transactions, or be otherwise associated,
      with any such Persons or entities; or

            (c) is in violation of the USA Patriot Act.

      5.18. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

      Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.18 and except for matters which could

Issuers nor any Subsidiary (a) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law
or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval
required under any Environmental Law, (b) has become subject to any
Environmental Liability, (c) has received notice of any claim with respect to
any Environmental Liability or (d) knows of any basis for any Environmental
Liability in each case.

      5.19. PARI PASSU RANKING.

      Each of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes and this Agreement do and
will, upon issuance of the Notes, rank at least pari passu, without preference
or priority, with all of its other outstanding unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations, except for those obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law
and not by reason of contract (other than as provided in the Sharing Agreement).

      5.20. NOT SUBJECT TO IMMUNITY.

      Each of the Issuers represents and warrants that neither it nor any other
Obligor is entitled to immunity from judicial proceedings and agrees that, if
judicial proceedings are brought by any holder of Notes to enforce any right or
remedy under any Financing Documents, no immunity from such proceedings will be
claimed by or on behalf of any Obligor or with respect to it or its respective
properties.

                                      -13-

      5.21. DORMANT COMPANIES.

      Except as set forth in Schedule 5.21, no Dormant Company owns any Material
assets or has any outstanding Indebtedness or other Material liabilities. The
aggregate revenues and assets of the Dormant Companies are less than 1% of the
aggregate revenue and assets of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries.

      5.22. BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT REPRESENTATIONS.

      Each of the representations and warranties set forth in section 4 of the
Bank Credit Agreement is true and correct in all Material respects on and as of
the date of the Closing.

6.    REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.

      6.1.  PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT.

      Each Purchaser represents that (a) it is a Qualified Institutional Buyer
and (b) it is purchasing the Notes for its own account or for one or more
separate accounts or investment funds maintained or managed by such Purchaser or
for the account of one or more pension or trust funds and not with a view to the
distribution thereof, provided that the disposition of such Purchaser's property
shall at all times be within such Purchaser's control. Each Purchaser
understands that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and
may be resold only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities
Act or if an exemption from registration is available, except under
circumstances where neither such registration nor such an exemption is required
by law, and that the Issuers are not required to register the Notes.

      6.2.  SOURCE OF FUNDS.

      Each Purchaser represents that at least one of the following statements is
an accurate representation as to each source of funds (a "SOURCE") to be used by
such Purchaser to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by it
hereunder:

            (a) the Source is an "insurance company general account" (as the
      term is defined in the United States Department of Labor's Prohibited
      Transaction Exemption ("PTE") 95-60 (issued July 12, 1995) in respect of
      which the reserves and liabilities (as defined by the annual statement for
      life insurance companies approved by the National Association of Insurance
      Commissioners (the "NAIC ANNUAL STATEMENT")) for the general account
      contract(s) held by or on behalf of any employee benefit plan together
      with the amount of the reserves and liabilities for the general account
      contract(s)

                                      -14-

<PAGE>

      held by or on behalf of any other employee benefit plans maintained by the
      same employer (or affiliate thereof as defined in PTE 95-60) or by the
      same employee organization in the general account do not exceed 10% of the
      total reserves and liabilities of the general account (exclusive of
      separate account liabilities) plus surplus as set forth in the NAIC Annual
      Statement filed with such Purchaser's state of domicile; or

            (b) the Source is a separate account that is maintained solely in
      connection with such Purchaser's fixed contractual obligations under which
      the amounts payable, or credited, to any employee benefit plan (or its
      related trust) that has any interest in such separate account (or to any
      participant or beneficiary of such plan (including any annuitant)) are not
      affected in any manner by the investment performance of the separate

8. PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

      8.1. REQUIRED PREPAYMENTS.

      On October 10, 2006 and on April 10, 2007 and each October 10 and April 10
thereafter to and including April 10, 2010, the Issuers will prepay
$5,555,555.56 principal amount (or such lesser principal amount as shall then be
outstanding) of the Notes at par and without payment of the Make-Whole Amount or
any premium, provided that upon any partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to
Section 8.2 the principal amount of each required prepayment of the Notes
becoming due under this Section 8.1 on and after the date of such prepayment or
any purchase thereof pursuant to Section 8.5 shall be reduced in the same
proportion as the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes is reduced as a
result of such prepayment or purchase. Subject to Section 12.1, any remaining
principal of, and the interest then accrued and unpaid on, the Notes shall be
due and payable on October 10, 2010.

      8.2. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS WITH MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

      The Issuers may, at their option, upon notice as provided below, prepay at
any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $1,000,000 in the case of a partial
prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus the Make-Whole
Amount determined for the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount.
The Issuers will give each holder of Notes written notice of each optional
prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not more than 60
days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment. Each such notice shall specify
such date, the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such
date, the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid
(determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the interest to be paid on the
prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and shall
be accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer as to the
estimated Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment (calculated
as if the date of such notice were the date of the prepayment), setting forth
the details of such computation. Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the
Issuers shall deliver to each holder of Notes a certificate of a Senior
Financial Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the
specified prepayment date.

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

      8.3. ALLOCATION OF PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS.

      In the case of each partial prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section
8.2 and each purchase of Notes pursuant to Section 8.5, the principal amount of
the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time
outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid
principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

      8.4. MATURITY; SURRENDER, ETC.

      In the case of each prepayment of Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the
principal amount of each Note to be prepaid shall mature and become due and
payable on the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such
principal amount accrued to such date and the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if
any. From and after such date, unless the Issuers shall fail to pay such
principal amount when so due and payable, together with the interest and
Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid, interest on such principal amount shall
cease to accrue. Any Note paid or prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the
Issuers and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in
lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note.

      8.5. PURCHASE OF NOTES.

      Neither Issuer will, and neither Issuer will permit any Affiliate to,
purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of
the outstanding Notes except (a) upon the payment or prepayment of the Notes in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes or (b) pursuant to an
offer to purchase made by the Issuers or an Affiliate pro rata to the holders of
all Notes at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions. Any such
offer shall provide each holder with sufficient information to enable it to make
an informed decision with respect to such offer, and shall remain open for at
least 30 days. If the holders of more than 50% of the principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding accept such offer, the Issuers shall promptly notify the
remaining holders of such fact and the expiration date for the acceptance by
holders of Notes of such offer shall be extended by the number of days necessary
to give each such remaining holder at least five (5) Business Days from its
receipt of such notice to accept such offer. The Issuers will promptly cancel
all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment or
purchase of Notes pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and no Notes may
be issued in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.

      8.6. MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

      The term "MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT" means, with respect to any Note, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the
amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount may in no
event be less than zero. For the purposes of determining the Make-Whole Amount,
the following terms have the following meanings:

            "CALLED PRINCIPAL" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of
      such Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2 or has become or
      is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as
      the context requires.

            "DISCOUNTED VALUE" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
      any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled
      Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective
      scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
      Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a
      discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which
      interest on such Note is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with
      respect to such Called Principal.

            "REINVESTMENT YIELD" means, with respect to the Called Principal of
      any Note, 0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by (a) the yields
      reported, as of 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the second Business Day
      preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal on the
      display designated as "Page 678" on the Moneyline Telerate Service (or
      such other display as may replace Page 678 on the Moneyline Telerate
      Service) for actively traded on the run US Treasury securities having a
      maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as
      of such Settlement Date, or (b) if such yields are not reported as of such
      time or the yields reported as of such time are not ascertainable, the
      Treasury Constant Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for
      which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day
      preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in
      Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) (or any comparable
      successor publication) for actively traded US Treasury securities having a
      constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called
      Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield will be
      determined, if necessary, by (i) converting US Treasury bill quotations to
      bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and
      (ii) interpolating linearly between (x) the actively traded US Treasury
      Security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Remaining
      Average Life and (y) the actively traded US Treasury Security with the
      maturity closest to and less than the Remaining Average Life.

            "REMAINING AVERAGE LIFE" means, with respect to the Called Principal
      of any Note, the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

      twelfth year) obtained by dividing (a) such Called Principal into (b) the
      sum of the products obtained by multiplying (i) the principal component of
      each Remaining Scheduled Payment with respect to such Called Principal by
      (ii) the number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) that
      will elapse between the Settlement Date with respect to such Called
      Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining Scheduled Payment.

            "REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS" means, with respect to the Called
      Principal of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest
      thereon that would be due after the Settlement Date with respect to such
      Called Principal if no payment of such Called Principal were made prior to
      its scheduled due date, provided that if such Settlement Date is not a
      date on which interest payments are due to be made under the terms of such
      Note, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled interest payment
      will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such Settlement Date
      and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to Section 8.2 or
      Section 12.1.

            "SETTLEMENT DATE" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
      Note, the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to
      Section 8.2 or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable
      pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

      Each of the Issuers covenants that so long as any of the Notes are
outstanding:

      9.1. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

      Each of the Issuers will and will cause each Subsidiary to comply with all
laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is
subject, including, without limitation, ERISA and Environmental Laws, and will
obtain and maintain in effect all licenses, certificates, permits, franchises
and other governmental authorizations necessary to the ownership of their
respective properties or to the conduct of their respective businesses, in each
case to the extent necessary to ensure that non-compliance with such laws,
ordinances or governmental rules or regulations or failures to obtain or
maintain in effect such licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other
governmental authorizations could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      9.2. INSURANCE.

                                      -24-

financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to their
respective properties and businesses against such casualties and contingencies,
of such types, on such terms and in such amounts (including deductibles,
co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate reserves are maintained with
respect thereto) as is customary in the case of entities of established
reputations engaged in the same or a similar business and similarly situated.

      9.3. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES.

      Each of the Issuers will and will cause each Subsidiary other than any
Dormant Company to maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and kept, their
respective properties in good repair, working order and condition (other than
ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in connection therewith
may be properly conducted at all times, provided that this Section shall not
prevent either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary from discontinuing the operation
and the maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is desirable
in the conduct of its business and such Issuer has concluded that such
discontinuance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      9.4. PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS.

      Each of the Issuers will and will cause each Subsidiary to file all tax
returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all
taxes required to be paid on such returns and all other taxes, assessments,
governmental charges, or levies imposed on them or any of their properties,
assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have
become due and payable and before they have become delinquent and all claims for
which sums have become due and payable that have or might become a Lien on
properties or assets of either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary, provided that
neither of the Issuers nor any Subsidiary need pay any such tax or assessment or
claims if (a) the amount, applicability or validity thereof is contested by such
Issuer or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good faith and in appropriate
proceedings, and such Issuer or a Subsidiary has established adequate reserves
therefor in accordance with GAAP on the books of such Issuer or such Subsidiary
or (b) the nonpayment of all such taxes and assessments in the aggregate could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      9.5. CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC.

      Each of the Issuers will at all times preserve and keep in full force and
effect its corporate existence. Subject to Sections 9.3, 10.2 and 10.4, each of
the Issuers will at all times preserve and keep in full force and effect the
corporate existence of

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

each Subsidiary other than any Dormant Company (unless merged into an Issuer or
a Subsidiary (other than a Dormant Company)) and all rights and franchises of
such Issuer and its Subsidiaries (other than a Dormant Company) unless, in the
good faith judgment of such Issuer, the termination of or failure to preserve
and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise
could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

      9.6. NEW SUBSIDIARY GUARANTOR; ADDITIONAL PLEDGED STOCK.

            (a) The Issuers will (i) cause each Person that, after the date of
      the Closing, becomes a Domestic Subsidiary that is a "significant
      subsidiary" within the meaning of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act, and
      each Subsidiary that ceases to be a Dormant Company pursuant to Section
      9.11, to become, promptly and in any event within fifteen (15) Business
      Days of becoming a Domestic Subsidiary or ceasing to be a Dormant Company,
      as the case may be, an additional guarantor pursuant to the terms of the
      Guaranty Agreement and (ii) deliver to each of the holders of Notes, to
      the extent reasonably requested by the Required Holders, copies of
      authorizing resolutions, bylaws and other constitutive documents and
      financial information of such Person, as well as an opinion of independent
      counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, as to the due
      execution, delivery and enforceability of such Person's obligations as a
      Guarantor, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required
      Holders.

            (b) The Company will promptly, and in any event within fifteen (15)
      Business Days of any Person becoming (i) a Foreign Subsidiary of the
      Company or (ii) a Foreign Subsidiary that is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary
      of either Issuer that, in each case, is a "significant subsidiary" within
      the meaning of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act, after the date of the
      Closing, (A) pledge, or cause to be pledged, the Applicable Pledge Amount
      of any equity interests of such Foreign Subsidiary pursuant to the Pledge
      Agreement, and (B) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Agent, on
      behalf of the holders of Notes, the original stock or membership
      certificate(s) evidencing such equity interests and undated stock powers
      executed in blank.

      9.7. PARI PASSU RANKING.

      Each of the Issuers shall ensure that its payment obligations under this
Agreement and the Notes rank and will at all times rank at least pari passu in
all respects with the claims of all of its other unsecured and unsubordinated
creditors, respectively, except as may be otherwise provided for in the Sharing
Agreement with respect to the Debt under the Bank Credit Agreement, save those
whose claims are preferred by any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation,
administration or other similar laws of general application.

      9.8. MOST FAVORED LENDER PROVISIONS.

            (a) NEW AND AMENDED COVENANTS. If at any time and from time to time
      on or after the date of the Closing either of the Issuers or any
      Subsidiary enters into, assumes or otherwise becomes bound or obligated
      under, or agrees to any new agreement with the lenders under the Bank
      Credit Agreement or, without derogating from any of the restrictions
      contained herein, any amendment, modification of or supplement to the Bank
      Credit Agreement or any agreement which relates to the Bank Credit
      Agreement in any manner the effect of which would be (i) to create, amend
      or add covenants or obligations of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries which
      are in addition to those contained in the Bank Credit Agreement (as in
      effect on the date of the Closing) or (ii) more restrictive on the Issuers
      or any Subsidiary than are the equivalent covenants (other than the
      Specified Financial Covenants) contained herein (the "NEW/AMENDED COVENANT
      PROVISIONS"), then this Agreement shall, without any further action on the
      part of either Issuer, any Subsidiary or any holder of Notes, be deemed to
      be amended automatically to include each such New/Amended Covenant
      Provision, effective as of the effective date of such New/Amended Covenant
      Provision; provided, that the Required Holders and the Issuers may agree
      in writing not to so amend this Agreement. For the purposes of clause (ii)
      above, in the event that (A) any such amendment, modification or
      supplement reduces a sum certain dollar amount in the Bank Credit
      Agreement, which reduction has the effect of making a covenant in the Bank
      Credit Agreement more restrictive than a covenant contained herein and (B)
      the corresponding covenant contained herein is a percentage rather than a
      sum certain dollar amount, then such percentage contained herein shall be
      reduced and shall thereafter be equal to the product (expressed as a
      percentage) of (x) such percentage herein immediately before giving effect
      to such amendment, modification or supplement, multiplied by (y) a
      fraction, the numerator of which is the sum certain dollar amount in the
      Bank Credit Agreement immediately after giving effect to such amendment,
      modification or supplement and the denominator of which is the sum certain
      dollar amount stated in the Bank Credit Agreement immediately prior to
      giving effect to such amendment, modification or supplement. By way of
      example, if the definition of the "Permitted Acquisition Basket" in the
      Bank Credit Agreement were amended to reduce the sum certain dollar amount
      from $15,000,000 to $9,000,000 (a 40% reduction), then the percentage in
      the definition of Permitted Acquisition herein would be reduced to 6% from
      10% (a 40% reduction).

            (b) SPECIFIED FINANCIAL COVENANTS. If at any time and from time to
      time after the date of the Closing, either Issuer or any Subsidiary enters

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

      into, assumes or otherwise becomes bound or obligated under, or agrees to,
      any modification of or amendment or supplement to the Bank Credit
      Agreement in respect of or that contains provisions (the "SPECIFIED
      PROVISIONS") that are the same as or similar to the covenants set forth in
      Sections 10.5, 10.6 or 10.7 (as in effect from time to time after giving
      effect to this Section 9.8, the "SPECIFIED FINANCIAL COVENANTS"), and one
      or more of such Specified Provisions is more restrictive on the Issuers or
      any Subsidiary than the equivalent Specified Financial Covenants, then
      such equivalent Specified Financial Covenants shall, without any further
      action on the part of either Issuer, any Subsidiary or any holder of
      Notes, be deemed to be amended automatically to be as restrictive as the
      relevant Specified Provision as of the effective date of such Specified
      Provision; provided, however, that at all times subsequent to the date of
      the DOJ Settlement Payment, the required ratios of Consolidated Funded
      Debt to Consolidated EBITDA set forth in Section 10.5 shall each have a
      numerator that is the lesser of (i) the relevant numerator set forth in
      such section (as of the date of the Closing) or (ii) a numerator that is
      0.25 higher than that specified in the Bank Credit Agreement (after giving
      effect to any applicable Specified Provision) for the relevant time period
      (after converting, if necessary, the ratios in the Bank Credit Agreement
      to the method of presentation in Section 10.5).

            (c) WRITTEN AMENDMENT; SUCCESSIVE CHANGES. Each of the Issuers
      further covenants to promptly, and in any event within 30 days, execute
      and deliver at its expense (including, without limitation, the fees and
      expenses of counsel for the holders of the Notes) a document which amends
      this Agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Required Holders
      to reflect any change to this Agreement made effective by this Section
      9.8, provided that the execution and delivery of such document shall not
      be a precondition to the effectiveness of such amendment, waiver or
      termination. The provisions of this Section 9.8 shall apply successively
      to each New/Amended Covenant Provision and each change in a Specified
      Provision.

      9.9. COVENANT TO SECURE NOTES EQUALLY.

      Each Issuer covenants that, if it or any Subsidiary shall create or assume
any Lien to secure the Debt under the Bank Credit Agreement upon any of its
property or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, it will make or
cause to be made effective provision whereby the Notes will be secured by such
Lien equally and ratably with any and all Debt under the Bank Credit Agreement
thereby secured so long as any such other Debt shall be so secured.

      9.10. POST-CLOSING REQUIREMENTS.

      No later than 60 days following the date of the Closing, the Issuers will
deliver or cause to be delivered to the holders of Notes (a) certificates of
good standing from the office of the Secretary of State from each jurisdiction
where the ownership of property or the conduct of its business requires the
Company to be qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and (b)
certificates of good standing from the office of the Secretary of State of the
jurisdiction of incorporation of Qirra Custom Software, Inc. and the
jurisdiction where such Subsidiary maintains its principal place of business. No
later than 75 days following the date of the Closing, the Issuers will cause the
following Subsidiaries to be dissolved and shall provide the Required Holders
with reasonably satisfactory evidence of such dissolution: (i) Brocklehursts,
Inc., (ii) Brocklehurst Holdings, Inc. and (iii) Graham Miller, Inc. No later
than 30 days following the date of the Closing, the Issuers will cause all Liens
in favor of the Royal Bank of Canada set forth on Schedule 10.3 to be terminated
and released of record, and will promptly provide each holder of Note written
evidence of such termination and release. The Issuers will, within 30 days
following a request therefore by the Required Holders, cause the documents and
instruments described on Schedule 10.11 as item 1, to be terminated, or
otherwise cause the restrictive agreements or arrangements therein requiring
such items to be disclosed pursuant to Section 10.11 to be terminated and
released, and will promptly provide the holders of Notes written evidence of
such termination and release.

      9.11. DORMANT COMPANIES.

            (a) If, at any time after the date of the Closing, the Company
      decides that any Subsidiary that is a Dormant Company at such time shall
      cease being a Dormant Company, such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Dormant
      Company for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Financing
      Documents upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                  (i) the Company shall notify the holders of Notes of the
            proposed change in the status of such Subsidiary, which notice shall
            contain a certification by a Responsible Officer to the effect that
            (A) such Subsidiary is in full compliance with all provisions of
            this Agreement applicable to it as a Subsidiary that is not a
            Dormant Company, (B) each of the representations and warranties set
            forth in Section 5 that are applicable to a Subsidiary that is not a
            Dormant Company is true and correct with respect to such Subsidiary
            as of the date of such notice, and (C) no Default or Event of
            Default would result from such change in status of such Subsidiary;

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

                  (ii) if such Subsidiary is a Domestic Subsidiary and is not
            already a Guarantor, the Issuers shall cause it to become a
            Guarantor pursuant to Section 9.6(a);

                  (iii) Schedule 5.4 hereto shall be revised to reflect that
            such Subsidiary is no longer a Dormant Company; and

                  (iv) the Issuers shall have delivered such information as is
            required by Section 9.6(a).

            (b) If, at any time after the date of the Closing, the Company
      decides that any Subsidiary that is not a Dormant Company at such time
      shall become a Dormant Company, such Subsidiary shall become a Dormant
      Company for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Financing
      Documents upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                  (i) the Company shall notify the holders of Notes of the
            proposed change in the status of such Subsidiary, which notice shall

            this Agreement applicable to it as a Subsidiary that is a Dormant
            Company, (B) after giving effect to such Subsidiary becoming a
            Dormant Company, the aggregate revenues and assets of all Dormant
            Companies is less than 1% of the aggregate revenues and assets of
            the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, and (C) no Default or
            Event of Default would result from such change in status of such
            Subsidiary;

                  (ii) if the Subsidiary is a party to the Guaranty Agreement
            and is not a "significant subsidiary" within the meaning of
            Regulations S-X of the Exchange Act, the Required Holders shall
            release it from the Guaranty Agreement;

                  (iii) Schedule 5.4 hereto shall be revised to reflect that
            such Subsidiary has after such time become a Dormant Company; and

                  (iv) the Issuers shall have delivered such information
            (financial and otherwise) as is reasonably requested by the Required

      10.1. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; DORMANT COMPANIES.

      Neither Issuer will, and neither Issuer will permit any Subsidiary to,
enter into directly or indirectly any transaction or Material group of related
transactions (including without limitation the purchase, lease, sale or exchange
of properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate
(other than an Issuer or a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 10.10(b)), except (a) in the ordinary course and pursuant
to the reasonable requirements of an Issuer's or such Subsidiary's business and
upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to such Issuer or such
Subsidiary than would be obtainable in a comparable arm's-length transaction
with a Person not an Affiliate and (b) any Restricted Payment permitted by
Section 10.10(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuers will not, and will
not permit any Subsidiaries to, sell, lease or otherwise transfer any property
or assets to, or purchase, lease or otherwise acquire any property or assets
from, make any Investment in, or otherwise engage in any other transactions
with, any Dormant Company unless (i) such transaction is at prices and on terms

the Dormant Company) than could be obtained on an arm's-length basis from
unrelated third parties or involves maintaining the corporate existence, good
standing or properties of any Dormant Company and (ii) after giving effect to
such transaction, the representations and warranties contained in Section 5.21
shall be deemed remade and shall be true and correct.

      10.2. MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, ETC.

      Neither Issuer will, and neither Issuer will permit any Subsidiary (other
than any Dormant Company) to, consolidate with or merge with any other Person or
convey, Transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets in a single
transaction or series of transactions to any Person or liquidate or dissolve
(except that if at the time thereof and immediately after giving effect thereto,
no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (i) subject
to Section 10.4, any Subsidiary may liquidate or dissolve if the Issuers
determine in good faith that such liquidation or dissolution is in the best
interests of the Issuers and is not materially disadvantageous to the holders of
Notes, (ii) any Subsidiary (other than a Dormant Company) may merge with any
Person that is not a Subsidiary if such Subsidiary is the surviving Person,
(iii) any Subsidiary may merge into another Subsidiary (other than a Dormant
Company), provided, that if any party to such merger is a Guarantor (other than

dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to an Issuer or another
Guarantor (other than a Dormant Company), and (v) any Subsidiary may be sold so
long as such sale is

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

permitted under Section 10.4; provided, that any merger involving a Person that
is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary immediately prior to such merger shall not be
permitted unless also permitted by Section 10.10(b)), provided that the
foregoing restriction does not apply to the consolidation or merger of either
Issuer with, or the conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all of
the assets of either Issuer in a single transaction or series of transactions
to, any Person so long as:

            (a) the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor of
      such merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, Transfer or lease
      all or substantially all of the assets of such Issuer as an entirety, as
      the case may be (the "SUCCESSOR CORPORATION"), shall be a solvent
      corporation organized and existing under the laws of the United States or
      any state thereof (including the District of Columbia);

            (b) if such Issuer is not the Successor Corporation, such
      corporation shall have executed and delivered to each holder of Notes its
      assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance of each
      covenant and condition of this Agreement, the Notes and each other
      Financing Document to which such Issuer is a party (pursuant to such
      agreements and instruments governed by New York law and otherwise in form
      and substance as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Required
      Holders), and the Company shall have caused to be delivered to each holder
      of Notes an opinion of nationally recognized independent counsel, or other
      independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders, to
      the effect that all agreements or instruments effecting such assumption
      are enforceable in accordance with their terms and comply with the terms
      hereof; and

            (c) immediately prior to and after giving effect to such transaction
      no Default or Event of Default would exist.

No such conveyance, Transfer or lease of all or substantially all of the assets
of either Issuer shall have the effect of releasing such Issuer or any Successor
Corporation that shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in
this Section 10.2 from its liability under the Financing Documents to which such
Issuer is a party.

      10.3. LIMITATION ON LIENS.

      Neither Issuer will, and neither Issuer will permit any Subsidiary to,
directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or permit to exist (upon the
happening of a contingency or otherwise) any Lien on or with respect to any
property (including, without limitation, any document or instrument in respect
of goods or accounts receivable or book debts) of either of the Issuers or any
such Subsidiary, whether now owned or held or hereafter acquired, or any income
or profits therefrom or

assign or otherwise convey any right to receive income or profits, except:

      proceedings and for which reasonable book reserves in accordance with GAAP
      have been established;

            (c) pledges or deposits in connection with workers' compensation,
      unemployment insurance and other types of social security legislation and
      deposits securing liability to insurance carriers under insurance or
      self-insurance arrangements, provided, however, that such Liens were not
      incurred or made in connection with the borrowing of money or the
      obtaining of advances or credit;

            (d) Liens incurred or deposits to secure the performance of bids,
      tenders, contracts (other than for borrowed money), leases, statutory
      obligations, surety and appeal bonds, performance bonds and other

      provided, however, that such Liens were not incurred or made in connection
      with the borrowing of money or the obtaining of advances or credit;

            (e) any attachment or judgment Lien, unless the judgment it secures
      shall not, within 60 days after the entry thereof, have been discharged or
      execution thereof stayed pending appeal, or shall not have been discharged
      within 60 days after the expiration of any such stay;

            (f) Liens on any property of the Company and the Subsidiaries in
      existence on the date of the Closing including Liens securing the Notes
      and the Debt evidenced by the Bank Credit Agreement and other Liens so
      long as such Liens are described on Schedule 10.3; provided, such Lien
      shall not apply to any other property of either of the Issuers or any
      Subsidiary;

            (g) leases or subleases granted to others, zoning restrictions,
      easements, rights-of-way, restrictions and other similar charges or
      encumbrances, in each case incidental to, and not interfering with, the
      ordinary conduct of the business of the Issuers or any of their
      Subsidiaries,

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

      provided that such Liens do not, in the aggregate, materially detract from
      the value of such property;

            (h) any Lien created to secure all or any part of the purchase price
      or cost of construction, of property (or any improvement thereon) acquired
      or constructed by either of the Issuers or a Subsidiary after the date of
      the Closing, provided that

                  (i) any such Lien shall extend solely to the item or items of
            such property (or improvement thereon) so acquired or constructed
            (and replacement assets of the same type) and, if required by the
            terms of the instrument originally creating such Lien, other
            property (or improvement thereon) which is an improvement to or is
            acquired for specific use in connection with such acquired or
            constructed property (or improvement thereon) or which is real
            property being improved by such acquired or constructed property (or
            improvement thereon),

                  (ii) the principal amount of the Debt secured by any such Lien
            shall at no time exceed an amount equal to 100% of the lesser of (A)
            the cost to such Issuer or such Subsidiary of the property (or
            improvement thereon) so acquired or constructed and (B) the Fair
            Market Value (as determined in good faith by the board of directors
            of such Issuer or such Subsidiary) of such property (or improvement
            thereon) at the time of such acquisition or construction, and

                  (iii) any such Lien shall be created contemporaneously with,
            or within 90 days after, the acquisition or construction of such
            property;

As used in Section 11(o), the term "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in section 3 of ERISA.

12. REMEDIES ON DEFAULT, ETC.

      12.1. ACCELERATION.

            (a) If an Event of Default described in paragraph (g) or (h) of
      Section 11 (other than an Event of Default described in clause (i) of
      paragraph (g) or described in clause (vi) of paragraph (g) by virtue of
      the fact that such clause encompasses clause (i) of paragraph (g)) has
      occurred, all the Notes then outstanding shall automatically become
      immediately due and payable.

            (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
      the Required Holders may at any time at its or their option, by notice or
      notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be
      immediately due and payable.

            (c) If any Event of Default described in paragraph (a) or (b) of
      Section 11 has occurred and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes
      at the time outstanding affected by such Event of Default may at any time,
      at its or their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all
      the Notes held by it or them to be immediately due and payable.

      Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether
automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire
unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

thereon and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal
amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be
immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. Each of the Issuers
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Issuers
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Issuers in the event that the Notes are prepaid or
are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

      12.2. OTHER REMEDIES.

      If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
irrespective of whether any Notes have become or have been declared immediately
due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of any Note at the time
outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such holder by an
action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate proceeding, whether for the
specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note, or for an
injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid
of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

      12.3. RESCISSION.

      At any time after any Notes have been declared due and payable pursuant to
clause (b) or (c) of Section 12.1, the Required Holders, by written notice to
the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its consequences if
(a) the Issuers have paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all principal of
and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and payable and are
unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all interest on such
overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the Notes, at the Default
Rate, (b) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of amounts
that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been cured or
have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (c) no judgment or decree has been
entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant hereto or to the Notes. No
rescission and annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any
subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

      12.4. NO WAIVERS OR ELECTION OF REMEDIES, EXPENSES, ETC.

      No course of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in
exercising any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or
remedy

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

conferred by this Agreement or by any Note upon any holder thereof shall be
exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or therein or
now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise. Without
limiting the obligations of the Issuers under Section 15, the Issuers will pay
to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as shall be sufficient
to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in any enforcement or
collection under this Section 12, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.

13. REGISTRATION; EXCHANGE; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES.

      13.1. REGISTRATION OF NOTES.

      The Issuers shall keep at the Company's principal executive office a
register for the registration and registration of transfers of Notes. The name
and address of each holder of one or more Notes, each transfer thereof and the
name and address of each transferee of one or more Notes shall be registered in
such register. Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer, the Person
in whose name any Note shall be registered shall be deemed and treated as the
owner and holder thereof for all purposes hereof, and the Issuers shall not be
affected by any notice or knowledge to the contrary. The Issuers shall give to
any holder of a Note that is an Institutional Investor promptly upon request
therefor, a complete and correct copy of the names and addresses of all
registered holders of Notes.

13.2. TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE OF NOTES.

      Upon surrender of any Note at the principal executive office of the
Company for registration of transfer or exchange (and in the case of a surrender
for registration of transfer, duly endorsed or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or
his attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the address for
notices of each transferee of such Note or part thereof), the Issuers shall
execute and deliver, at the Issuers' expense (except as provided below), one or
more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor, in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the
surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such
holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1. Each
such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest
shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the
surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Issuers may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp tax or governmental
charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be
transferred in denominations of less than $100,000 and there shall be no more
than twenty-five holders of Notes at any time, provided that any group of two or
more holders whose investments in the Notes are managed by the same Person

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

shall be deemed to be one holder of Notes solely for purposes of determining
whether such limitation on the number of holders has been exceeded, provided
further that if necessary to enable the registration of transfer by a holder of
its entire holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than
$100,000. Subject to the provisions of this Section 13.2, any Purchaser may
transfer or exchange any Note if, in the case of a transfer, the representations
set forth in Section 6.1 (except that a transferee shall not be deemed to have
made the representation that its purchase of such Notes is not with a view to
distribution thereof) and Section 6.2 are true and correct, with the word
"Purchaser" used in such section referring to the transferee. The Company shall
not be obligated to register a transfer of Notes pursuant to this Section 13.2
if the transferee has given notice to the Company of the names of employee
benefit plans pursuant to Section 6.2(c) or Section 6.2(g) and the Company has
determined that an acquisition of Notes by the insurance company pooled separate
account or bank collective investment fund in which such employee benefit plans
have an interest, or by the employee benefit plan disclosed pursuant to Section
6.2(g), is reasonably likely to result in a transaction prohibited by section
406 of ERISA, provided that the Company gives notice of such determination to
the registered holder of such Notes and the proposed transferee within 5
Business Days after delivery to the Company of such notice setting forth the
names of the relevant employee benefit plans and a brief written description of
the prohibited transaction that the Company has determined is reasonably likely
to result from such transfer.

      13.3. REPLACEMENT OF NOTES.

      Upon receipt by the Issuers of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of
the ownership of and the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Note
(which evidence shall be, in the case of an Institutional Investor, notice from
such Institutional Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction
or mutilation), and

            (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity
      reasonably satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note
      is, or is a nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a Note
      with a minimum net worth of at least $50,000,000, such Person's own
      unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed to be satisfactory), or

            (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
      thereof,

the Issuers at their own expense shall execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a
new Note, dated and bearing interest from the date to which interest shall have
been paid on such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or dated the date of
such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest shall have been
paid thereon.

                                      -47-

14. PAYMENTS ON NOTES.

      14.1. PLACE OF PAYMENT.

      Subject to Section 14.2, payments of principal, Make-Whole Amount, if any,
and interest becoming due and payable on the Notes shall be made in Atlanta,
Georgia at the principal office of the Company in such jurisdiction. The Company
may at any time, by notice to each holder of a Note, change the place of payment
of the Notes so long as such place of payment shall be either the principal
office of the Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or
trust company in such jurisdiction.

      14.2. HOME OFFICE PAYMENT.

      So long as any Purchaser or its nominee shall be the holder of any Note,
and notwithstanding anything contained in Section 14.1 or in such Note to the
contrary, the Issuers will pay all sums becoming due on such Note for principal,
Make-Whole Amount, if any, and interest by the method and at the address
specified for such purpose below each Purchaser's name in Schedule A, or by such
other method or at such other address as such Purchaser shall have from time to
time specified to the Company in writing for such purpose, without the
presentation or surrender of such Note or the making of any notation thereon,
except that upon written request of the Issuers made concurrently with or
reasonably promptly after payment or prepayment in full of any Note, such
Purchaser shall surrender such Note for cancellation, reasonably promptly after
any such request, to the Company at its principal executive office or at the
place of payment most recently designated by it pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior
to any sale or other disposition of any Note held by any Purchaser or its
nominee such Purchaser will, at its election, either endorse thereon the amount
of principal paid thereon and the last date to which interest has been paid
thereon or surrender such Note to the Issuers in exchange for a new Note or
Notes pursuant to Section 13.2. The Issuers will afford the benefits of this
Section 14.2 to any Institutional Investor that is the direct or indirect
transferee of any Note purchased by any Purchaser under this Agreement and that
has made the same agreement relating to such Note as such Purchaser has made in
this Section 14.2.

15. EXPENSES, ETC.

      15.1. TRANSACTION EXPENSES.

      Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Issuers will pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees of a special counsel and, if
reasonably required, local or other counsel) incurred by each Purchaser or
holder of a Note in

                                      -48-

<PAGE>

connection with such transactions and in connection with any amendments, waivers
or consents under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Financing
Document (whether or not such amendment, waiver or consent becomes effective),
including, without limitation: (a) the costs and expenses incurred in enforcing
or defending (or determining whether or how to enforce or defend) any rights
under this Agreement or any other Financing Document or in responding to any
subpoena or other legal process or informal investigative demand issued in
connection with this Agreement or any other Financing Document, or by reason of
being a holder of any Note, and (b) the costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, financial advisors' and accountants' fees, incurred in connection
with the insolvency or bankruptcy of either of the Issuers or any Subsidiary or
in connection with any work-out or restructuring of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Notes. The Issuers will pay, and will save each
Purchaser and each other holder of a Note harmless from, all claims in respect
of any fees, costs or expenses if any, of brokers and finders (other than those
retained by any Purchaser).

      The Issuers will promptly pay or reimburse each Purchaser or holder of a
Note (upon demand, in accordance with each such Purchaser's or holder's written
instructions) for all fees and costs paid or payable by such Purchaser or holder
to the SVO in connection with the initial filing of this Agreement and all
related documents and financial information, and all subsequent annual and
interim filings of documents and financial information related to this
Agreement, with the SVO or any successor organization acceding to the authority
thereof.

      15.2. SURVIVAL.

      The joint and several obligations of the Issuers under this Section 15
will survive the payment or transfer of any Note, the enforcement, amendment or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Financing Document, and
the termination of this Agreement.

16. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

      All representations and warranties contained herein shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Financing
Documents, the purchase or transfer by any Purchaser of any Note or portion
thereof or interest therein and the payment of any Note, and may be relied upon
by any subsequent holder of a Note, regardless of any investigation made at any
time by or on behalf of such Purchaser or any other holder of a Note. All
statements contained in any certificate or other instrument delivered by or on
behalf of any Obligor pursuant to any Financing Document shall be deemed
representations and warranties of the Issuers under this Agreement. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement and the other Financing Documents embody
the entire agreement

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

and understanding among each Purchaser and the Obligors and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof.

17. AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

      17.1. REQUIREMENTS.

      This Agreement and the Notes may be amended, and the observance of any
term hereof or of the Notes may be waived (either retroactively or
prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the Issuers and the
Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 21 hereof, or any defined term (as it
is used therein), will be effective as to each Purchaser unless consented to by
each Purchaser in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver may, without the
written consent of the holder of each Note at the time outstanding affected
thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12 relating to acceleration or
rescission, change the amount or time of any prepayment or payment of principal
of, or change the rate or the time of payment or method of computation of
interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the Notes, (ii) change the percentage
of the principal amount of the Notes the holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment or waiver, or (iii) amend any of Sections 8,
11(a), 11(b), 12, 17 or 20.

      17.2. SOLICITATION OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

            (a) Solicitation. The Issuers will provide each holder of the Notes
      (irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with sufficient
      information, sufficiently far in advance of the date a decision is
      required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered
      decision with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in
      respect of any of the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The Issuers will
      deliver executed or true and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or
      consent effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section 17 to each
      holder of outstanding Notes promptly following the date on which it is
      executed and delivered by, or receives the consent or approval of, the
      requisite holders of Notes.

            (b) Payment. Neither Issuer will directly or indirectly pay or cause
      to be paid any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional
      interest, fee or otherwise, or grant any security, to any holder of Notes
      as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any
      holder of Notes or any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and
      provisions hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or
      security is concurrently granted, on the same terms, ratably to each
      holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did not consent to
      such waiver or amendment.

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

      17.3. BINDING EFFECT, ETC.

      Any amendment or waiver consented to as provided in this Section 17
applies equally to all holders of Notes and is binding upon them and upon each
future holder of any Note and upon each of the Issuers without regard to whether
such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment or waiver. No such
amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation, covenant,
agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived or impair
any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between either Issuer and the
holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights hereunder or under any
Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any holder of such Note. As used
herein, the term "THIS AGREEMENT" and references thereto shall mean this
Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

      17.4. NOTES HELD BY THE ISSUERS, ETC.

      Solely for the purpose of determining whether the holders of the requisite
percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding approved
or consented to any amendment, waiver or consent to be given under this
Agreement or the Notes, or have directed the taking of any action provided
herein or in the Notes to be taken upon the direction of the holders of a
specified percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then
outstanding, Notes directly or indirectly owned by either of the Issuers or any
of its Affiliates shall be deemed not to be outstanding.

18. NOTICES.

      All notices and communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
and sent (i) by telecopy if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy
of such notice by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (charges
prepaid), or (ii) by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested
(postage prepaid), or (iii) by a nationally recognized overnight delivery
service (with charges prepaid). Any such notice must be sent:

            (a) if to a Purchaser or its nominee, to such Purchaser or its
      nominee at the address specified for such communications in Schedule A, or
      at such other address as such Purchaser or its nominee shall have
      specified to the Issuers in writing,

            (b) if to any other holder of any Note, to such holder at such
      address as such other holder shall have specified to the Company in
      writing, or

            (c) if to the Company, to the Company at its address set forth at
      the beginning hereof to the attention of Joe Caporaso at fax number
      404-845-

                                      -51-

<PAGE>

      3127, or at such other address as the Company shall have specified to the
      holder of each Note in writing; or

            (d) if to the Co-Issuer, to the Co-Issuer at the address specified
      in clause (c) above (or such other address as the Co-Issuer shall have
      specified to the holder of each Note in writing).

Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given only when actually received.

19. REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

      This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without
limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) Financing Documents and documents received by each Purchaser at
the Closing (except the Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements,
certificates and other information previously or hereafter furnished to each
Purchaser, may be reproduced by each Purchaser by any photographic, photostatic,
microfilm, microcard, miniature photographic or other similar process and each
Purchaser may destroy any original document so reproduced. The Issuers agree and
stipulate that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any such reproduction
shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any judicial or
administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in existence and
whether or not such reproduction was made by each Purchaser in the regular
course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further reproduction of
such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This Section 19
shall not prohibit the Issuers or any other holder of Notes from contesting any
such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the original, or from
introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such reproduction.

20. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

      For the purposes of this Section 20, "CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION" means
information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of either of the Issuers
or any Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or
otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was
clearly marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by
such Purchaser as being confidential information of the Issuers or such
Subsidiary, provided that such term does not include information that (a) was
publicly known or otherwise known to such Purchaser prior to the time of such
disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission
by such Purchaser or any Person acting on its behalf, (c) otherwise becomes
known to such Purchaser other than through disclosure by the Issuers or any
Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser
under Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. Each Purchaser will
maintain the confidentiality

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures adopted by such
Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential information of third parties
delivered to it, provided that such Purchaser may deliver or disclose
Confidential Information to (i) its directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such disclosure reasonably relates to
the administration of the investment represented by its Notes), (ii) its
financial advisors and other professional advisors who agree to hold
confidential the Confidential Information substantially in accordance with the
terms of this Section 20, (iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any
Institutional Investor to which such Purchaser sells or offers to sell such Note
or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such Person has agreed in
writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 20), (v) any Person from which such Purchaser offers
to purchase any Security of either Issuer (if such Person has agreed in writing
prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 20), (vi) any federal or state regulatory authority
having jurisdiction over such Purchaser, (vii) the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization, or any nationally
recognized rating agency that requires access to information about such
Purchaser's investment portfolio or (viii) any other Person to which such
delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance
with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in
response to any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection with any
litigation to which such Purchaser is a party or (z) if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent such Purchaser may reasonably
determine such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the
enforcement or for the protection of the rights and remedies under such
Purchaser's Notes and this Agreement. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance
of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to
the benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On
reasonable request by the Issuers in connection with the delivery to any holder
of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this
Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to
this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with
the Issuers embodying the provisions of this Section 20.

21. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

      Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute, prior to the Closing,
any one of its Affiliates as the purchaser of the Notes that such Purchaser has
agreed to purchase hereunder, by written notice to the Issuers, which notice
shall be signed by such Purchaser and such Affiliate, shall contain such
Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a
confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy with respect to it of the
representations set forth in Section 6 as to such Affiliates and an affirmation
of the acknowledgment contained in such Notes. Upon

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

receipt of such notice, wherever the word "Purchaser" is used in this Agreement
(other than in this Section 21), such word shall be deemed to refer to such
Affiliate in lieu of such original Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate
is so substituted as a purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter
transfers to such Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such Affiliate in
accordance with Section 13.2, upon the effectiveness of such transfer, wherever
the word "Purchaser" is used in this Agreement (other than in this Section 21),
such word shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer
to the original Purchaser, and such Purchaser shall have all the rights of an
original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.

22. MISCELLANEOUS.

      22.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

      All covenants and other agreements contained in this Agreement by or on
behalf of any of the parties hereto bind and inure to the benefit of their
respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any subsequent
holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.

      22.2. PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS.

      Anything in this Agreement or the Notes to the contrary notwithstanding,
any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest on any Note that is
due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in the computation of
the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day.

      22.3. SEVERABILITY.

      Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law) not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

      22.4. CONSTRUCTION.

      Each covenant contained herein shall be construed (absent express
provision to the contrary) as being independent of each other covenant contained
herein, so that compliance with any one covenant shall not (absent such an
express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse compliance with any other
covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action to be taken by any Person,
or which such Person is

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action
is taken directly or indirectly by such Person.

      22.5. COUNTERPARTS.

      This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be an original but all of which together shall constitute one
instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies hereof, each
signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties hereto.

      22.6. JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS.

      EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY NOTE OR OTHER
FINANCING DOCUMENT, OR ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO EXECUTE OR OTHERWISE ENFORCE
ANY JUDGMENT IN RESPECT OF ANY BREACH THEREOF, BROUGHT BY ANY HOLDER OF A NOTE
AGAINST ANY OBLIGOR OR ANY OF ITS PROPERTY, MAY BE BROUGHT BY SUCH HOLDER OF A
NOTE IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
