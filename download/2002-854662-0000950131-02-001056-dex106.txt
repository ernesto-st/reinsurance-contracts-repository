                                CREDIT AGREEMENT

Harris Trust and Savings Bank
Chicago, Illinois

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     The undersigned, MAF Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
applies to you (the "Lender") for your commitment, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof and on the basis of the representations and warranties
hereinafter set forth, to extend credit to the Company, all as more fully
hereinafter set forth.

Section 1. The Credits.

     Section 1.1. Revolving Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the Lender agrees to extend a revolving credit (the "Revolving Credit") to the
Company which may be availed of by the Company from time to time during the
period from and including the date hereof to but not including the Revolving
Credit Termination Date, at which time the commitment of the Lender to extend
credit under the Revolving Credit shall expire. The Revolving Credit may be
utilized by the Company in the form of Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of
Credit, all as more fully hereinafter set forth, provided that the aggregate
principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit outstanding at
any one time shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitment. During the period
from and including the date hereof to but not including the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, the Company may use the Revolving Credit Commitment by
borrowing, repaying and reborrowing Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part
and/or by having the Lender issue Letters of Credit, having such Letters of
Credit expire or otherwise terminate without having been drawn upon or, if drawn
upon, reimbursing the Lender for each such drawing, and having the Lender issue
new Letters of Credit, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, where a determination of the unused
or available amount of the Revolving Credit Commitment is necessary, the
Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit shall be deemed to utilize the
Revolving Credit Commitment in an amount equal to the outstanding principal
amounts thereof.

     Section 1.2. Revolving Credit Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Revolving Credit may be availed of by the Company in the form of
loans (individually a "Revolving Credit Loan" and collectively the "Revolving
Credit Loans"). Each Revolving Credit Loan shall be in an amount of $500,000 or
such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000; provided,
however, that a Revolving Credit Loan, or part thereof, which bears interest
with reference to the Adjusted LIBOR shall be in such greater amount as is
required by Section 2.2 hereof. All Revolving Credit Loans made by the Lender
shall be made against and evidenced by a single Revolving Credit Note of the
Company (the "Revolving Credit Note") payable to the order of the Lender in the
amount of its Revolving Credit Commitment, with the Revolving Credit Note to be
in the form (with appropriate insertions) attached hereto as Exhibit A. The
Revolving Credit Note shall be dated the date of issuance thereof, be expressed
to bear interest as set forth in Section 2 hereof, and be expressed to mature

<PAGE>

on the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Without regard to the principal amount
of the Revolving Credit Note stated on its face, the actual principal amount at
any time outstanding and owing by the Company on account thereof shall be the
sum of all advances then or theretofore made thereon less all payments of
principal actually received.

     Section 1.3. Letters of Credit.

     (a) General Terms. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Revolving Credit may be availed of by the Company in the form of standby letters
of credit issued by the Lender for the account of the Company or, at the
Company's option, for the account of the Company and MAF Developments (and any
joint venture in which MAF ~Developments is a partner), jointly and severally
(individually a "Letter of Credit" and collectively the "Letters of Credit"),
provided that the aggregate amount of Letters of Credit issued and outstanding
hereunder shall not at any time exceed $20,000,000. For purposes of this
Agreement, a Letter of Credit shall be deemed outstanding as of any time in an
amount equal to the maximum amount which could be drawn thereunder under any
circumstances and over any period of time plus any unreimbursed drawings then
outstanding with respect thereto. If and to the extent any Letter of Credit
expires or otherwise terminates without having been drawn upon, the availability
under the Revolving Credit Commitment shall to such extent be reinstated.

     (b) Term. Each Letter of Credit issued hereunder shall expire not later
than 18 months from the date of issuance (or be cancelable not later than 18
months from the date of issuance and each renewal); provided, however, that for
any Letter of Credit with an expiry date extending beyond the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, the Company hereby agrees to (i) deposit cash with the Lender
on or before the Revolving Credit Termination Date in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of such Letter of Credit or (ii) deposit with the Lender on or
before the Revolving Credit Termination Date investments in direct obligations
of the United States of America or of any agency or instrumentality thereof
whose obligations constitute full faith and credit obligations of the United
States of America in amounts and with such maturities as are acceptable to the
Lender, in each case to be held by the Lender in the Account referred to in
Section 8.4 hereof as collateral security for any and all Obligations pursuant
to the terms of Section 8.4 hereof, provided that if the amount of any such
Letter of Credit is thereafter reduced, and so long as no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, at the request of the Company, the
Lender will immediately return any cash or investments in the Account, and any
proceeds or earnings on such cash and investments, in excess of the remaining
amount of such Letter of Credit.

     (c) General Characteristics. Each Letter of Credit issued hereunder shall
be payable in U.S. Dollars, conform to the general requirements of the Lender
for the issuance of standby letters of credit as to form and substance, and be a
letter of credit which the Lender may lawfully issue.

     (d) Applications. At the time the Company requests each Letter of Credit to
be issued (or prior to the first issuance of a Letter of Credit in the case of a
continuing application), the Company shall execute and deliver to the Lender an
application for such Letter of Credit in the form then customarily prescribed by
the Lender (individually an "Application" and collectively the "Applications").
Subject to the other provisions of this subsection, the obligation of the

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

Company to reimburse the Lender for drawings under a Letter of Credit shall be
governed by the Application for such Letter of Credit. Anything contained in the
Applications to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the event the Lender is not
reimbursed by the Company for the amount the Lender pays on any drawing made
under a Letter of Credit issued hereunder by 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the
date when such drawing is paid, the obligation of the Company to reimburse the
Lender for the amount of such drawing shall bear interest (which the Company
hereby promises to pay on demand) from and after the date the draft is paid
until payment in full thereof at a fluctuating rate per annum determined by
adding 2.0% to the Base Rate as from time to time in effect (computed on the
basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed), (ii) the
Company shall pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit as set forth in
Section 3 hereof, (iii) except during the existence of a Default or an Event of
Default, the Lender will not call for additional collateral security for the
obligations of the Company under the Applications except as otherwise provided
in Section 1.3(b) hereof, and (iv) except during the existence of a Default or
an Event of Default, the Lender will not call for the funding of a Letter of
Credit by the Company prior to being presented with a drawing thereunder (or, in
the event the drawing is a time draft, prior to its due date) except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.3(b) hereof.

     (e) Change in Laws. If the Lender shall determine that any change in any
applicable law, regulation or guideline (including, without limitation,
Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or any new
law, regulation or guideline, or any interpretation of any of the foregoing by
any governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any
central bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority having jurisdiction
over the Lender (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

          (i)   impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
     or similar requirement against the Letters of Credit, or the Lender's or
     the Company's liability with respect thereto; or

          (ii)  impose on the Lender any  penalty  with  respect to the
     foregoing or any other condition regarding this Agreement, the Applications
     or the Letters of Credit;

and the Lender shall determine that the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to the
Lender of issuing or maintaining the Letters of Credit hereunder (without
benefit of, or credit for, any prorations, exemptions, credits or other offsets
available under any such laws, regulations, guidelines or interpretations
thereof), then the Company shall pay on demand to the Lender from time to time
as specified by the Lender such additional amounts as the Lender shall determine
are sufficient to compensate and indemnify it for such increased cost. If the
Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide the Company a
certificate setting forth the computation of the increased cost as a result of
any event mentioned herein in reasonable detail and such certificate shall be
conclusive if reasonably determined (absent manifest error).

     Section 1.4. Term Credit. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Lender agrees to make a loan (the "Term Loan") to the Company in an amount up to
the Lender's Term Loan Commitment. There shall be a single borrowing under the
Term Loan Commitment which shall be made, if at all, on or before December 10,
2001, at which time the commitment of the Lender

                                      -3-

<PAGE>

to make the Term Loan under the Term Loan Commitment shall expire. There shall
be one borrowing under the Term Loan Commitment, and any portion of the Term
Loan Commitment not requested by the Company on the occasion of such borrowing
shall thereupon expire. The Term Loan made by the Lender to the Company shall be
evidenced by a Term Note of the Company (the "Term Note") payable to the order
of the Lender in the amount of its Term Loan Commitment, with the Term Note to
be in the form (with appropriate insertions) attached hereto as Exhibit B. The
Term Note shall be dated the date of issuance thereof and be expressed to bear
interest as set forth in Section 2 hereof. The Company hereby promises to make
principal payments on the Term Note in installments on the dates set forth in
column A below each in an amount equal to the amount set forth in column B below
opposite the relevant due date:

         The Company hereby agrees to repay the balance of the Term Loan in the
amounts and on the dates set fourth below:

                A                                     B

           12/31/2005                            $8,000,000
           12/31/2006                            $8,000,000
           12/31/2007                            $11,000,000
           12/31/2008               $11,000,000 or such lesser amount
                                    representing the remaining principal
                                          balance of the Term Loan

     Section 1.5. Manner and Disbursement of Loans. The Company shall give
written or telephonic notice to the Lender (which notice shall be irrevocable
once given) by no later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date the Company
requests that any Loan be made to it under the Commitments. Each such notice
shall specify the date of the Loan requested (which must be a Business Day), the
type of Loan being requested, and the amount thereof. Each Loan shall initially
constitute part of the applicable Base Rate Portion except to the extent the
Company has otherwise timely elected that such Loan, or any part thereof,
constitute part of a LIBOR Portion as provided in Section 2 hereof. The Company
agrees that the Lender may rely upon any written or telephonic notice given by
any person the Lender in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative
without the necessity of independent investigation and, in the event any
telephonic notice conflicts with any written confirmation, such telephonic
notice shall govern if the Lender has acted in reliance thereon. Subject to the
provisions of Section 6 hereof, the proceeds of each Loan shall be made
available to the Company at the principal office of the Lender in Chicago,
Illinois, in immediately available funds.

                                      -4-

Section 2.     Interest and Change in Circumstances.

     Section 2.1. Interest Rate Options.

     (a)  Portions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2,
portions of the principal indebtedness evidenced by the Notes (all of the
indebtedness evidenced by Notes of the same type bearing interest at the same
rate for the same period of time being hereinafter referred to as a "Portion")
may, at the option of the Company, bear interest with reference to the Base Rate
("Base Rate Portions") or with reference to the Adjusted LIBOR ("LIBOR
Portions"). Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 2, the Base Rate
Portion or LIBOR Portions of Notes of the same type may be converted from time
to time from one basis to the other. All of the indebtedness evidenced by a Note
which is not part of a LIBOR Portion shall constitute a single Base Rate Portion
applicable to such Note. All of the indebtedness evidenced by a Note which bears
interest with reference to a particular Adjusted LIBOR for a particular Interest
Period shall constitute a single LIBOR Portion applicable to such Note. There
shall not be more than five LIBOR Portions applicable to the Revolving Credit
Note outstanding at any one time. There shall be not more than seven LIBOR
Portions applicable to the Term Note outstanding at any one time. Anything
contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligation of the Lender
to create, continue or effect by conversion any LIBOR Portion shall be
conditioned upon the fact that at the time no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing. The Company hereby promises to pay interest on
each Portion at the rates and times specified in this Section 2.

     (b)  Base Rate Portion. Each Base Rate Portion shall bear interest at the
rate per annum determined equal to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time
plus the Applicable Base Rate Margin, provided that if a Base Rate Portion or
any part thereof is not paid when due (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or
otherwise), or at the election of the Lender upon notice to the Company after
the occurrence and during the continuation of any other Event of Default, such
Portion shall bear interest, whether before or after judgment, until payment in
full of the amount then due at the rate per annum determined by adding 2.0% to

last day of each March, June, September and December in each year and at
maturity of the applicable Note, and interest after maturity (whether by lapse
of time, acceleration or otherwise) shall be due and payable upon demand. Any
change in the interest rate on the Base Rate Portions resulting from a change in
the Base Rate shall be effective on the date of the relevant change in the Base
Rate.

     (c)  Libor Portions. Each LIBOR Portion shall bear interest for each
Interest Period selected therefor at a rate per annum determined by adding the
Applicable LIBOR Margin to the Adjusted LIBOR for such Interest Period, provided
that if any LIBOR Portion is not paid when due (whether by lapse of time,
acceleration or otherwise), or at the election of the Lender upon notice to the
Company after the occurrence and during the continuation of any other Event of
Default, such Portion shall bear interest, whether before or after judgment,
until payment in full of the amount then due through the end of the Interest
Period then applicable thereto at the rate per annum determined by adding 2.0%
to the interest rate which would otherwise be applicable thereto, and effective
at the end of such Interest Period such LIBOR Portion shall automatically be

at the interest rate applicable to such Base Rate Portion. Interest on each
LIBOR Portion shall be due and payable on the last day of each Interest Period
applicable thereto, and, with respect to any LIBOR Portion with an Interest
Period in excess of three months, on the last day of every three-month period
following the first day of such Interest Period and on the last day of such
Interest Period, and interest after maturity (whether by lapse of time,
acceleration or otherwise) shall be due and payable upon demand. The Company
shall notify the Lender on or before 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the third
Business Day preceding the end of an Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR
Portion whether such LIBOR Portion is to continue as a LIBOR Portion, in which
event the Company shall notify the Lender of the new Interest Period selected
therefor, and in the event the Company shall fail to so notify the Lender, such
LIBOR Portion shall automatically be converted into and added to the applicable
Base Rate Portion as of and on the last day of such Interest Period.

     Section 2.2. Minimum LIBOR Portions. Each LIBOR Portion applicable to the
Revolving Credit Note shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000 or such greater
amount which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000, and each LIBOR Portion

which the Company requests that any LIBOR Portion be created or that any part of
the applicable Base Rate Portion be converted into a LIBOR Portion (each such
notice to specify in each instance the amount thereof and the Interest Period
selected therefor). If any request is made to convert a LIBOR Portion into the
relevant Base Rate Portion hereunder, such conversion shall only be made so as
to become effective as of the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto. All requests for the creation, continuance and conversion of LIBOR
Portions under this Agreement shall be irrevocable. Such requests may be written
or oral and the Lender is hereby authorized to honor telephonic requests for
creations, continuances and conversions received by it from any person the
Lender in good faith believes to be an Authorized Representative without the
necessity of independent investigation, the Company hereby indemnifying the
Lender from any liability or loss ensuing from so acting.

     Section 2.5. Change of Law. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement or any Note, if at any time the Lender shall determine that any change
in applicable laws, treaties or regulations or in the interpretation thereof
makes it unlawful for the Lender to create or continue to maintain any LIBOR
Portion, it shall promptly so notify the Company and the obligation of the
Lender to create, continue or maintain any such LIBOR Portion under this
Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for the Lender to
create, continue or maintain such LIBOR Portion. The Company, on demand, shall,
if the continued maintenance of any such LIBOR Portion is unlawful, thereupon
prepay the outstanding principal amount of the affected LIBOR Portion, together
with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts payable to the Lender
with respect thereto under this Agreement; provided, however, that the

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

Company may elect to convert the principal amount of the affected LIBOR Portion
into the relevant Base Rate Portion hereunder, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

     Section 2.6. Unavailability of Deposits or Inability to Ascertain Adjusted
LIBOR. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any Note, if
prior to the commencement of any Interest Period, the Lender shall determine
that deposits in the amount of any LIBOR Portion scheduled to be outstanding
during such Interest Period are not readily available to the Lender in the
relevant market or, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market,
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining Adjusted LIBOR, then
the Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Company and the obligation
of the Lender to create, continue or effect by conversion any such LIBOR Portion
in such amount and for such Interest Period shall be suspended until deposits in
such amount and for the Interest Period selected by the Company shall again be
readily available in the relevant market and adequate and reasonable means exist
for ascertaining Adjusted LIBOR.

     Section 2.7. Taxes and Increased Costs. With respect to any LIBOR Portion,
if the Lender shall determine that any change in any applicable law, treaty,
regulation or guideline (including, without limitation, Regulation D of the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) or any new law, treaty,
regulation or guideline, or any interpretation of any of the foregoing by any
governmental authority charged with the administration thereof or any central
bank or other fiscal, monetary or other authority having jurisdiction over the
Lender or its lending branch or the LIBOR Portions contemplated by this
Agreement (whether or not having the force of law), shall:

               (i) impose, increase, or deem applicable any reserve, special
     deposit or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits in
     or for the account of, or loans by, or any other acquisition of funds
     or disbursements by, the Lender which is not in any instance already
     accounted for in computing the interest rate applicable to such LIBOR
     Portion;

              (ii) subject the Lender, any LIBOR Portion or a Note to the
     extent it evidences any LIBOR Portion to any tax (including, without
     limitation, any United States interest equalization tax or similar tax
     however named applicable to the acquisition or holding of debt
     obligations and any interest or penalties with respect thereto), duty,
     charge, stamp tax, fee, deduction or withholding in respect of this
     Agreement, any LIBOR Portion or a Note to the extent it evidences any
     LIBOR Portion, except such taxes as may be measured by the overall net
     income or gross receipts of the Lender or its lending branches and
     imposed by the jurisdiction, or any political subdivision or taxing
     authority thereof, in which the Lender's principal executive office or
     its lending branch is located;

             (iii) change the basis of taxation of payments of principal and
     interest due from the Company to the Lender hereunder or under a Note
     to the extent it evidences any LIBOR Portion (other than by a change in
     taxation of the overall net income or gross receipts of the Lender or
     its lending branches); or

                                      -7-

<PAGE>

                (iv) impose on the Lender any penalty with respect to the
       foregoing or any other condition regarding this Agreement, any LIBOR
       Portion, or a Note to the extent it evidences any LIBOR Portion;

and the Lender shall determine that the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost (whether by incurring a cost or adding to a cost) to the
Lender of creating or maintaining any LIBOR Portion hereunder or to reduce the
amount of principal or interest received or receivable by the Lender (without
benefit of, or credit for, any prorations, exemption, credits or other offsets
available under any such laws, treaties, regulations, guidelines or
interpretations thereof), then the Company shall pay on demand to the Lender
from time to time as specified by the Lender the additional amounts as the
Lender shall reasonably determine are sufficient to compensate and indemnify it
for such increased cost or reduced amount. If the Lender makes such a claim for
compensation, it shall provide to the Company a certificate setting forth the
computation of the increased cost or reduced amount as a result of any event
mentioned herein in reasonable detail and such certificate shall be conclusive
if reasonably determined (absent manifest error).

       Section 2.8.  Funding Indemnity. In the event the Lender shall incur any
loss, cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss (including loss
of profit), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
re-employment of deposits or other funds acquired or contracted to be acquired
by the Lender to fund or maintain its part of any LIBOR Portion or the relending
or reinvesting of such deposits or other funds or amounts paid or prepaid to the
Lender) as a result of:

                (i)  any payment of a LIBOR Portion on a date other than the
       last day of the then applicable Interest Period for any reason, whether
       before or after default, and whether or not such payment is required by
       any provisions of this Agreement; or

                (ii) any failure by the Company to create, borrow, continue or
       effect by conversion a LIBOR Portion on the date specified in a notice
       given pursuant to this Agreement;

then, upon the demand of the Lender, the Company shall pay to the Lender such
amount as will reimburse the Lender for such loss, cost or expense. If the
Lender requests such reimbursement under this Section, it shall provide to the
Company a certificate setting forth the computation of the loss, cost, or
expense giving rise to the request for reimbursement in reasonable detail and
such certificate shall be conclusive if reasonably determined (absent manifest
error).

       Section 2.9. Lending Branch. The Lender may, at its option, elect to
make, fund or maintain the Loans hereunder at the branches or offices specified
on the signature pages hereof or at such of its branches or offices as the
Lender may from time to time elect.

       Section 2.10. Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Lender
shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of the
Notes in any manner it sees fit (provided the same is in accordance with this
Agreement), it being understood, however, that for purposes of this Agreement
all determinations hereunder with respect to LIBOR Portions (including, without

                                      -8-

<PAGE>

limitation, determinations under Sections 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 hereof) shall be made
as if the Lender had actually funded and maintained each LIBOR Portion during
each Interest Period applicable thereto through the purchase of deposits in the
relevant market in the amount of such LIBOR Portion, having a maturity
corresponding to such Interest Period, and bearing an interest rate equal to the
LIBOR for such Interest Period.

and including the date hereof, to but not including the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, the Company shall pay to the Lender a facility fee at the rate
of .10% per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual
number of days elapsed) on the average daily Revolving Credit Commitment in
effect during such time (whether or not in use). Such facility fee shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September, and
December in each year and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date unless the
Revolving Credit Commitment is terminated in whole on an earlier date, in which
event the facility fee for the period to the date of such termination in whole
shall be paid on the date of such termination.

     (b) Letter of Credit Fees. On the date of issuance of each Letter of
Credit, and as condition thereto, and annually thereafter, the Company shall pay

(computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days
elapsed) on the maximum amount of the related Letter of Credit which is
scheduled to be outstanding during the immediately succeeding twelve (12)
months. In addition to the letter of credit fee called for above, the Company

Portion, in an amount not less than $1,000,000, and (iii) in each case, in an

the Lender (such notice if received subsequent to 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on a
given day to be treated as though received at the opening of business on the
next Business Day), by paying to the Lender the principal amount to be prepaid
and (i) if such a prepayment prepays the Term Note in whole or in part, accrued
interest thereon to the date of prepayment, (ii) if such a prepayment prepays
the Revolving Credit Note in full and is accompanied by the termination in whole
of the Revolving Credit Commitment, accrued interest and facility fees thereon
to the date of prepayment, and (iii) any amounts due to the Lender under Section
2.8 hereof.

     Section 3.3. Mandatory Termination. After the occurrence of a Change of
Control, the Lender may, by written notice to the Company at any time on or
before the date occurring 120 days after the date the Company notifies the
Lender of such Change of Control, terminate the remaining Commitments and all
other obligations of the Lender hereunder on the date stated in such notice
(which shall in no event be sooner than 120 days after the occurrence of such
Change of Control). On the date the Commitments are so terminated, all
outstanding Obligations (including, without limitation, all principal of and
accrued interest on the Notes) shall forthwith be due and payable without
further demand, presentment, protest, or notice of any kind and the Company
shall immediately pay to the Lender the full amount then available for drawing
under each Letter of Credit, such amount to be held in the Account referred to
in Section 8.4 hereof (the Company agreeing to immediately make such payment on
the date the Commitments are so terminated and acknowledging and agreeing that
the Lender would not have an adequate remedy at law for the failure by the
Company to honor any such demand and that the Lender shall have the right to
require the Company to specifically perform such undertaking whether or not any
drawings or other demands for payment have been made under any Letter of
Credit).

     Section 3.4. Voluntary Terminations. The Company shall have the right at
any time and from time to time, upon 1 Business Day prior notice to the Lender,
to terminate without premium or penalty and in whole or in part (but if in part,
then in an aggregate amount not less than $1,000,000 or such greater amount
which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000) the Revolving Credit Commitment,
provided that the Revolving Credit Commitment may not be reduced to an amount
less than the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans and
Letters of Credit then outstanding. Any termination of the Revolving Credit
Commitment pursuant to this Section may not be reinstated.

     Section 3.5. Place and Application of Payments. All payments of principal,
interest, fees and all other Obligations payable hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents shall be made to the Lender at its office at 111 West Monroe
Street, Chicago, Illinois (or at such other place as the Lender may specify), on
the date any such payment is due and payable. Payments received by the Lender
after 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) shall be deemed received as of the opening of
business on the next Business Day. All such payments shall be made in lawful
money of the United States of America, in immediately available funds at the
place of payment, without set-off or counterclaim and without reduction for, and
free from, any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
charges, deductions, withholdings, restrictions and conditions of any nature
imposed by any government or any political subdivision or taxing authority
thereof (but excluding any taxes imposed on or measured by the net income of the
Lender). No amount paid or prepaid on the Term Note may be reborrowed, and
partial prepayments of the Term Note shall be applied in the order of their
scheduled maturities. Unless the Company otherwise directs, principal payments
of a Note shall be first applied to the Base Rate Portion until payment in full
thereof, with any balance applied to the relevant LIBOR Portions in the order in
which their Interest Periods expire.

     Section 3.6. Notations. Each Loan made against a Note, the status of all
amounts evidenced by a Note as constituting part of the Base Rate Portion or a
LIBOR Portion, and, in the case of any LIBOR Portion, the rates of interest and
Interest Periods applicable to such Portions shall be recorded by the Lender on
its books and records or, at its option in any instance, endorsed on a schedule
to its Note and the unpaid principal balance and status, rates

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

and Interest Periods so recorded or endorsed by the Lender shall, absent
manifest error, be prima facie evidence in any court or other proceeding brought
to enforce such Note of the principal amount remaining unpaid thereon, the
status of the Loan or Loans evidenced thereby and the interest rates and
Interest Periods applicable thereto; provided that the failure of the Lender to
record any of the foregoing shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligation
of the Company to repay the principal amount of each Note together with accrued
interest thereon. Prior to any negotiation of a Note, the Lender shall record on
a schedule thereto the status of all amounts evidenced thereby as constituting
part of the applicable Base Rate Portion or a LIBOR Portion and, in the case of
any LIBOR Portion, the rates of interest and the Interest Periods applicable
thereto.

Section 5.   Representations and Warranties.

     At the time the Company requests the initial extension of credit under this
Agreement and at all times thereafter in accordance with Section 6.1 hereof, the
Company represents and warrants to the Lender as follows:

     Section 5.1.   Organization and Qualification. The Company is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing as a corporation under the laws
of the State of Delaware, has full and adequate corporate power to own its
Property and conduct its business as now conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the nature of the Property owned or leased by it
requires such licensing or qualifying, except where the failure to so qualify
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, Properties,
business or operations of the Company. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company is a savings and loan holding company and, as such, the
Company has received all necessary approvals from, and has filed all necessary
reports with, all applicable federal and state regulatory authorities, except
where the failure to do so will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, Properties, business, or operations of the Company.

     Section 5.2.   Subsidiaries. Each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
incorporated or organized, as the case may be, has full and adequate power to
own its Property and conduct its business as now conducted, and is duly licensed
or qualified and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it or the nature of the Property owned or leased by it
requires such licensing or qualifying, except where the failure to so qualify
will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, Properties,
business or operations of such Subsidiary. Schedule 5.2 hereto identifies each
Subsidiary, the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, as the case
may be, the percentage of issued and outstanding shares of each class of its
capital stock or other equity interests owned by the Company and the
Subsidiaries and, if such percentage is not 100% (excluding directors'
qualifying shares as required by law), a description of each class of its
authorized capital stock and other equity interests and the number of shares of
each class issued and outstanding, in each case after giving effect to the
Merger. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity
interests of each Subsidiary are validly issued and outstanding and fully paid
and nonassessable and all such shares and other equity interests indicated on
Schedule 5.2 as owned by the Company or a Subsidiary are or will be owned
immediately after giving effect to the Merger, beneficially and of record, by
the Company or such Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. There are no
outstanding commitments or other obligations of any Subsidiary to issue, and no
options, warrants or other rights of any Person to

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

acquire, any shares of any class of capital stock or other equity interests of
any Subsidiary, except as disclosed on Schedule 5.2 hereof.

     Section 5.3.   Corporate Authority and Validity of Obligations. The Company
has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, to make the borrowings herein provided for, to issue its Notes in
evidence thereof, and to perform all of its obligations hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents. The Loan Documents delivered by the Company have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and constitute valid and
binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms
except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity (regardless of whether the application of such principles
is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents do not, nor does the performance or observance by the
Company of any of the matters and things herein or therein provided for,
contravene or constitute a default under any provision of law or any judgment,
injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company or any provision of the
charter, articles of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any material
covenant, indenture or agreement of or affecting the Company or any of its
Properties, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any Property
of the Company.

     Section 5.4.   Use of Proceeds; Margin Stock. The Company shall use the
proceeds of (i) the Revolving Credit Loans and Letters of Credit made available
hereunder to acquire land for development in the ordinary course of business,
for general working capital purposes and to finance the Mid Town Bancorp
Acquisition and (ii) the Term Loan, to finance the Mid Town Bancorp Acquisition,
and to refinance existing indebtedness owing by the Company to the Lender. No
part of the proceeds of any Revolving Credit Loan or Letter of Credit made
hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any margin stock (within the meaning
of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), or to
extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such
margin stock. No part of the proceeds of the Term Loan will be used to purchase
or carry any margin stock (as defined above), or to extend credit to others for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying any such margin stock, in violation of
such Regulation U. After giving effect to the Merger, margin stock (as defined
above) constitutes less than 25% of those assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other
restriction hereunder.

     Section 5.5.   Financial Reports. (a) The consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, and the related
consolidated statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows of the

results of their operations and cash flows as of the dates of such statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
basis, subject to year-end audit adjustments in the case of interim financial

     (c) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has contingent liabilities which

material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) or business
prospects of Mid Town and its subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     Section 5.7.   Full Disclosure. The statements and information furnished to
the Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and the commitments by the Lender to provide all or part of the
financing contemplated hereby do not contain any untrue statements of a material
fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the material statements contained

projections furnished to the Lender, the Company only represents that the same
were prepared on the basis of information and estimates the Company believed to
be reasonable.

     Section 5.8.   Good Title. The Company and its Subsidiaries each have good
and defensible title to their assets as reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to the
Lender (except for assets and Properties disposed of in the ordinary course of
business and assets subject to Liens which, individually and in the aggregate,
do not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, Properties,
business or operations of the Company or any Subsidiary) and, in the case of
assets consisting of stock or other equity interests in Subsidiaries, subject to
no Liens.

     Section 5.9.   Litigation and Other Controversies. There is no litigation
or governmental proceeding or labor controversy pending, nor to the knowledge of
the Company threatened, against the Company or any Subsidiary which if adversely
determined would (a) impair the validity or enforceability of, or impair the

other Loan Document or (b) result in any material adverse change in the
financial condition, Properties, business or operations of the Company or any
Subsidiary.

or any Subsidiary in any jurisdiction have, in fact, been filed, and all taxes,

Properties, income or franchises, which are shown to be due and payable in such
returns, have been paid, except for taxes, assessments, fees and other
governmental charges being contested in good faith and for which adequate
reserves therefor have been established on the books of the Company or any
Subsidiary, as applicable. The Company does not know of any proposed additional
tax assessment against it or its Subsidiaries under applicable tax laws in
effect at the time this representation is made or deemed made for which adequate
provision in accordance with GAAP has not been made on its accounts. Adequate
provisions in accordance with GAAP for taxes on the books of the Company and
each Subsidiary have been made for all open years, and for its current fiscal
period.

preserve and keep in force and effect all licenses, permits and franchises
necessary to the proper conduct of its business; provided, however, that nothing

closing or sale is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of
its business and is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Lender.

discharge, and shall cause each Subsidiary to duly pay and discharge, all taxes,
rates, assessments, fees and governmental charges upon or against it or its

balances, properties and any investments from time to time held therein, and any
substitutions for such account, any certificate of deposit or other instrument
evidencing any of the foregoing and all proceeds of and earnings on any of the
foregoing being collectively called the "Account") as security for, and for

remaining amounts held in the Account.

Section 9.  Miscellaneous.

which is not a Business Day, interest on such principal amount shall continue to
accrue during such extension at the rate per annum then in effect, which accrued
amount shall be due and payable on the next scheduled date for the payment of
interest.

     Section 9.2. No Waiver, Cumulative Remedies. No delay or failure on the
part of the Lender or on the part of any holder of any of the Obligations in the
exercise of any power or right shall operate as a waiver thereof or as an
acquiescence in any default, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
power or right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

                                      -34-

and in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and in
connection with any consents hereunder or waivers or amendments hereto or

expenses (including court costs and attorneys' fees), if any, incurred or paid
by the Lender in connection with any Default or Event of Default or in

trustee for the Lender harmless from any and all liabilities, losses, costs and
expenses incurred by the Lender, or any such security trustee, in connection
with any action, suit or proceeding brought against the Lender, or any such
security trustee, by any Person which arises out of the transactions
contemplated or financed hereby or out of any action or inaction by the Lender
or any such security trustee hereunder or thereunder, except for such thereof as
is caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking to
be indemnified. The provisions of this Section and the protective provisions of
Section 2 hereof shall survive payment of the Obligations.

extensions of credit shall in any manner relieve the Lender of its obligations
hereunder.

Harris Trust and Savings Bank
111 West Monroe Street
Chicago, Illinois  60603

         Re:   MAF Bancorp, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel to MAF Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), in connection with that certain Credit Agreement of even date
herewith (the "Credit Agreement"), between the Company and Harris Trust and
Savings Bank (the "Bank"), an Illinois banking corporation (referred to herein
as the "Transaction"). This Opinion Letter is furnished to you at the request of
the Company pursuant to Section 6.2(c) of the Credit Agreement.
                        -------------

This Opinion Letter is governed by, and shall be interpreted in accordance with,
the Legal Opinion Accord (the "Accord") of the ABA Section of Business Law
(1991). As a consequence, it is subject to a number of qualifications,
exceptions, definitions, limitations on coverage and other limitations, all as
more particularly described in the Accord, including but not limited to, the
assumptions contained in (S).4 of the Accord and the General Qualifications (as
defined in the Accord), and this Opinion Letter should be read in conjunction
therewith. The law covered by the opinions expressed herein is limited to the
Federal Law of the United States and the Law of the State of Illinois. Unless
otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Accord.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications, assumptions and
limitations set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

         1. The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the State of Delaware and is a registered savings and loan
holding company under the Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, as
amended.

         2. The Company has adequate corporate power and authority to conduct
its business as it is now being conducted.

         3. The execution and delivery by the Company of the documents set
forth on Exhibit A hereto (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") and the
         ---------
performance by the Company of its agreements under such documents have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the Company.

         4. The Transaction Documents have been duly executed by the Company and
are enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective terms.

         5. No approval, consent or authorization of, or filing with, any
governmental agency or authority of the United States of America or the State of
Illinois, is required on the part of the Company to make valid and legally
binding the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the
Transaction Documents, except for approvals, consents, authorizations and
filings already obtained or made.

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

        6.  The execution and delivery by the Company of the Transaction
Documents, and the performance by the Company of its agreements under such
documents, do not (a) violate the Company's Constituent Documents, (b) assuming
the proper pay-off and termination of the prior Credit Agreement dated as of May
26, 1996 between the Company and the Bank in accordance with the terms of this
Transaction, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or result in the
creation of any lien, security interest or other encumbrance upon any material
agreement or instrument Actually Known to us to which the Company is a party or
by which any of its properties is bound, (c) breach or otherwise violate any
existing obligation of the Company under any material decree or order of the
United States of America or the State of Illinois Actually Known to us to which
the Company is a party or in which it is named, or (d) violate applicable
provisions of statutory law or regulation.

        7.  The Company is not an "investment company" or an "affiliated person"
of or "promoter" or "principal underwriter" for, an "investment company", as
such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
execution of the Term Note (as defined in the Credit Agreement), the application
of the proceeds thereof by the Company as provided in the Credit Agreement, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement will
not result in any violation by the Company of any provision of such Act or any
rule, regulation or order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission
thereunder.

        8.  Assuming that the Company applies the proceeds of the Loans (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) as provided in the Credit Agreement, the Loans
will not violate the provisions of Regulations U and X of the Federal Reserve
Board.

        The General Qualifications, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Exception,
the Equitable Principles Limitations and the Other Common Qualifications apply
to the opinion set forth in paragraph 4.

        We hereby confirm to you that, based solely upon a review of our
litigation docket, there are no actions or proceedings against the Company,
pending or overtly threatened in writing, before any court, governmental agency
or arbitrator which (i) seek to affect the enforceability of the Transaction
Documents, or (ii) could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business or financial condition of the Company.

        This Opinion Letter may be relied upon by you only in connection with
the Transaction and may not be used or relied upon by you or any other person
for any purpose whatsoever, except to the extent authorized in the Accord,
without in each instance our prior written consent.

                                               Very truly yours,

                                               Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz

     2. Mid America Investment Services, Inc. ("MAIS") has recorded on its books
as of October 31, 2001, an amount of $6,075,925 classified as A/P-Other. This
relates to a property MAIS sold in 2000 (which had previously been REO of the
Bank and had been contributed to MAIS), under an agreement in which the buyer
assumed an industrial revenue bond obligation in the amount of $6,000,000. Mid
America has issued a letter of credit guaranteeing the repayment of the IRB
obligation and this letter of credit remains outstanding. Because Mid America
provided an additional loan to the buyers for tenant improvements and remains
contingently liable relative to the IRB obligation (pursuant to the letter of
credit), for GAAP purposes, MAIS could not record this transaction as a sale.
MAIS was required to keep the liability (including the deferred profit on the
sale of approximately $83,000) on its books as well as the asset relating to the
property of $6,000,872 (recorded as A/R-Other)
