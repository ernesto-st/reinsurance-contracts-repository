collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the US Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders,
an amount in cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date <U>plus</U> any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon; <U>provided</U> that (i)&nbsp;the portions of such amount attributable to undrawn
Canadian Dollar Letters of Credit or LC Disbursements in Canadian Dollars that the US Borrower is
not late in reimbursing shall be deposited in Canadian Dollars in the actual amounts of such
undrawn Letters of Credit and LC Disbursements and (ii)&nbsp;the obligation to deposit such cash
collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable in US Dollars, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event
of Default with respect to the US Borrower described in Section&nbsp;8.05. For the purposes of this
paragraph, the Canadian Dollar LC Exposure shall be calculated using the Spot Exchange Rate on the
date that notice demanding cash collateralization is delivered to the US Borrower. Each such
deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of
the obligations of the US Borrower under this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall have
exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made
at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the US Borrower&#146;s risk and
expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments
shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative
Agent to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer for LC Disbursements for which it has not been
reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the
reimbursement obligations of the US Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity
of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of US Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the US Borrower under this Agreement. If the US Borrower is required to provide an
amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such
amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the US Borrower within three
Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the US Borrower is
