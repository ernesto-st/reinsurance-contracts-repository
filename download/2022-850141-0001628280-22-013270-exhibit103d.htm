Capitalized terms  not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the meanings assigned to them in the Plan.     1. General.  By accepting the grant of the PBRSUs and SBRSUs, you agree to be bound by all of the terms and  provisions of this Agreement and the Plan (as presently in effect or later amended), the terms of which are incorporated  herein by this reference, the rules and regulations under the Plan adopted from time to time, and any interpretations,  decisions and determinations the Compensation Committee of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;) or  its delegate may make from time to time.  If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the  provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan govern.        2. Account for You as Employee Grantee.  The Company shall maintain a bookkeeping account for you (the  &#8220;Account&#8221;) reflecting the number of PBRSUs and SBRSUs granted hereunder, and adjusted for any Dividend  Equivalents or other adjustments to the PBRSUs and SBRSUs or any settlement or forfeiture thereof.    3. Settlement in General; Six-month Delay for Specified Employees.  Settlement of PBRSUs and SBRSUs for  which no valid deferral election is in effect shall be made in shares of Stock as soon as practicable following the date  such PBRSUs and SBRSUs vest and become nonforfeitable, except as provided in Paragraph 5.  Settlement of  PBRSUs and SBRSUs for which a valid deferral election is in effect shall be made in shares of Stock in accordance  with such deferral election. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph 3, if you are a Specified  Employee on the date of Separation from Service, any PBRSUs and SBRSUs subject to Section 409A of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986 becoming subject to settlement on account of Separation from Service shall not be settled  earlier than the first day of the seventh month following your Separation from Service, or if earlier, the date of your  death or disability.    4. Nontransferability and Other Limitations.  Except as otherwise permitted under the Plan, until PBRSUs and/or  SBRSUs have been settled, you may not transfer the PBRSUs and/or SBRSUs or any rights relating thereto to any  third party other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  Sales of shares of Stock delivered in settlement  of PBRSUs and SBRSUs will be subject to any Company policy regulating trading by employees.  Additional events  could result in forfeiture or loss of the PBRSUs and SBRSUs.    5. Separation from Service; Death, Disability, Retirement; Change in Control  Except as provided below in this  Paragraph 5, if you have a Separation from Service for any reason, prior to satisfying the PBRSU and/or SBRSU Grant  Requirements set forth on the preceding  Designations pages, any unvested PBRSUs and/or SBRSUs shall thereupon  be forfeited immediately.     (a) Death or Disability.      (i) PBRSUs.

You will be &#8220;disabled&#8221; for purposes of this  Paragraph 5(a) if you have a disability (as determined under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A- 3(i)(4)).     (ii) SBRSUs.  If you die or incur a disability (determined in the manner described below), your unvested  SBRSUs shall thereupon become vested and no longer subject to forfeiture immediately and shall be  settled in accordance with the terms on the preceding Designations pages under &#8220;Settlement&#8221; and  Paragraph 3 hereof. The determination of disability under the Company&#8217;s long-term disability policy  applicable to you (or which would be applicable if you had elected coverage) shall govern whether  you are considered to have incurred a disability.    (b) Retirement.      (i) PBRSUs.  If you Retire (as defined below) at least one year after the Grant Date and prior to the  expiration of the Performance Period, the number of your earned PBRSUs shall be a pro rata portion  of the number of PBRSUs that would have been earned if you had remained employed throughout the  Performance Period, determined based on actual performance, which PBRSUs shall be vested and  nonforfeitable and shall be settled at the expiration of the Performance Period, subject to Paragraph  5(a)  above, in accordance with the terms on the preceding Designations pages under &#8220;Settlement&#8221; and  Paragraph 3 hereof.  The pro rata portion of such earned PBRSUs shall be determined by multiplying  the number of PBRSUs that would have been earned times the Proration Fraction (as defined above).   If you Retire less than one year after the Grant Date, your PBRSUs shall be forfeited.  You shall be  deemed to have &#8220;Retired&#8221; upon Separation from Service (this excludes separating from employment  due to death, disability, or for Cause (as defined in Section 11.03 of the Plan)) on or after the earlier of  (x) your attainment of 65 years of age and at least 5 years of service with the Company or (y) your  attainment of age 55 and at least 10 years of service with the Company.      (ii) SBRSUs. If you Retire (as defined above) one year or more after the Grant Date, a portion of your  unvested SBRSUs shall thereupon become vested and no longer subject to forfeiture, and shall be  settled in accordance with the terms on the preceding Designations pages under &#8220;Settlement&#8221; and  Paragraph 3 hereof.  The portion that vests when you Retire shall be determined by (x) multiplying the  number of SBRSUs granted (as shown on the Designations page) by a fraction, the numerator of  which is the number of months elapsed since the Grant Date (for example, if the Grant Date is March  15, one month elapses as of the 14th of each subsequent month) and the denominator of which is 36,  and then (y) subtracting the number of SBRSUs that became vested prior to the date you Retired.  If  you Retire less than one year after the Grant Date, your unvested SBRSUs shall be forfeited.      (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all PBRSUs and SBRSUs shall be forfeited in the event of a  termination of service for Cause (as defined in Section 11.03 of the Plan).    (c) Change in Control.      (i) PBRSUs. If on or after the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 3.08(b) of the  Plan), but prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of the Change in Control and prior to the  expiration of the Performance Period, you (x) have an involuntary Separation from Service the  Company other than for Cause (as defined in Section 11.03 of the Plan) and other than on account of  death or disability (as provided in Paragraph 5(a)), or (y) have a voluntary termination for Good  Reason (as defined below), then any unearned PBRSUs shall be deemed earned at the Target level and  shall be immediately vested and no longer subject to forfeiture, and shall be settled in accordance with  the terms on the preceding Designations pages under &#8220;Settlement&#8221; and Paragraph 3 hereof.

The employer shall have 30 days to cure the event constituting Good Reason and you  shall terminate employment upon the lapse of the cure period if no cure is effected.    6. Dividend Equivalents and Adjustments.      (a) Dividend Equivalents.  Dividend Equivalents will be credited on PBRSUs and SBRSUs (other than PBRSUs  and SBRSUs that, at the relevant record date, previously have been settled or forfeited) and deemed reinvested in  additional PBRSUs and SBRSUs, as applicable.  Such crediting shall be as follows, except that the Committee, in  its discretion, may vary the crediting medium (for example, by crediting cash dividend equivalents rather than  additional PBRSUs and SBRSUs for administrative convenience), and Dividend Equivalents so credited will be  distributed or settled when the underlying Account is settled:    (i) Cash Dividends.  If the Company declares and pays a dividend or distribution on Stock in the form of  cash, then additional PBRSUs and SBRSUs, as applicable, shall be credited to your Account (in lieu  of payment or crediting of cash dividend equivalents) in a number equal to the number of PBRSUs  and SBRSUs credited to the Account as of the relevant record date multiplied by the amount of  cash  paid per share in such dividend or distribution divided by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock at  the payment date for such dividend or distribution.    (ii) Non-Stock Dividends.  If the Company declares and pays a dividend or distribution on Stock in the  form of property other than shares of Stock, then a number of additional PBRSUs and SBRSUs, as  applicable, shall be credited to your Account as of the payment date for such dividend or distribution  in a number equal to the number of PBRSUs and SBRSUs credited to the Account as of the record  date for such dividend or distribution multiplied by the fair market value of such property actually paid  as a dividend or distribution on each outstanding share of Stock at such payment date, divided by the  Fair Market Value of a share of Stock at such payment date.    (iii)   Stock Dividends and Splits.  If the Company declares and pays a dividend or distribution on Stock in  the form of additional shares of Stock, or there occurs a forward split of Stock, then a number of  additional PBRSUs and SBRSUs, as applicable, shall be credited to your Account as of the payment  date for such dividend or distribution or forward split equal to the number of PBRSUs and SBRSUs  credited to the Account as of the record date for such dividend or distribution or split multiplied by the  number of additional shares of Stock actually paid as a dividend or distribution or issued in such split  in respect of each outstanding share of Stock.    </FONT></DIV>

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the preceding paragraphs shall be construed to limit your  right, if any, under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act and/or other applicable laws to  discuss the terms and conditions of your employment or to engage in protected concerted activity as  defined by law.  In addition, nothing in the preceding paragraphs shall be construed to prohibit you  from first (or later) reporting, or assisting in the reporting or investigation, of possible violations of  federal or state law or regulation to any governmental agency or self-regulatory organization, or  making other disclosures that reasonably may be protected under whistleblower or other provisions of  any applicable federal or state law or regulation.

Miscellaneous.    (a) Binding Agreement; Written Amendments.  This Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, executors,  administrators and successors of the parties.  The Plan, this Agreement and any deferral election relating to the  PBRSUs and SBRSUs constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the PBRSUs and  SBRSUs, and supersede any prior agreements or understandings with respect to the PBRSUs and SBRSUs.  No  amendment or alteration of this Agreement which may impose any additional obligation upon the Company shall  be valid unless expressed in a written instrument duly executed in the name of the Company, and no amendment,  alteration, suspension or termination of this Agreement which materially impairs your rights with respect to the  PBRSUs and SBRSUs shall be valid unless expressed in a written instrument executed by you.  Any amendment,  alteration, suspension or termination required by law or the terms of any Agreement to which the Company is a  party, or necessary to preserve or improve the tax status of the PBRSUs and SBRSUs for you shall be deemed not  to materially impair your rights with respect to the PBRSUs and SBRSUs.    (b) No Promise of Continued Employment.  The PBRSUs and SBRSUs and the granting thereof shall not  constitute or be evidence of any agreement or understanding, express or implied, that you have a right to continue  as an officer or employee of the Company for any period of time, or at any particular rate of compensation.    (c) Recoupment.  All rights granted and/or shares of Stock delivered under this Agreement are subject to  recoupment under the Company&#8217;s recoupment policy as in effect from time to time.

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, at the time the PBRSUs and  SBRSUs become subject to tax, the Company will withhold from any shares deliverable in settlement of the  PBRSUs and SBRSUs (or if the PBRSUs and SBRSUs become subject to tax prior to the settlement date, the  Company will reduce the number of PBRSUs and SBRSUs in your Account), in accordance with Section 12.06 of  the Plan, the number of whole shares of Stock having a value nearest to, but not exceeding, the amount of income  and employment taxes required to be withheld under applicable laws and regulations, and pay the amount of such  withholding taxes in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities.  You will be responsible for any withholding taxes  not satisfied by means of such mandatory withholding and for all taxes in excess of such withholding taxes that  may be due with respect to the PBRSUs and SBRSUs upon vesting or settlement or otherwise.     (g)  Unfunded Obligations.  The grant of the PBRSUs and SBRSUs and the maintenance of your Account shall be  by means of bookkeeping entries on the books of the Company and shall not create for you any right to, or claim  against any, specific assets of the Company, nor result in the creation of any trust or escrow account for you.  With  respect to your entitlement to any distribution hereunder, you shall be a general creditor of the Company.     (h) Notices.  Any notice to be given the Company under this Agreement shall be addressed to the Company at its  principal executive offices, in care of the Chief Human Resources Officer, and any notice to you shall be  addressed to you at your address as then appearing in the records of the Company.    (i) No Shareholder Rights.  You and any Beneficiary shall not have any rights with respect to Stock (including  voting rights) covered by this Agreement prior to the settlement of the PBRSUs and SBRSUs and distribution of  the shares of Stock as specified herein.     Effective: March 9, 2022    </FONT></DIV>
