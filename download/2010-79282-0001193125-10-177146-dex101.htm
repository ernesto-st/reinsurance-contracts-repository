granting the Company preliminary injunctive relief and shall continue uninterrupted for the next succeeding two (2)&nbsp;years. The Employee acknowledges that the purposes of this <B>Section&nbsp;8</B> would be frustrated by measuring the period of
restriction from the date of termination of employment where the Employee failed to honor the Agreement until directed to do so by court order. </FONT></P>
