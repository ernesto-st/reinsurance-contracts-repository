<U><LI>Losses</U>. Losses for each Taxable Year shall be allocated the Members in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.</LI>
<U><LI>Special Rules</U>.  Notwithstanding Sections 7.1(a) and (b), the following special allocation rules shall apply under the circumstances described:</LI>
<OL TYPE="i">

<U><LI>Limitation on Loss Allocations</U>.  The Losses allocated to any Member pursuant to Section 7.1(b) with respect to any Taxable Year shall not exceed the maximum amount of Losses that can be so allocated without causing such Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of such Taxable Year.  All Losses in excess of the limitation set forth in this Section 7.1(c)(i) shall be allocated first, to the Member who will not be subject to this limitation, and second, any remaining amount to the Members in the manner required by the Code and the Regulations.  If any Loss is allocated pursuant to this Section 7.1(c)(i), then the Members receiving such Loss allocation shall be specially allocated to the extent available items of Company income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in proportion to and to the extent of such Loss allocations.</LI>
<U><LI>Company Minimum Gain</U>.  Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f), if there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Company taxable period, each Member shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in proportion to and to the extent of, an amount equal to the portion of such Member's share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain, determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(g).  This Section 7.1(c)(ii) is intended to comply with the charge back of items of income and gain requirement in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.</LI>
<U><LI>Minimum Gain Attributable to Member  Nonrecourse Debt</U>.  Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Minimum Gain Attributable to Member Nonrecourse Debt during any Company taxable period, each Member with a share of Minimum Gain Attributable to Member Nonrecourse Debt shall be specially allocated items of Company income and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in proportion to, and to the extent of, an amount equal to the portion of such Member's share of the net decrease in the Minimum Gain Attributable to Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4).  This Section 7.1(c)(iii) is intended to comply with the charge back of items of income and gain requirement in Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.</LI>
<U><LI>Qualified Income Offset</U>.  In the event any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)<I>(d)(4),(5)</I> or <I>(6)</I>, and such adjustment, allocation or distribution causes or increases an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit for such Member, then before any other allocations are made under this Agreement or otherwise, such Member shall be allocated  items of Company income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of Company income, including gross income and gain) in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Regulations, such Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Member as quickly as possible.</LI>
<U><LI>Nonrecourse Deductions</U>.  Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated in accordance with each Member's Percentage Interest.  If the Board of Directors determines in its good faith discretion that the Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the Board of Directors is authorized, upon notice to the  Members, to revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy such requirements.</LI>
<U><LI>Member Nonrecourse Deductions</U>.  Member Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Member that bears the economic risk of loss (as defined in Regulations Section 1.704-2(b) with respect to the Member Nonrecourse Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)).  If more than one Member bears the economic risk of loss with respect to a Member Nonrecourse Debt, such Member Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among such Members in accordance with the ratios in which they share such economic risk of loss.</LI>
<U><LI>Curative Allocations</U>.  The allocations set forth in Sections 7.1(c)(i) through 7.1(c)(vi) (the "<U>Regulatory Allocations</U>") are intended to comply with certain requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2(b).  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 7.1(c) (other than the Regulatory Allocations), the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such allocations of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Member shall be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.</LI>
<U><LI>Change in Regulations</U>.  If the Regulations incorporating the Regulatory Allocations are hereafter changed or if new Regulations are hereafter adopted, and such changed or new Regulations, in the opinion of independent tax counsel for the Company, make it necessary to revise the Regulatory Allocations or provide further special allocation rules in order to avoid a significant risk that a material portion of any allocation set forth in this Article VII would not be respected for federal income tax purposes, the Board of Directors shall make such reasonable amendments to this Agreement as, in the opinion of such counsel, are necessary or desirable, taking into account the interests of the Members as a whole and all other relevant factors, to avoid or reduce significantly such risk to the extent possible without materially changing the amounts allocable and distributable to any Member, pursuant to this Agreement.</LI>
<U><LI>Non-Recourse Liabilities</U>.  "Excess non-recourse liabilities" of the Company within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3) shall be allocated pro rata.</LI>
<U><LI>Gross Income Allocations</U>.  If any fee or compensation payable from the Company to a Member is treated as a distribution for income tax purposes, there shall be allocated to the recipient Member items of gross income equal to the amount of such payment in the year in which such payment is made or in the first succeeding year in which the Company realizes income.  </LI>
<U><LI>Liquidating Allocations.</U>  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, (i) upon a sale of substantially all of the Company's assets outside the ordinary course of business or (ii) upon a liquidation of the Company, to the extent available, the Company shall first allocate Profits or Losses (or to the extent necessary and available, gross income, gain, deduction or loss) in the Taxable Year, and, if necessary, the immediately preceding Taxable Year, of such event among the Members in a manner such that distributions pursuant to Article X hereof would be made in a manner which is consistent with the manner in which such distributions would otherwise be made pursuant to Article VI hereof.</LI></OL>

With respect to depreciation, amortization or other cost recovery deductions, for example, in determining the taxable income allocable to a Member, Profits and Losses allocable to that Member shall be adjusted by eliminating Depreciation allocable to that Member and substituting therefor tax depreciation, amortization or other cost recovery deduction allocable to that Member determined by reference to that Member's share of the tax basis of Company assets. This Section 7.2(b)(i) is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 704(c) and Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)<I>(f)</I> and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.  Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall be made by the Board of Directors in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement.</LI>
<U><LI>Allocation of Items Among Members</U>.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2(b)(i), each item of income, gain, loss and deduction and all other items governed by Code Section 702(a) shall be allocated among the Members in proportion to the allocation of Profits, Losses and other items to the Members hereunder, provided that any gain recognized from any disposition of a Company asset that is treated as ordinary income because it is attributable to the recapture of any depreciation or amortization shall be allocated among the Members in the same ratio as the prior allocations of Profits, Losses and other items that included such depreciation or amortization, but not in excess of the gain otherwise allocable to each Member.</LI></OL>

<U><LI>Conformity of Reporting</U>.&#9;The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations made by this Section 7.2 and hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this Section 7.2 in reporting their shares of Company profits, gains, income, losses, deductions, credits and other items for income tax purposes.</LI></OL>

No consent or waiver, express or implied, by any Member to or of any breach or default by any other Member in the performance by such other Member of its obligations under this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to be a consent to or waiver of any other breach or default in the performance by such other Member of the same or any other obligation of such other Member under this Agreement.  Failure on the part of any Member to complain of any act or failure to act of any other Member or to declare any other Member in default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by such Member of its rights under this Agreement.</LI>
