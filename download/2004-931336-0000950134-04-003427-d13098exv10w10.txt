                  shall be denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency,
                  (6) if such borrowing is denominated in Dollars, whether the
                  borrowing shall be comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans,
                  LIBOR Rate Loans or a combination thereof, and (7) if LIBOR
                  Rate Loans are requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor. A
                  form of Notice of Borrowing (a "Notice of Borrowing") is
                  attached hereto as Schedule 2.1(b)(i). If the Borrower shall
                  fail to specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an
                  applicable Interest Period in the case of a LIBOR Rate Loan,
                  then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for an
                  Interest Period of one month, (II) the Type of Revolving-1
                  Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
                  request for an Alternate Base Rate Loan, or (III) the
                  applicable portion for the Revolving-1 Loan requested, then
                  such notice shall be deemed to be a request for first, a
                  Dollar Revolving-1 Loan (up to the Dollar Revolving-1
                  Committed Amount), and then a Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loan
                  denominated in Dollars (up to the Multi-currency Revolving-1
                  Committed Amount). The Administrative Agent shall give notice
                  to each Lender promptly upon receipt of each Notice of
                  Borrowing, the contents thereof and each such Lender's share
                  thereof.

                           (ii) Advances of Revolving-1 Loans Denominated in
                  Dollars. Each Lender will make its Dollar Revolving-1
                  Commitment Percentage of each Dollar Revolving-1 Loan
                  borrowing, or its Multi-currency Revolving-1 Commitment
                  Percentage of each Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loan borrowing
                  denominated in Dollars, as applicable, available to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the
                  office of the Administrative Agent specified in Section 9.2,
                  or at such other office as the Administrative Agent may
                  designate in writing, by 4:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
                  time) on the date specified in the applicable Notice of
                  Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately available to the
                  Administrative Agent. Such borrowing will then be made
                  available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent by
                  crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of such
                  office with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
                  Administrative Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as
                  received by the Administrative Agent.

                           (iii) Advances of Alternative Currency Loans. Each
                  Lender will make its Multi-currency Revolving-1 Commitment
                  Percentage of the Alternative Currency Amount of each
                  Alternative Currency Loan borrowing available to the
                  Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the
                  office of the Administrative Agent's Correspondent specified

                  Agent may designate in writing, by 11:00 A.M. (the time of the
                  Administrative Agent's Correspondent) on the date specified in
                  the applicable Notice of Borrowing in the Alternative Currency
                  of the Alternative Currency Loan to be made and in funds
                  immediately available to the Administrative Agent. Such
                  borrowing will then be made available to the Borrower by the
                  Administrative Agent by crediting the account of the Borrower
                  on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts
                  made available to the Administrative Agent by the Lenders and
                  in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (c) Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving-1 Loans
         shall be due and payable in full, in the currency in which each
         Revolving-1 Loan was initially funded, on the Revolving-1 Commitment
         Termination Date.

                  (d) Revolving-1 Notes. Each Lender's Revolving-1 Loans may, at
         the election of such Lender, of the Borrower to such Lender in the
         original amount of such Lender's Revolving-1 Commitment and in

         SECTION 2.2 SWINGLINE LOAN SUBFACILITY

                  (a) Swingline Commitment. During the Commitment Period,
         subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender, in
         its individual capacity, agrees to make certain revolving credit loans
         to the Borrower (each a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the
         "Swingline Loans") for the purposes hereinafter set forth; provided,
         however, (i) the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any
         time shall not exceed ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ($100,000,000) (the
         "Swingline Committed Amount"), and (ii) the sum of the aggregate amount
         of outstanding Dollar Revolving-1 Loans plus Swingline Loans plus
         Dollar LOC Obligations shall not exceed the Dollar Revolving-1
         Committed Amount. Swingline Loans hereunder may be repaid and
         reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

                  (b) Swingline Loan Borrowings.

                           (i) Notice of Borrowing and Disbursement. The
                  Swingline Lender will make Swingline Loans available to the
                  Borrower on any Business Day upon request made by the Borrower
                  not later than 4:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on
                  such Business Day. A request for a Swingline Loan borrowing
                  shall be made in the form of a Notice of Borrowing with
                  appropriate modifications. Swingline Loan borrowings hereunder
                  shall be made in minimum amounts of $100,000 and integral
                  multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof.

                           (ii) Repayment of Swingline Loans. Each Swingline
                  Loan borrowing shall be due and payable on or before the fifth
                  Business Day after the date on which such Swingline Loan
                  borrowing is made or such later date to which the Swingline
                  Lender and Borrower agree and, in any event, on the Maturity
                  Date. The Swingline Lender may, at any time, in its sole
                  discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans
                  by way of a Dollar Revolving-1 Loan borrowing, in which case
                  the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Dollar
                  Revolving-1 Loan borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate
                  Base Rate Loans in the amount of such Swingline Loans;
                  provided, however, that, in the following circumstances, any
                  such demand shall also be deemed to have been given one
                  Business Day prior to each of (i) the Maturity Date, (ii) the
                  occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section
                  7.1(e), (iii) upon acceleration of the Credit Party
                  Obligations hereunder, whether on account of an Event of
                  Default described in Section 7.1(e)





                                       38
<PAGE>

                  or any other Event of Default, and (iv) the exercise of
                  remedies in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.2
                  hereof (each such Dollar Revolving-1 Loan borrowing made on
                  account of any such deemed request therefor as provided herein
                  being hereinafter referred to as a "Mandatory Borrowing").
                  Each Lender with a Dollar Revolving-1 Subcommitment hereby
                  irrevocably agrees to make such Dollar Revolving-1 Loans
                  promptly upon any such request or deemed request on account of
                  each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner
                  specified in the preceding sentence and on the same such date
                  notwithstanding (I) the amount of Mandatory Borrowing may not
                  comply with the minimum amount for borrowings of Dollar
                  Revolving-1 Loans otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether
                  any conditions specified in Section 4.2 are then satisfied,
                  (III) whether a Default or an Event of Default then exists,
                  (IV) failure of any such request or deemed request for Dollar
                  Revolving-1 Loans to be made by the time otherwise required in
                  Section 2.1(b)(i), (V) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing,
                  or (VI) any reduction in the Dollar Revolving-1 Committed
                  Amount or termination of the Dollar Revolving-1 Subcommitments
                  immediately prior to such Mandatory Borrowing or
                  contemporaneously therewith. In the event that any Mandatory
                  Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise
                  required above (including, without limitation, as a result of
                  the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code
                  with respect to the Borrower), then each Lender with a Dollar
                  Revolving-1 Subcommitment hereby agrees that it shall
                  forthwith purchase (as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing
                  would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
                  received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to
                  such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such participations
                  in the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to
                  cause each such Lender to share in such Swingline Loans
                  ratably based upon its respective Dollar Revolving-1
                  Commitment Percentage (determined before giving effect to any
                  termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2),
                  provided that (A) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans
                  shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until the
                  date as of which the respective participation is purchased,
                  and (B) at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to
                  this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be
                  required to pay to the Swingline Lender interest on the
                  principal amount of such participation purchased for each day
                  from and including the day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing
                  would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of
                  payment for such participation, at the rate equal to, if paid
                  within two (2) Business Days of the date of the Mandatory
                  Borrowing, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter at
                  a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (c) Interest on Swingline Loans. Subject to the provisions of
         Section 2.10(b), Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a per annum
         rate equal to the lesser of (i) the Alternate Base Rate plus the
         Applicable Percentage for Dollar Revolving-1 Loans that are Alternate
         Base Rate Loans or (ii) a rate agreed upon by the Swingline Lender and
         the Borrower. Interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable in arrears
         on each Interest Payment Date.

         of Schedule 2.2(d).

         thereto, in each case in an amount equal to its Dollar Revolving-1
         Commitment Percentage of the obligations under such Dollar Letter of
         Credit (including each Existing Letter of Credit) and shall absolutely,
         unconditionally and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as
         surety, and be obligated to pay to the applicable Issuing Lender

         Commitment Percentage of the obligations under such Multi-currency
         Letter of Credit and shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
         assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and be obligated to pay

         misconduct in issuing such Multi-currency Letter of Credit.

                           (iii) Without limiting the scope and nature of each
         Lender's participation in any Letter of Credit, to the extent that an
         Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as required hereunder or under
         any LOC Document, each such Lender shall pay to such Issuing Lender its

         same day funds on the day of notification by such Issuing Lender of an
         unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) below
         if such notice is received at or before 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North
         Carolina time), otherwise such payment shall be made at or before 12:00
         Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day next
         succeeding the day such notice is received. The obligation of each
         Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lenders shall be absolute and
         unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of a Default,
         an Event of Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such
         reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of
         the Borrower to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender under any
         Letter of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter provided.

                  (d) Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any
         Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall reimburse
         the applicable Issuing Lender on the day of drawing under any Letter of
         Credit (either with the proceeds of a Swingline Loan or Revolving-1
         Loan obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds in the
         applicable Permitted Currency in which such Letter of Credit was
         denominated, as provided herein or in the LOC Documents. If the
         Borrower shall fail to reimburse such Issuing Lender as provided
         herein, the unreimbursed Dollar Amount of such drawing shall bear
         interest at a per annum rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the
         Applicable Percentage. Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the
         applicable Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent of its intent to
         otherwise reimburse such Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall be deemed
         to have requested a Swingline Loan or Dollar Revolving-1 Loan (in the
         case of a Dollar Letter of Credit) or Multi-currency





                                       42

         Revolving-1 Loan (in the case of a Multi-currency Letter of Credit), in
         the Dollar Amount of the drawing as provided in subsection (e) below,
         the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the reimbursement
         obligations. The Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder shall
         be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of
         any rights of set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower
         may claim or have against any Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent,
         the Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any
         other Person, including, without limitation, any defense based on any
         failure of the Borrower to receive consideration or the legality,
         validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The
         applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify the applicable Lenders
         of the Dollar Amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each applicable
         Lender shall promptly pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
         of such Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds,
         the amount of such Lender's Dollar Revolving-1 Commitment Percentage or
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Commitment Percentage, as applicable, of
         such unreimbursed drawing, unless such Issuing Lender acted with gross
         negligence or willful misconduct in issuing such Letter of Credit. Such
         payment shall be made on the day such notice is received by such Lender
         from the Administrative Agent for the applicable Issuing Lender if such
         notice is received at or before 2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
         time), otherwise such payment shall be made at or before 12:00 Noon
         (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business Day next succeeding
         the day such notice is received. If such Lender does not pay such
         amount to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable
         Issuing Lender in full upon such request, such Lender shall, on demand,
         pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable
         Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period from the
         date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the
         Administrative, Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender
         in full at a rate per annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business
         Days of the date of drawing, the Federal Funds Effective Rate and
         thereafter at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate. Each Lender's
         obligation to make such payment to the Administrative Agent for the
         account of the applicable Issuing Lender, and the right of such Issuing
         Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall
         not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to
         the termination of this Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the
         existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the
         Credit Party Obligations hereunder and shall be made without any
         offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                  (e) Repayment with Revolving-1 Loans.

                           (i) Mandatory Dollar Borrowings. On any day on which
         the Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested,
         (A) a Swingline Loan borrowing to reimburse a drawing under a Dollar
         Letter of Credit, the Swingline Lender shall make the Swingline Loan
         advance pursuant to the terms of the request or deemed request in
         accordance with the provisions for Swingline Loan advances hereunder,
         or (B) a Dollar Revolving-1 Loan to

<PAGE>

         reimburse a drawing under a Dollar Letter of Credit, the Administrative
         Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Dollar Revolving-1 Loan
         has been requested or deemed requested in connection with a drawing
         under a Dollar Letter of Credit, in which case a Dollar Revolving-1
         Loan borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate Loans (each
         such borrowing, a "Mandatory Dollar Borrowing") shall be immediately
         made (without giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
         pursuant to Section 7.2) pro rata based on each Lender's respective
         Dollar Revolving-1 Commitment Percentage (determined before giving
         effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 7.2)
         and in the case of both clauses (A) and (B) the proceeds thereof shall
         be paid directly to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
         applicable Issuing Lender for application to the respective Dollar LOC
         Obligations.

                           (ii) Mandatory Multi-currency Borrowings. On any day
         on which the Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have
         requested, a Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loan to reimburse a drawing
         under a Multi-currency Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall
         give notice to the Lenders that a Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loan has
         been requested or deemed requested in connection with a drawing under a
         Multi-currency Letter of Credit, in which case a Multi-currency
         Revolving-1 Loan borrowing comprised entirely of Alternate Base Rate
         Loans in Dollars equal to the Dollar Amount of such drawing (each such
         borrowing, a "Mandatory Multi-currency Borrowing") shall be immediately
         made (without giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
         pursuant to Section 7.2) pro rata based on each Lender's respective
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Commitment Percentage (determined before
         giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section
         7.2) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender
         for application to the respective Multi-currency LOC Obligations.

                           (iii) Obligation Irrevocable. Each Lender hereby
         irrevocably agrees to make such Dollar Revolving-1 Loans or
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans, as applicable, pursuant to clauses
         (i) and (ii) above, immediately upon any such request or deemed request
         on account of each Mandatory Dollar Borrowing or Mandatory
         Multi-currency Borrowing, as applicable, in the amount and in the
         manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the same such date
         notwithstanding (i) the amount of such Mandatory Dollar Borrowing or
         Mandatory Multi-currency Borrowing, as applicable, may not comply with
         the minimum amount for borrowings of Dollar Revolving-1 Loans or
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans, as applicable, otherwise required
         hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 4.2 are
         then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of Default then
         exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed request for such
         Dollar Revolving-1 Loan or Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loan, as
         applicable, to be made by the time otherwise required in Section
         2.1(b), (v) the date of such Dollar Revolving-1 Loan or Mandatory
         Multi-currency Borrowing, as applicable, or (vi) any reduction in the
         Dollar Revolving-1 Committed Amount or Multi-currency Revolving-1
         Committed Amount, as applicable, after any such





                                       44
<PAGE>

         Dollar Revolving-1 Letter of Credit or Multi-currency Letter of Credit,
         as applicable, may have been drawn upon. In the event that any
         Mandatory Dollar Borrowing or Mandatory Multi-currency Borrowing cannot
         for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including,
         without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding
         under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each
         applicable Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith fund (as of the
         date the Mandatory Dollar Borrowing or Mandatory Multi-currency
         Borrowing, as applicable, would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted
         for any payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and
         prior to such purchase) its Participation Interests in the outstanding
         Dollar LOC Obligations or Multi-currency LOC Obligations, as
         applicable; provided, further, that in the event any Lender shall fail
         to fund its Participation Interest on the day the Mandatory Dollar
         Borrowing or Mandatory Multi-currency Borrowing, as applicable, would
         otherwise have occurred, then the amount of such Lender's unfunded
         Participation Interest therein shall bear interest payable to
         Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Lender
         upon demand, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days
         of such date, the Federal Funds Effective Rate, and thereafter at a
         rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (f) Designation of Subsidiaries as Account Parties.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
         including, without limitation, Section 2.3(a), a Letter of Credit
         issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that such Letter
         of Credit is issued for the account of a Subsidiary of the Borrower;
         provided that notwithstanding such statement, the Borrower shall be the
         actual account party for all purposes of this Agreement for such Letter
         of Credit and such statement shall not affect the Borrower's
         reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect to such Letter of
         Credit.

                  (g) Modification, Extension. The issuance of any supplement,
         modification, amendment, renewal, or extension to any Letter of Credit
         shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as the
         issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

                  (h) Uniform Customs and Practices. Unless otherwise agreed to
         by the applicable Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of
         Credit is issued, the applicable Issuing Lender shall have the Letters
         of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for
         Documentary Credits (the "UCP"), or the International Standby Practices
         1998 ("ISP"), in each case as published as of the date of issue by the
         International Chamber of Commerce, in which case the UCP or ISP, as
         applicable, may be incorporated therein and deemed in all respects to
         be a part thereof.

                  (i) Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict
         between this Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of
         credit application), this Agreement shall control. Each of the
         Reimbursement





                                       45
<PAGE>

         Agreements is and shall be deemed amended such that the representations
         and warranties covenants and events of default (and definitions related
         thereto) set out in each respective Reimbursement Agreement (the
         "Existing Provisions"), except to the extent they relate specifically
         to the relevant bonds or relevant remarketing program, conform with the
         representations and warranties, covenants and events of default (and
         definitions related thereto) set out in this Agreement (the
         "Incorporated Provisions"). So long as any obligations remain
         outstanding under the underlying revenue bonds related to any Letter of
         Credit or any documentation related thereto, such Incorporated
         Provisions shall survive (i) the payment in full of all obligations due
         the Lenders by the Borrower under this Agreement, (ii) the termination
         (for any reason) of this Agreement (iii) the sale or participation (in
         whole or in part) of a Lender's interest in this Agreement, or (iv) any
         other event which has an effect to terminate the obligations of the
         Borrower to the Lenders under this Agreement. Upon the happening of one
         of the events set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the
         Borrower agrees to promptly execute a modification of the relevant
         Reimbursement Agreements to confirm such amendment. Notwithstanding the
         preceding sentence or the failure of any such modification to be
         executed the Credit Parties to the extent applicable, must remain in
         compliance with the Incorporated Provisions as if set forth in each of
         the Reimbursement Agreement. Any future modification of or amendment to
         the Incorporated Provisions shall be a modification of or amendment to
         the relevant Reimbursement Agreements for purposes of compliance with
         such Reimbursement Agreements. Likewise, if the Required Lenders grant
         a waiver of compliance of the Incorporated Provisions for any period,
         such waiver shall be deemed to be a waiver of compliance of the
         relevant Reimbursement Agreements for the limited period of time for
         which the waiver was granted.

         SECTION 2.4 TRANCHE A-1 TERM LOAN FACILITY

         term loan in Dollars in an aggregate principal amount of NINE HUNDRED

         DOLLARS ($1,000,000,000), (the "Tranche A-1 Term Loan Committed
         Amount"); and the Tranche A-1 Term Loan may consist of Alternate Base
         Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, as the
         Borrower may request. LIBOR Rate Loans shall be made by each Lender at
         its LIBOR Lending Office and Alternate Base Rate Loans at its Domestic

                  (c) Tranche B-1 Term Notes. Each Lender's Tranche B-1 Term
         Loan Commitment Percentage of the Tranche B-1 Term Loan Committed
         Amount may, at the election of such Lender, of the Borrower to such
         Lender in substantially the form of Schedule 2.5(c).

         SECTION 2.6 FEES.

                  (a) Commitment Fee. In consideration of the Commitments, the
         Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
         benefit of the Lenders a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") in an
         amount equal to (1) with respect to the Tranche B-1 Term Loan Committed
         Amount, one-half percent (0.5%) per annum from the Closing Date until
         the Funding Date, and (2) with respect to the Tranche A-1 Term Loan
         Committed Amount and the Revolving-1 Committed Amount, from and after
         (A) the Closing Date until October 31, 2001, one-eighth percent (.125%)
         per annum on the Tranche A-1 Term Loan Committed Amount and the
         Revolving-1 Committed Amount and (B) November 1, 2001 until the Funding
         Date, one-quarter percent (.25%) per annum. After the Funding Date the
         Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (i) for the ratable
         benefit of the Lenders holding a Dollar Revolving-1 Subcommitment, a
         Commitment Fee equal to the Applicable Percentage per annum on the
         average daily unused amount of the Dollar Revolving-1 Committed Amount
         and (ii) for the ratable benefit of the Lenders holding a
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Subcommitment, a Commitment Fee equal to the
         Applicable Percentage per annum on the average daily unused amount of
         the Multi-currency Revolving-1 Committed Amount. For purposes of
         computing the Commitment Fee hereunder, (i) Dollar LOC Obligations
         shall be considered usage under the aggregate Dollar Revolving-1
         Committed Amount, (ii) Multi-currency LOC Obligations shall be
         considered usage under the aggregate Multi-currency Revolving-1
         Committed Amount and (iii) Swingline Loans shall not be considered
         usage under the aggregate Dollar Revolving-1 Committed Amount unless
         and until other Lenders having Dollar Revolving-1 Subcommitments
         purchase Participation Interests in such Swingline Loans pursuant to
         Section 2.2(b)(ii). The Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in
         arrears on the 15th day following the last day of each calendar quarter
         for the prior calendar quarter and upon termination of the Revolving-1
         Commitments and the funding of the Term Loans.

                  (b) Letter of Credit Fees. In consideration of the LOC
         Commitments, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Issuing Lender a fee
         (the "Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the Applicable Percentage per
         annum on the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under
         each Letter of Credit (as such amount may be increased subject to the
         provisions of Section 2.10(b)) from the date of issuance (or in the
         case of Letters of





                                       49
<PAGE>

         Credit outstanding on the Closing Date, from the Closing Date) to the
         date of expiration. In addition to such Letter of Credit Fee, the
         Issuing Lender may charge, and retain for its own account without
         sharing by the other Lenders, an additional facing fee of one-eighth of
         one percent (0.125%) per annum on the average daily maximum amount
         available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit issued by it.
         The Issuing Lender shall promptly pay over to the Administrative Agent
         the Letter of Credit Fee (i) for the ratable benefit of the Lenders
         (including the Issuing Lender, as applicable) holding Dollar
         Revolving-1 Subcommitments, with respect to Letter of Credit Fees paid
         on Dollar Letters of Credit, and (ii) for the ratable benefit of the
         Lenders (including the Issuing Lender, as applicable) holding
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Subcommitments, with respect to Letter of
         Credit Fees paid on Multi-currency Letters of Credit. The Letter of
         Credit Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the 15th day
         following the last day of each calendar quarter for the prior calendar
         quarter.

                  (c) Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the Letter of Credit
         Fees payable pursuant to subsection (b) above, the Borrower shall pay
         to the Issuing Lender for its own account without sharing by the other
         Lenders the reasonable and customary charges from time to time of the
         Issuing Lender with respect to the amendment, transfer, administration,
         cancellation and conversion of, and drawings under, such Letters of
         Credit (collectively, the "Issuing Lender Fees").

                  (d) Administrative Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
         Agents the annual administrative fee as described in the Fee Letter.

                  (e) The commissions, fees, charges, costs and expenses payable
         pursuant to this Section 2.6 shall be payable in the Permitted Currency
         in which the applicable Letter of Credit is denominated.

         SECTION 2.7 REDUCTION OF THE REVOLVING-1 COMMITMENTS

                  (a) Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower shall have the right to
         terminate or permanently reduce the unused portion of the Dollar
         Revolving-1 Committed Amount or the Multi-currency Revolving-1
         Committed Amount at any time or from time to time upon not less than
         one Business Day prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall
         notify the Lenders thereof as soon as practicable) of each such
         termination or reduction, which notice shall specify the effective date
         thereof and the amount of any such reduction which shall be in a
         minimum amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
         excess thereof and shall be irrevocable and effective upon receipt by
         the Administrative Agent; provided that no such reduction or
         termination shall be permitted if after giving effect thereto, and to
         any prepayments of Revolving-1 Loans made on the effective date
         thereof, (i) the sum of the then outstanding aggregate principal amount
         of Dollar Revolving-1 Loans plus Swingline Loans plus Dollar LOC
         Obligations would exceed the Dollar Revolving-1 Committed Amount or
         (ii) the then outstanding aggregate principal Dollar Amount of
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans plus the Dollar Amount of
         Multi-currency LOC Obligations would exceed the Multi-currency
         Revolving-1 Committed Amount. If the Borrower shall fail to specify in
         any such notice the





                                       50
<PAGE>

         applicable portion of the Revolving-1 Committed Amount to be reduced,
         then such reduction shall be applied pro rata to the Dollar Revolving-1
         Committed Amount and the Multi-currency Revolving-1 Committed Amount.

                  (b) Maturity Date. The Revolving-1 Commitments, the LOC
         Commitments and the Swingline Commitments shall automatically terminate
         on the Revolving-1 Commitment Termination Date.

         SECTION 2.8 PREPAYMENTS

                  (a) Optional Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to
         prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time; provided, however,
         that (i) each partial prepayment of Loans (other than Swingline Loans)
         shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and integral
         multiples of $1,000,000 (or the Alternative Currency Amount thereof, as
         applicable) in excess thereof and (ii) each prepayment of Swingline
         Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 and integral
         multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof. The Borrower shall give
         irrevocable written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in
         writing which confirmation may be by fax) of any such voluntary
         prepayment to the Administrative Agent (which shall notify the Lenders
         thereof as soon as practicable) not later than 1:30 P.M. (Charlotte,
         North Carolina time) on the Business Day prior to the date of the
         requested prepayment in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, on the
         third Business Day prior to the date of the requested prepayment in the
         case of LIBOR Rate Loans denominated in Dollars and on the fourth
         Business Day prior to the date of the requested prepayment in the case
         of Alternative Currency Loans. Each such notice of prepayment shall
         specify (A) the date of repayment, (B) the amount of repayment, (C)
         whether the repayment is of Dollar Revolving-1 Loans, Multi-currency
         Revolving-1 Loans (including the applicable Permitted Currency),
         Swingline Loans, Tranche A-1 Term Loans, Tranche B-1 Term Loans, or a
         combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount
         allocable to each and (D) whether the repayment is of LIBOR Rate Loans
         or Alternate Base Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, and, if of a
         combination thereof, the amount allocable to each. Prepayments of the
         Tranche A-1 Term Loan or the Tranche B-1 Term Loan under this Section
         2.8(a) shall be applied ratably to the remaining principal installments
         thereof (provided, however, promptly upon notification thereof, one or
         more holders of the Tranche B-1 Term Loan may decline to accept such
         prepayment to the extent there are sufficient amounts under the Tranche
         A-1 Term Loan outstanding to be paid with such prepayment, in which
         case, such declined prepayments shall be allocated pro rata among the
         Tranche A-1 Term Loan and the Tranche B-1 Term Loan held by Lenders
         accepting such payments). Subject to the foregoing terms, amounts
         prepaid under this Section 2.8(a) shall be applied first to Alternate
         Base Rate Loans and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct order of
         Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.8(a)
         shall be without premium or penalty except that (i) any prepayments of
         the Tranche B-1 Term Loan made during the period commencing on the
         Fourth Amendment Effective Date and ending on May 29, 2004 will require
         payment of a premium of 0.50% of the principal amount being prepaid on
         such date and (ii) all prepayments shall be subject to Section 2.18.
         Interest on the principal amount prepaid shall be payable on the date
         of such prepayment. Amounts






                                       51
<PAGE>

         prepaid on the Swingline Loans and the Revolving-1 Loans may be
         reborrowed in accordance with the terms hereof. Amounts prepaid on the
         Tranche A-1 Term Loan and the Tranche B-1 Term Loan may not be
         reborrowed.

                  (b) Mandatory Prepayments.

                           (i) Revolving-1 Committed Amount.

                                    (A) Dollar Revolving-1 Subcommitment. If at
                  any time after the Funding Date, the sum of the aggregate
                  principal amount of outstanding Dollar Revolving-1 Loans plus
                  Swingline Loans plus Dollar LOC Obligations shall exceed the
                  Dollar Revolving-1 Committed Amount, the Borrower immediately
                  shall prepay Dollar Revolving-1 Loans and (after all Dollar
                  Revolving-1 Loans have been repaid) cash collateralize the
                  Dollar LOC Obligations, in an amount sufficient to eliminate
                  such excess (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in
                  clause (vi) below).

                                    (B) Multi-currency Revolving-1
                  Subcommitment. If at any time after the Funding Date, for any
                  reason, the sum of the aggregate principal Dollar Amount of
                  outstanding Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans plus the Dollar
                  Amount of Multi-currency LOC Obligations shall exceed the
                  Multi-currency Revolving-1 Committed Amount, the Borrower
                  immediately shall prepay Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans and
                  (after all Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans have been repaid)
                  cash collateralize the Multi-currency LOC Obligations, in an
                  amount sufficient to eliminate such excess and in the
                  Permitted Currency in which each of the applicable
                  Multi-currency Letters of Credit are denominated (such
                  prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                           (ii) Asset Dispositions. Promptly following any Asset
                  Disposition in excess of $100,000,000 in any fiscal year, the
                  Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate amount equal
                  to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds derived from all such Asset
                  Dispositions (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in
                  clause (vi) below); provided, however, that such Net Cash
                  Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied to the extent
                  (1) the Borrower delivers to the Administrative Agent a
                  certificate stating that it intends to use such Net Cash
                  Proceeds to acquire fixed or capital assets in replacement of
                  the disposed assets, (2) such acquisition is committed to
                  within 180 days of receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds and (3)
                  such acquisition is consummated within 270 days of receipt of
                  such Net Cash Proceeds, it being expressly agreed that any Net
                  Cash Proceeds not so reinvested shall be applied to repay the
                  Loans immediately thereafter.

                           (iii) [Reserved].

                           (iv) Recovery Event. To the extent of cash proceeds
                  received in connection with a Recovery Event which are in
                  excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate and which are not
                  applied to repair, replace or relocate damaged property or to
                  purchase or acquire fixed or capital assets in replacement of
                  the assets lost or destroyed within 270 days (or 360 days, in
                  the case of improvements to real property) of the receipt of
                  such cash proceeds, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an
                  aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such
                  cash proceeds (such prepayment to be applied as set forth in
                  clause (vi) below).

                           (v) [Reserved].

                           (vi) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All
                  amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.8(b)
                  shall be applied as follows: (A) with respect to all amounts
                  prepaid pursuant to Section 2.8(b)(i)(A), to the Dollar
                  Revolving-1 Loans and then (after all Dollar Revolving-1 Loans
                  have been repaid) to a cash collateral account in respect of
                  Dollar LOC Obligations, (B) with respect to all amounts
                  prepaid pursuant to Section 2.8(b)(i)(B), to the
                  Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans and then (after all
                  Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans have been repaid) to a cash
                  collateral account in respect of Multi-currency LOC
                  Obligations, and (C) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                  pursuant to Sections 2.8(b)(ii) through (v), (1) first, pro
                  rata to the Tranche A-1 Term Loan and the Tranche B-1 Term
                  Loan (ratably to the remaining principal installments
                  thereof); provided, however, promptly upon notification
                  thereof, one or more holders of the Tranche B-1 Term Loan may
                  decline to accept a mandatory prepayment to the extent there
                  are sufficient amounts under the Tranche A-1 Term Loan
                  outstanding to be paid with such prepayment, in which case,
                  such declined payments shall be allocated pro rata among the
                  Tranche A-1 Term Loan and the Tranche B-1 Term Loan held by
                  Lenders accepting such prepayments, and (2) second, pro rata
                  to the Dollar Revolving-1 Loans and the Multi-currency
                  Revolving-1 Loans with corresponding permanent pro rata
                  reductions of the Dollar Revolving-1 Committed Amount and the
                  Multi-currency Revolving-1 Committed Amount and (after all
                  Revolving-1 Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral
                  account in respect of Dollar LOC Obligations and
                  Multi-currency LOC Obligations, pro rata. Within the
                  parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments
                  shall be applied first to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then
                  to LIBOR Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period
                  maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.8(b) shall be
                  subject to Section 2.18 and be accompanied by interest on the
                  principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment. Any
                  prepayments of the Tranche B-1 Term Loan made during the
                  period commencing on the Fourth Amendment Effective Date and
                  ending on May 29, 2004 pursuant to Section 2.8(b)(ii) will
                  require payment of a premium of 0.50% of the principal amount
                  being prepaid on such date.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
         the contrary, any prepayment of Alternative Currency Loans denominated
         in an Alternative Currency shall





                                       53

         time of the Administrative Agent's Correspondent) on the date specified
         for payment under this Agreement to the Administrative Agent's account
         with the Administrative Agent's Correspondent for the account of the
         Lenders.

         SECTION 2.9 MINIMUM BORROWING AMOUNTS AND PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS OF
TRANCHES.

         (a) Each Alternate Base Rate Loan (other than Swingline Loans)
borrowing shall be in a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and whole multiples of

         (b) Each LIBOR Rate Loan borrowing shall be in a minimum amount of
$10,000,000 and whole multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         (c) All borrowings, payments and prepayments in respect of Revolving-1
Loans shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that
after giving effect thereto the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving-1
Loans comprising any Tranche shall either be zero or shall not be less than
$10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         SECTION 2.10 INTEREST; INTEREST PAYMENT DATES.

         (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(b), all Loans (other than
Swingline Loans) shall bear interest as follows:

                  (i) Alternate Base Rate Loans. During such periods as Loans
         shall be comprised of Alternate Base Rate Loans, each such Alternate
         Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum
         of the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Percentage; and

                  (ii) LIBOR Rate Loans. During such periods as Loans shall be
         comprised of LIBOR Rate Loans, each such LIBOR Rate Loan shall bear
         interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of the applicable LIBOR
         Rate plus the Applicable Percentage.

         (b) Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the
Loans, and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents
shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the
applicable rate (including the Applicable Percentage) then in effect or, if no
rate is then in effect, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the Alternate Base
Rate plus the Applicable Percentage and the Letter of Credit Fees shall be
increased by 2% per annum.

         (c) Interest on Loans shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date, subject to Section 2.13; provided that (i) interest owing under
Section 2.10(b) shall be payable on demand, (ii) interest owing in connection
with any amounts repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) interest owing on LIBOR Loans which are
converted pursuant to Section 2.11, shall be payable on the date of such
conversion.

         SECTION 2.11 CONVERSION OPTIONS.

         (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Alternate Base
Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans by giving irrevocable written notice (or
telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing which confirmation may be by fax)
to the Administrative Agent not later than 1:30 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the requested conversion (a
"Notice of Conversion/Extension"). A form of Notice of Conversion/Extension is
attached as Schedule 2.11. If the date upon which an Alternate Base Rate Loan is
to be converted to a LIBOR Rate Loan is not a Business Day, then such conversion
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and during the period from
such last day of an Interest Period to such succeeding Business Day such Loan
shall bear interest as if it were an Alternate Base Rate Loan. All or any part
of outstanding Alternate Base Rate Loans may be converted as provided herein,
provided that (i) no Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Rate Loan when any
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) partial
conversions shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

         (b) Any LIBOR Rate Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration
of an Interest Period with respect thereto by compliance by the Borrower with
the notice provisions contained in Section 2.11(a); provided, that no LIBOR Rate
Loan may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, in which case such Loan shall be automatically converted to
an Alternate Base Rate Loan at the end of the applicable Interest Period with
respect thereto. If the Borrower shall fail to give timely notice of an election
to continue a LIBOR Rate Loan, or the continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans is not
permitted hereunder, such LIBOR Rate Loans shall be automatically converted to
Alternate Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period with
respect thereto.

         SECTION 2.12 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.

         (a) Interest payable hereunder with respect to Alternate Base Rate
Loans based on the Prime Rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365
days (or 366 days, as applicable) for the actual days elapsed. All other fees,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent
shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the Lenders of each
determination of a LIBOR Rate on the Business Day of the determination thereof.
Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the
Alternate Base Rate shall become effective as of the opening of business on the
day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate shall become effective. The
Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the effective date and the amount of each such change.

         (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing the computations used by the Administrative Agent
in determining any interest :rate.




                                       55
<PAGE>

         (c) It is the intent of the Lenders and the Credit Parties to conform
to and contract in strict compliance with applicable usury law from time to time
in effect. All agreements between the Lenders and the Credit Parties are hereby
limited by the provisions of this paragraph which shall override and control all
such agreements, whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written
or oral. In no way, nor in any event or contingency (including but not limited
to prepayment or acceleration of the maturity of any obligation), shall the
interest taken, reserved, contracted for, charged, or received under this Credit
Agreement, under the Notes or otherwise, exceed the maximum nonusurious amount
permissible under applicable law. If, from any possible construction of any of
the Credit Documents or any other document, interest would otherwise be payable
in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, any such construction shall be
subject to the provisions of this paragraph and such interest shall be
automatically reduced to the maximum nonusurious amount permitted under
applicable law, without the necessity of execution of any amendment or new
document. If any Lender shall ever receive anything of value which is
characterized as interest on the Loans under applicable law and which would,
apart from this provision, be in excess of the maximum nonusurious amount, an
amount equal to the amount which would have been excessive interest shall,
without penalty, be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing on
the Loans and not to the payment of interest, or refunded to the Borrower or the
other payor thereof if and to the extent such amount which would have been
excessive exceeds such unpaid principal amount of the Loans. The right to demand
payment of the Loans or any other Indebtedness evidenced by any of the Credit
Documents does not include the right to receive any interest which has not
otherwise accrued on the date of such demand, and the Lenders do not intend to
charge or receive any unearned interest in the event of such demand. All
interest paid or agreed to be paid to the Lenders with respect to the Loans
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term (including any renewal or
extension) of the Loans so that the amount of interest on account of such
indebtedness does not exceed the maximum nonusurious amount permitted by
applicable law.

         SECTION 2.13 PRO RATA TREATMENT AND PAYMENTS.

         (a) Each borrowing of Revolving-1 Loans and any reduction of the
Revolving-1 Commitments shall be made pro rata according to the respective
Commitment Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment under this Agreement or any
Note shall be applied, first, to any fees then due and owing by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.6, second, to interest then due and owing in respect of
the Notes of the Borrower and, third, to principal then due and owing hereunder
and under the Notes of the Borrower. Each payment on account of any fees
pursuant to Section 2.6 shall be made pro rata in accordance with the respective
amounts due and owing (except as to the portion of the Letter of Credit retained
by the Issuing Lender, the Issuing Lender Fees and fees payable to the Agents).
Each payment (other than prepayments) by the Borrower on account of principal of
and interest on the Revolving-1 Loans, the Tranche A-1 Term Loan and/or the
Tranche B-1 Term Loan shall be made pro rata according to the respective amounts
due and owing first to Alternate Base Rate Loans and then to LIBOR Rate Loans in
the direct order of Interest Period maturities. Each optional prepayment on
account of principal of the Loans shall be applied as set forth in Section
2.8(a); provided, that prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.16 shall be
applied in accordance with such section. Each mandatory prepayment on account of
principal of the Loans shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.8(b). All
payments





                                       56
<PAGE>

(including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of principal,
interest and fees shall be made without defense, set-off or counterclaim (except
as provided in Section 2.19(b)) and shall be made to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the Lenders at the Administrative Agent's office specified on
Schedule 9.2 in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00
P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. The Administrative
Agent shall distribute such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto promptly
upon receipt in like funds as received. If any payment hereunder (other than
payments on the LIBOR Rate Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business
Day, and, with respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be
payable at the then applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a
LIBOR Rate Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the
maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless
the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another
calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day.

         (b) Allocation of Payments After Event of Default. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all amounts collected or
received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender on account of the Credit
Party Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the Credit
Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as
follows:

                  FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of the Administrative Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of
         the Lenders under the Credit Documents and any protective advances made
         by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Collateral under or
         pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents;

                  SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Administrative
         Agent;

                  THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
         and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees)
         of each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under
         the Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
         Obligations owing to such Lender;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
         consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                  FIFTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of
         the Credit Party Obligations (including the payment or cash
         collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations) and any Hedging
         Obligations (including any termination payments and any accrued and
         unpaid interest thereon) (pro rata in accordance with all such amounts
         due);

                  SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other
         obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit
         Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST"
         through "FIFTH" above; and




                                       57
<PAGE>

                  SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whoever may
         be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

         In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in
         the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to
         the next succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an
         amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the
         then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to
         the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts
         available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH"
         and "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available
         for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to
         the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such
         amounts shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a cash collateral
         account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from
         time to time for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B)
         then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other
         obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above
         in the manner provided in this Section 2.13(b).

         SECTION 2.14 NON-RECEIPT OF FUNDS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by a Lender prior to the date a Loan is to be made by such Lender (which notice
shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make the
proceeds of such Loan available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such proceeds available to the
Administrative Agent on such date, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance
upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact
made available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall be
able to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such Lender does
not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's
demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and
the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover
from the Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, interest on such
corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date such corresponding
amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower to the
date such corresponding amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per
annum rate equal to (i) from the Borrower at the applicable rate for the
applicable borrowing pursuant to the Notice of Borrowing and (ii) from a Lender
at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

         (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing
by the Borrower, prior to the date on which any payment is due from it hereunder
(which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that the Borrower does not intend
to make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment when due, and the Administrative Agent may in reliance upon
such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to each Lender on
such payment date an amount equal to the portion of such assumed payment to
which such Lender is entitled hereunder, and if the Borrower has not in fact
made





                                       58
<PAGE>

such payment to the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, repay to
the Administrative Agent the amount made available to such Lender. If such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent on a date after the date such
amount was made available to such Lender, such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent on demand interest on such amount in respect of each day
from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such
Lender to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent at a per
annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

         (c) A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to the Borrower
or any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.14 shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

         SECTION 2.15 INABILITY TO DETERMINE INTEREST RATE.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if (i) the Administrative
Agent shall reasonably determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that, (A) by reason of circumstances affecting
the relevant market, reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining
LIBOR for an Interest Period or for an Alternative Currency, (B) a fundamental
change has occurred in the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to
any Alternative Currency (including, without limitation, changes in national or
international financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange
rates or exchange controls) or (C) it has become otherwise materially
impractical for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to make any Loan in an
Alternative Currency, or (ii) the Required Lenders shall reasonably determine
(which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that
the LIBOR Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders
of funding LIBOR Rate Loans that the Borrower has requested be outstanding as a
LIBOR Tranche during an Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall
forthwith give telephone notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to
the Borrower and the Lenders. Unless the Borrower shall have notified the
Administrative Agent upon receipt of such telephone notice that it wishes to
rescind or modify its request regarding such LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternative
Currency Loans, as applicable, any Loans that were requested to be made as LIBOR
Rate Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as applicable, shall be made as
Alternate Base Rate Loans in Dollars and any Loans that were requested to be
converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternative Currency Loans,
as applicable, shall be converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans in Dollars.
Until any such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further
Loans shall be made as, continued as, or converted into, LIBOR Rate Loans or
Alternative Currency Loans, as applicable, for the Interest Periods or
Alternative Currencies so affected.

         SECTION 2.16 ILLEGALITY.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the adoption of or any
change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof
by the relevant Governmental Authority to any Lender shall make it unlawful for
such Lender or its LIBOR Lending Office to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans or
Alternative Currency Loans, as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement or
to obtain in the interbank eurodollar market through its LIBOR Lending Office
the funds with which to make such Loans, (a) such Lender shall






                                       59
<PAGE>

promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower thereof, (b) the
commitment of such Lender hereunder to make LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternative
Currency Loans, as applicable, or continue LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternative
Currency Loans, as applicable, as such shall forthwith be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall give notice that the condition or situation which
gave rise to the suspension shall no longer exist, and (c) such Lender's Loans
then outstanding as LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as
applicable, if any, shall be converted on the last day of the Interest Period
for such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law as Alternate
Base Rate Loans in Dollars. The Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay any
Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such
Lender for actual and direct costs (but not including anticipated profits)
reasonably incurred by such Lender in making any repayment in accordance with
this Section including, but not limited to, any currency exchange loss and any
interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in
order to make or maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as
applicable, hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section submitted by such Lender, through the Administrative
Agent, to the Borrower shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to
change its LIBOR Lending Office) to avoid or to minimize any amounts which may
otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section; provided, however, that such
efforts shall not cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs or
legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender in its sole discretion to be
material.

         SECTION 2.17 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

                  (a) If the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law
         or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by any
         Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force
         of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority made
         subsequent to the date hereof:

                           (i) shall subject such Lender to any tax of any kind
         whatsoever with respect to any Letter of Credit or any application
         relating thereto, any LIBOR Rate Loan made by it, any Alternative
         Currency Loan made by it, or change the basis of taxation of payments
         to such Lender in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate of
         tax on the overall net income of such Lender);

                           (ii) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any
         reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement
         against assets held by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the
         account of, advances, loans or other extensions of credit by, or any
         other acquisition of funds by, any office of such Lender which is not
         otherwise included in the determination of the LIBOR Rate hereunder; or

                           (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other
         condition;

         and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
         Lender of making or maintaining LIBOR Rate Loans, Alternative Currency
         Loans, or the Letters of Credit or to reduce any amount receivable
         hereunder or under any Note and such Lender's costs have increased with
         respect to other customers under similar circumstances, then, in any
         such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay






                                       60
<PAGE>

         such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to
         compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount
         receivable which such Lender reasonably deems to be material as
         determined by such Lender with respect to its LIBOR Rate Loans,
         Alternative Currency Loans, or Letters of Credit. A certificate as to
         any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section submitted by
         such Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be
         conclusive in the absence of manifest error. Each Lender agrees to use
         reasonable efforts (including reasonable efforts to change its Domestic
         Lending Office or LIBOR Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or
         to minimize any amounts which might otherwise be payable pursuant to
         this paragraph of this Section; provided, however, that such efforts
         shall riot cause the imposition on such Lender of any additional costs
         or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by such Lender to be material.

         (b) If any Lender shall have reasonably determined that the adoption of
or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy or in the
interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or any
corporation controlling such Lender with any request or directive regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank
or Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof does or shall have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or such corporation's
capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Lender or such corporation could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's or such
corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount reasonably
deemed by such Lender to be material, and such Lender has experienced such
effect with respect to other customers under similar circumstances, then from
time to time, within fifteen (15) days after demand by such Lender, the Borrower
shall pay to such Lender such additional amount as shall be certified by such
Lender as being required to compensate it for such reduction. Such a certificate
as to any additional amounts payable under this Section submitted by a Lender
(which certificate shall include a description of the basis for the
computation), through the Administrative Agent, to the Borrower shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

         (c) The agreements in this Section 2.17 shall survive the termination
of this Agreement and payment of the Notes and all other amounts payable
hereunder.

         SECTION 2.18 INDEMNITY.

         The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold such
Lender harmless from any funding loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in payment of the
principal amount of or interest on any Loan by such Lender in accordance with
the terms hereof, (b) default by the Borrower in accepting a borrowing after the
Borrower has given a notice in accordance with the terms hereof, (c) default by
the Borrower in making any prepayment after the Borrower has given a notice in
accordance with the terms hereof, and/or (d) the making by the Borrower of a
prepayment of a Loan, or the conversion thereof, on a day which is not the last
day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, or in a currency other than as
required hereunder, in each case including, but not limited to, any foreign
exchange cost and any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable
by such





                                       61
<PAGE>

Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain its Loans
hereunder. A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this
Section submitted by any Lender, through the Administrative Agent, to the
Borrower (which certificate must be delivered to the Administrative Agent within
thirty days following such default, prepayment or conversion) shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The agreements in this Section
shall survive termination of this Agreement and payment of the Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 2.19 TAXES.

                  (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder or under any
         Note will be, except as provided in Section 2.19(b), made free and
         clear of, and without: deduction or withholding for, any present or
         future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other
         charges of whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any Governmental
         Authority or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof
         or therein with respect to such payments (but excluding any tax imposed
         on or measured by the net income or profits of a Lender) and all
         interest, penalties or similar liabilities with respect thereto (all
         such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or
         other charges being referred to collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes
         are so levied or imposed, the Borrower agrees to pay the full amount of
         such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may be necessary so that
         every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or under any
         Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes,
         will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note.
         The Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent as soon as
         practicable after the date the payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to
         applicable law certified copies (to the extent reasonably available and
         required by law) of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the
         Borrower. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
         Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for the
         amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender but
         excluding any interest or penalties caused by such Lender's failure to
         pay any such taxes when due.

                  (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such
         term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) agrees to deliver
         to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Closing
         Date, or in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee of
         an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.6(d) (unless the
         respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to
         such assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or
         transfer to such Lender, (i) if the Lender is a "bank" within the
         meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, two accurate and complete
         original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or
         W-8ECI (or successor forms) certifying such Lender's entitlement to a
         complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to
         payments to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if
         the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A)
         of the Code, either Internal Revenue Service Form W8BEN or W-8ECI as
         set forth in clause (i) above, or (x) a certificate substantially in
         the form of Schedule 2.19 (any such certificate, a "2.19 Certificate")
         and (y) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal
         Revenue Service Form W-8 (or successor





                                       62
<PAGE>

         form) certifying such Lender's entitlement to an exemption from United
         States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made
         under this Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender
         agrees that it will deliver upon the Borrower's request updated
         versions of the foregoing, as applicable, whenever the previous
         certification has become obsolete or inaccurate in any material
         respect, together with such other forms as may be required in order to
         confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a continued
         exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with
         respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained in Section 2.19(a), but subject to
         the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) each Borrower shall be
         entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or
         withhold Taxes imposed by the United States (or any political
         subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest, fees
         or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which
         is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section
         7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the
         extent that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower U.S. Internal
         Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such
         deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated
         pursuant to Section 2.19(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a
         Lender in respect of Taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such
         Lender has not provided to the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service
         Forms required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to this Section
         2.19(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a
         Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do
         not establish a complete exemption from withholding of such Taxes.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding
         sentence or elsewhere in this Section 2.19, the Borrower agrees to pay
         additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner set forth
         in Section 2.19(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction
         requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts
         deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding
         sentence as a result of any changes after the Closing Date in any
         applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or
         order, or in the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or
         withholding of Taxes.

                  (c) Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (including
         reasonable efforts to change its Domestic Lending Office or LIBOR
         Lending Office, as the case may be) to avoid or to minimize any amounts
         which might otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section; provided,
         however, that such efforts shall not cause the imposition on such
         Lender of any additional costs or legal or regulatory burdens deemed by
         such Lender in its sole discretion to be material.

                  (d) If the Borrower pays any additional amount pursuant to
         this Section 2.19 with respect to a Lender, such Lender shall use
         reasonable efforts to obtain a refund of tax or credit against its tax
         liabilities on account of such payment; provided that such Lender shall
         have no obligation to use such reasonable efforts if either (i) it is
         in an excess foreign tax credit position or (ii) it believes in good
         faith, in its sole discretion, that claiming a refund or credit would
         cause adverse tax consequences to it. In the event that such Lender
         receives such a refund or credit, such Lender shall pay to the Borrower
         an amount that such Lender reasonably determines is equal to the net
         tax benefit obtained by





                                       63
<PAGE>

         such Lender as a result of such payment by the Borrower. In the event
         that no refund or credit is obtained with respect to the Borrower's
         payments to such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19(d), then such
         Lender shall upon request provide a certification that such Lender has
         not received a refund or credit for such payments. Nothing contained in
         this Section 2.19(d) shall require a Lender to disclose or detail the
         basis of its calculation of the amount of any tax benefit or any other
         amount or the basis of its determination referred to in the proviso to
         the first sentence of this Section 2.19(d) to the Borrower or any other
         party.

                  (e) The agreements in this Section 2.19 shall survive the
         termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all
         other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 2.20 INDEMNIFICATION; NATURE OF ISSUING LENDER'S DUTIES.

                  (a) In addition to its other obligations under Section 2.3,
         the Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save the
         Issuing Lender harmless from and against any and all claims, demands,
         liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including
         reasonable attorneys' fees) that the Issuing Lender may incur or be
         subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (i) the issuance of
         any Letter of Credit or (ii) the failure of the Issuing Lender to honor
         a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a. result of any act or omission,
         whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de
         facto government or governmental authority (all such acts or omissions,
         herein called "Government Acts").

                  (b) As between the Borrower and the Issuing Lender, the
         Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any
         Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof. The Issuing Lender shall
         not be responsible: (i) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
         genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in
         connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of
         Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
         invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (ii) for the
         validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
         purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or
         benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may
         prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) for failure of
         the beneficiary of a Letter of Credit to comply fully with conditions
         required in order to draw upon a Letter of Credit; (iv) for errors,
         omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
         messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not
         they be in cipher; (v) for errors in interpretation of technical terms;
         (vi) for any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any
         document required in order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit
         or of the proceeds thereof; and (vii) for any consequences arising from
         causes beyond the control of the Issuing Lender, including, without
         limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall affect,
         impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender's rights or powers
         hereunder.

                  (c) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
         specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted
         by the Issuing Lender,





                                       64
<PAGE>

         under or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related
         certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put such
         Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower. It is the
         intention of the parties that this Agreement shall be construed and
         applied to protect and indemnify the Issuing Lender against any and all
         risks involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of which
         risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower, including, without
         limitation, any and all risks of the acts or omissions, whether
         rightful or wrongful, of any Governmental Authority. The Issuing Lender
         shall not, in any way, be liable for any failure by the Issuing Lender
         or anyone else to pay any drawing under any Letter of Credit as a
         result of any Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of
         the Issuing Lender.

                  (d) Nothing in this Section 2.20 is intended to limit the
         reimbursement obligation of the Borrower contained in Section 2.3(d)
         hereof. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.20 shall
         survive the termination of this Agreement. No act or omissions of any
         current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any way
         affect or impair the rights of the Issuing Lender to enforce any right,
         power or benefit under this Agreement.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
         Section 2.20, the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify any
         Issuing Lender in respect of any liability incurred by such Issuing
         Lender arising out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
         Issuing Lender (including action not taken by an Issuing Lender), as
         determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

         SECTION 2.21 DEFAULTING LENDERS; LIMITATION ON CLAIMS.

                  (a) Generally. In addition to the rights and remedies that may
         be available to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower under this
         Agreement or applicable law, if at any time a Lender is a Defaulting
         Lender such Defaulting Lender's right to participate in the
         administration of the Loans, this Agreement and the other Credit
         Documents (excluding for purposes hereof, those matters requiring the
         unanimous consent or approval of the Lenders, or requiring the approval
         of each Lender directly affected thereby, pursuant to Section 9.1(i)
         through 9.1(vii) hereof or Section 9.6(a)), including without
         limitation, any right to vote in respect of, to consent to or to direct
         any action or inaction of the Administrative Agent or to be taken into
         account in the calculation of the Required Lenders, shall be suspended
         during the pendency of such failure or refusal. If a Lender is a
         Defaulting Lender because it has failed to make timely payment to the
         Administrative Agent of any amount required to be paid to the
         Administrative Agent hereunder (without giving effect to any notice or
         cure periods), in addition to other rights and remedies which the
         Administrative Agent or the Borrower may have under the immediately
         preceding provisions or otherwise, the Administrative Agent shall be
         entitled (i) to collect interest from such Defaulting Lender on such
         delinquent payment for the period from the date on which the payment
         was due until the date on which the payment is made at the Federal
         Funds Effective Rate, (ii) to withhold or setoff and to apply in
         satisfaction of the defaulted payment and any related interest, any
         amounts otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender under this
         Agreement or any other Credit





                                       65
<PAGE>

         Document until such defaulted payment and related interest has been
         paid in full and such default no longer exists and (iii) to bring an
         action or suit against such Defaulting Lender in a court of competent
         jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and any related interest.
         Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent in respect of a
         Defaulting Lender's Loans shall not be paid to such Defaulting Lender
         and shall be held uninvested by the Administrative Agent and either
         applied against the purchase price of such Loans under the following
         subsection (b) or paid to such Defaulting Lender upon the default of
         such Defaulting Lender being cured.

                  (b) Purchase of Defaulting Lender's Commitment. Any Lender who
         is not a Defaulting Lender shall have the right, but not the
         obligation, in its sole discretion, to acquire all of a Defaulting
         Lender's Commitment. If more than one Lender exercises such right, each
         such Lender shall have the right to acquire such proportion of such
         Defaulting Lender's Commitment on a pro rata basis. Upon any such
         purchase, the Defaulting Lender's interest in the Loans and its rights
         hereunder (but not its liability in respect thereof or under the Credit
         Documents or this Agreement to the extent the same relate to the period
         prior to the effective date of the purchase) shall terminate on the
         date of purchase, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all
         documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest
         to the purchaser thereof subject to and in accordance with the
         requirements set forth in Section 9.6, including an appropriate
         Commitment Transfer Supplement. The purchase price for the Commitment
         of a Defaulting Lender shall be equal to the sum of the amount of the
         principal balance of the Loans outstanding and owed by the Borrower to
         the Defaulting Lender, plus any accrued interest with respect thereto,
         plus any fees or other amounts owed by the Borrower to the Defaulting
         Lender. Prior to payment of such purchase price to a Defaulting Lender,
         the Administrative Agent shall apply against such purchase price any
         amounts retained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to the last
         sentence of the immediately preceding subsection (a). The Defaulting
         Lender shall be entitled to receive amounts owed to it by the Borrower
         on account of principal of and interest on the Loans and the Notes, and
         fees and other amounts due under the Credit Documents which accrued
         prior to the date of the default by the Defaulting Lender, to the
         extent the same are received by the Administrative Agent from or on
         behalf of the Borrower. There shall be no recourse against any Lender
         or the Administrative Agent for the payment of such sums by the
         Borrower except to the extent of the receipt of payments from any other
         party or in respect of the Loans.

         SECTION 2.22 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

         If any Lender shall become affected by any of the changes or events
described in Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 2.19 (any such Lender being
hereinafter referred to as a "Replaced Lender") and shall petition the Borrower
for any increased cost or amounts thereunder, then in such case, the Borrower
may, upon at least five (5) Business Days' notice to the Administrative Agent
and such Replaced Lender, designate a replacement lender (a "Replacement
Lender") acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion, to
which such Replaced Lender shall, subject to its receipt (unless a later date
for the remittance thereof shall be agreed upon by the Borrower and the Replaced
Lender) of all amounts owed to such Replaced Lender





                                       66
<PAGE>

under Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or 2.19 assign all (but not less than all) of
its rights, obligations, Loans and Commitments hereunder; provided, that all
amounts owed to such Replaced Lender by the Borrower (except liabilities which
by the terms hereof survive the payment in full of the Loans and termination of
this Agreement) shall be paid in full as of the date of such assignment. Upon
any assignment by any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.22 becoming effective,
the Replacement Lender shall thereupon be deemed to be a "Lender" for all
purposes of this Agreement and such Replaced Lender shall thereupon cease to be
a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and shall have no further rights
or obligations hereunder (other than pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 or
2.19 and 9.5 while such Replaced Lender was a Lender;).

         Notwithstanding any Replaced Lender's failure or refusal to assign its
rights, obligations, Loans and Commitments under this Section 2.22, the Replaced
Lender shall cease to be a "Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement and the
Replacement Lender substituted therefor upon payment to the Replaced Lender by
the Replacement Lender of all amounts set forth in this Section 2.22 without any
further action of the Replaced Lender.

         SECTION 2.23 ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY MATTERS.

                  (a) Effectiveness of euro Provisions. With respect to any
         state (or the currency of such state) that is not a Participating
         Member State on the date of this Agreement, the provisions of this
         Section 2.23 shall become effective in relation to such state (and the
         currency of such state) at and from the date on which such state
         becomes a Participating Member State.

                  (b) Basis of Accrual. Subject to clause (a) above, with
         respect to the currency of any state that becomes a Participating
         Member State, the accrual of interest or fees expressed in this
         Agreement with respect to such currency shall be based upon the
         applicable convention or practice in the London Interbank Market for
         the basis of accrual of interest or fees in respect of the euro, which
         such convention or practice shall replace such expressed basis
         effective as of and from the date on which such state becomes a
         Participating Member State; provided that if any Loan in the currency
         of such state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such
         replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of
         the then current Interest Period.

                  (c) Redenomination of Alternative Currency Loans.

                           (i) Conversion to the Alternate Base Rate. If any
                  Alternative Currency Loan is required to bear interest based
                  on the Alternate Base Rate rather than the LIBOR Rate pursuant
                  to Section 2.15, Section 2.16 or any other applicable
                  provision hereof, such Loan shall be funded in Dollars in an
                  amount equal to the Dollar Amount of such Loan, all subject to
                  the provisions of Section 2.8(b). The Borrower shall reimburse
                  the Lenders upon any such conversion for any amounts required
                  to be paid under Section 2.18.




                                       67
<PAGE>

                           (ii) Redenomination of Loans. Subject to clause (a)
                  above, any Loan to be denominated in the currency of the
                  applicable Participating Member State shall be made in the
                  euro.

                           (iii) Redenomination of Obligations. Subject to
                  clause (a) above hereof, any obligation of any party under
                  this Agreement or any other Credit Document which has been
                  denominated in the currency of a Participating Member State
                  shall be redenominated into the euro.

                           (iv) Further Assurances. The terms and provisions of
                  this Agreement will be subject to such reasonable changes of
                  construction as determined by the Administrative Agent to
                  reflect the implementation of the EMU in any Participating
                  Member State or any market conventions relating to the fixing
                  and/or calculation of interest being changed or replaced and
                  to reflect market practice at that time, and subject thereto,
                  to put the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower
                  in the same position, so far as possible, that they would have
                  been if such implementation had not occurred. In connection
                  therewith, the Borrower agrees, at the request of the
                  Administrative Agent, at the time of or at any time following
                  the implementation of the EMU in any Participating Member
                  State or any market conventions relating to the fixing and/or
                  calculation of interest being changed or replaced, to enter
                  into an agreement amending this Agreement in such manner as
                  the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

                  (d) Regulatory Limitation. In the event, as a result of
         increases in the value of Alternative Currencies against the Dollar or
         for any other reason, the obligation of any of the Lenders to make
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans (taking into account the Dollar Amount
         of the Credit Party Obligations and all other indebtedness required to
         be aggregated under 12 U.S.C.A. Section 84, as amended, the regulations
         promulgated thereunder and any other Requirement of Law) is determined
         by such Lender to exceed its then applicable legal lending limit under
         12 U.S.C.A. Section 84, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
         thereunder, or any other Requirement of Law, the amount of additional
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans such Lender shall be obligated to make
         or issue or participate in hereunder shall immediately be reduced to
         the maximum amount which such Lender may legally advance (as determined
         by such Lender), the obligation of each of the remaining Lenders
         hereunder shall be proportionately reduced, based on their applicable
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Commitment Percentages and, to the extent
         necessary under such laws and regulations (as determined by each of the
         Lenders, with respect to the applicability of such laws and regulations
         to itself), and the Borrower shall reduce, or cause to be reduced,

         other currency exchange loss incurred by the Administrative Agent or

         Alternative Currency shall be determined in accordance with the terms
         of this Agreement by the Administrative Agent (in respect of the most
         recent Revaluation Date). Such Dollar Amount shall become effective as

         time specify to be necessary or appropriate to reflect the introduction
         of or change over to the euro in Participating Member States.

                  under Section 4201 or 4204 of ERISA (including the obligation
                  to satisfy secondary liability as a result of a purchaser

<PAGE>


                  enforce Section 515 of ERISA, which proceeding is not

                  pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code or Section 307 of
                  ERISA, would result in the loss of tax-exempt status of the
                  trust of which such Plan is a part if any Credit Party or any
                  of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate fails to timely
                  provide security to the Plan in accordance with the provisions

         aggregate) have a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (f) any other development or event which could reasonably be
         expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Each notice pursuant to this Section shall be accompanied by a statement of a
Responsible Officer setting forth- details of the occurrence referred to therein
and stating what action the Borrower proposes to take with respect thereto. In
the case of any notice of a Default or Event of Default, the Borrower shall
specify that such notice is a Default or Event of Default notice on the face
thereof.

         any, with, all applicable Environmental Laws and obtain and comply in

         and subtenants obtain and comply in all material respects with and
         maintain, any and all licenses, approvals, notifications, registrations
         or permits required by applicable Environmental Laws except to the

         Material Adverse Effect;

                  (b) Conduct and complete all investigations, studies, sampling
         and testing, and all remedial, removal and other actions required under

         regarding Environmental Laws except to the extent that the same are
         being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and the
         pendency of such proceedings could not reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect; and




                                       92

                  (c) Defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative
         Agent and the Lenders, and their respective employees, agents, officers
         and directors, from and against any and all claims, demands, penalties,
         fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses of
         whatever kind or nature known or unknown, contingent or otherwise,

         noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable
         to the operations of the Borrower any of its Subsidiaries or the Real
         Properties, or any orders, requirements or demands of Governmental
         Authorities related thereto, including, without limitation, reasonable
         attorney's and consultant's fees, investigation and laboratory fees,
         response costs, court costs and litigation expenses, except to the
         extent that any of the foregoing arise out of the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of the party seeking indemnification therefor. The
         agreements in this paragraph shall survive repayment of the Notes and
         all other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 5.9  FINANCIAL COVENANTS.

                  The Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Restricted

         including March 31, 2005
         April 1, 2005 and thereafter                     3.75 to 1.00
</Table>

                  (b) Interest Coverage Ratio. The Interest Coverage Ratio, as
         of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower and its
         Restricted Subsidiaries, shall be greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.0.

                  (c) Minimum Consolidated Net Worth. The Consolidated Net Worth

         the Consolidated Net Income (with no deduction for net losses) for the
         fiscal quarter then ended plus 50% of the amount by which the "total
         stockholders equity" of the Borrower is increased as a result of any
         public or private offering of ownership interests of the Borrower after
         the Fourth Amendment Effective Date (other than increases to the extent
         such increases result from Equity Issuances to, or capital
         contributions from, any Affiliate of the Borrower or Equity Issuances
         pursuant to an employee or director stock option or incentive plan or
         other employee benefit plan or from Equity Issuances in connection with
         the acquisition of assets or Capital Stock). Promptly upon consummation
         of each such public or private offering, the Borrower shall





                                       93

         time to time as shall be necessary to ensure that each of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries remains a Subsidiary at all times.

                  (b) The Credit Parties will cause each of their wholly-owned
         Domestic Subsidiaries that are Material Subsidiaries and Restricted
         Subsidiaries (other than Suiza Capital Trust II), whether newly formed,
         after acquired or otherwise existing, to promptly become a Guarantor
         hereunder by way of execution of a Joinder Agreement and take such
         other action as may be required pursuant to the terms of Section 5.13.
         The guaranty obligations of each Additional Credit Party shall be
         secured by all real and personal property assets of such Additional
         Credit Party pursuant to the requirements of Section 5.13; provided,
         that obligations of the Acquired Company and its Subsidiaries shall not
         be secured by any real property owned by the Acquired Company or any of
         its Subsidiaries nor by any equity ownership interests of any of the
         Acquired Company's Subsidiaries that own any real property.

         SECTION 5.11 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders, and all applicable
restrictions imposed by all Governmental Authorities, applicable to it and its
assets if noncompliance with any such law, rule, regulation, order or
restriction could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 5.12  PLEDGED ASSETS.

                  (a) Each Credit Party will cause (i) (A) 100% of the Capital
         Stock (or, if less, the full amount owned by such Credit Party) of each
         of the direct or indirect Domestic Subsidiaries which are Material
         Subsidiaries of such Person and which are Restricted Subsidiaries, but
         which are not Subsidiaries of the Acquired Company, and (B) 65% of the
         Capital Stock (or, if less, the full amount owned by such Credit Party)
         of each of the First Tier Foreign Subsidiaries which are Material
         Subsidiaries of such Person (but which are not Subsidiaries of the
         Acquired Company), unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent,
         and (ii) all of such Credit Party's real and personal property
         Collateral to be subject at all times to a first priority, perfected
         Lien in, favor of the Administrative Agent pursuant to the terms and
         conditions of the Security Documents or such other security documents
         as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request subject only to
         Permitted Liens; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
         no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be required to pledge the Capital
         Stock of its Subsidiaries and the Borrower shall not be required to
         pledge the Capital Stock of Suiza Capital Trust II, and the Acquired
         Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to





                                       94

         of any of the Acquired Company's Subsidiaries that own any real
         property.

                  (b) Within 30 days after a Credit Party changes the location
         of its chief executive office, the Borrower shall notify the
         Administrative Agent of such change and shall execute and deliver, or
         cause to be executed and delivered, to the Administrative Agent such
         UCC financing statements and other documentation as the Administrative
         Agent may reasonably request.

         SECTION 5.13  ADDITIONAL CREDIT PARTIES.

         As soon as practicable and in any event within 30 days after any Person
(whether newly formed, acquired or otherwise) becomes a Material Subsidiary that
is a Restricted Subsidiary of any Credit Party the Borrower shall provide the
Administrative Agent with written notice thereof setting forth information in
reasonable detail describing all of the assets of such Person and shall (a) if
such Person is a wholly-owned Domestic Subsidiary of a Credit Party, cause such
Person to execute a Joinder Agreement in substantially the same form as Schedule
5.13 (subject to exceptions regarding real property and ownership interests as
collateral as set forth. herein in the case of a Subsidiary of the Acquired
Company), (b) cause 100% (if such Person is a Domestic Subsidiary of a Credit
Party other than a Subsidiary of the Acquired Company) or, unless otherwise
agreed by the Administrative Agent, 65% (if such Person is a First Tier Foreign
Subsidiary of a Credit Party that is also a Material Subsidiary) of the Capital
Stock of such Person owned by a Credit Party to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent (together with undated stock powers signed in blank
(unless, with respect to a First Tier Foreign Subsidiary, such stock powers are
deemed unnecessary by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion
under the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Person)) and pledged
to the Administrative Agent pursuant to an appropriate pledge agreement(s) in
substantially the form of the Pledge Agreement or joinder to the Pledge
Agreement and otherwise in form acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (c) if
such Person is a Restricted Subsidiary, cause such Person to grant a security
interest in its material real property (excluding real property owned by a
Subsidiary of the Acquired Company) and the personal property Collateral of such
Person pursuant to appropriate mortgages and/or security agreements in
substantially the form of the Security Agreement or a joinder to the Security
Agreement, subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens [NOTE: PURSUANT
TO THE TERMS OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, ONLY RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES WHICH ARE
DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO JOIN THE SECURITY AGREEMENT AND PLEDGE
A SECURITY INTEREST IN THEIR ASSETS], and (d) deliver such other documentation
as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing, including, without limitation, appropriate UCC-1 financing
statements, certified resolutions and other organizational and authorizing
documents of such Person and favorable opinions of counsel to such Person (which
shall cover, among other things, the legality, validity, binding effect and
enforceability of the documentation referred to above and the perfection of the
Administrative Agent's liens thereunder).

each of their Subsidiaries that are restructured or reorganized on or about the
Funding Date to be duly qualified to conduct business and in good standing under
the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of
property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification except to
the extent that the failure to so qualify or be in good standing could not, in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                               NEGATIVE COVENANTS

         in the entry of an order for any such relief which shall not have been
         vacated, discharged, or stayed or bonded pending appeal within 60 days
         from the entry thereof; or (iv) the Borrower or any Restricted
         Subsidiary shall take any action in furtherance of, or indicating its
         consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the acts set forth
         in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) above; or (v) the Borrower or any

         shall not have been paid and satisfied, vacated, discharged, stayed or
         bonded pending appeal within 30 days from the entry thereof, or

                  (g) (i) Any Person shall engage in any "prohibited
         transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
         Code) involving any Plan, (ii) any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
         defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, shall exist
         with respect to any Plan or any Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan
         (other than a Permitted Lien) shall arise on the assets of the
         Borrower, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Commonly Controlled
         Entity, (iii) a Reportable Event shall occur with respect to, or
         proceedings shall commence to have a trustee appointed, or a trustee
         shall be appointed, to administer or to terminate, any Single Employer
         Plan, which Reportable Event or commencement of proceedings or
         appointment of a Trustee is, in the reasonable opinion of the Required
         Lenders, likely to result in the termination of such Plan for purposes
         of Title IV of ERISA, (iv) any Single Employer Plan shall terminate for
         purposes of Title IV of ERISA, (v) the Borrower, any of its Restricted
         Subsidiaries or any Commonly Controlled Entity shall, or in the

         Reorganization of, any Multiemployer Plan or (vi) any other similar
         event or condition shall occur or exist with respect to a Plan; and in
         each case in clauses (i) through (vi) above, such event or condition,
         together with all other such events or conditions, if any, could have a
         Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (h) A reasonable basis shall exist for the assertion against
         the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any predecessor in interest
         of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, of (or there shall have
         been asserted against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries) an
         Environmental Claim that, in the judgment of the Required Lenders, is
         reasonably likely to be determined adversely to the Borrower or any of
         its Subsidiaries, and the amount thereof (either individually or in the
         aggregate) is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
         (insofar as such amount is payable by the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries but after deducting any portion thereof that is reasonably
         expected to be paid by other creditworthy Persons jointly and severally
         liable therefor); or

                  (i) A Change of Control shall occur; or

                  (j) The Guaranty or any provision thereof shall cease to be in
         full force and effect or any Guarantor or any Person acting by or on
         behalf of any Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm any Guarantor's
         obligations under the Guaranty; or

                  (k) Any other Credit Document shall fail to be in full force
         and effect or to give the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders the
         security interests, liens, rights, powers and privileges purported to
         be created thereby (except as such documents may be terminated or no
         longer in force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof, other
         than those indemnities and provisions which by their terms shall
         survive).

         SECTION 7.2 ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, then, and in any such
event, (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(e)
above, automatically the Commitments shall immediately terminate and the Loans
(with accrued interest thereon), and all other amounts under the Credit
Documents (including without limitation the maximum amount of all contingent
liabilities under Letters of Credit) shall immediately become due and payable,
the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enforce any and all other
rights and interests created and existing under the Credit Documents, including,
without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Security
Documents, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights of
set-off, and the Administrative Agent shall have the right to enforce any and
all other rights and remedies of a creditor under applicable law, and (b) if
such event is any other Event of Default, with the written consent of the
Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may, or upon the written request of
the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the Borrower
(a copy of which shall be sent to the Lenders), take any or all of the following
actions: (i) declare the Commitments to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the
Commitments shall immediately terminate; (ii) declare the Loans (with accrued
interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the Notes
to be due and payable forthwith and direct the Borrower to pay to the
Administrative Agent cash collateral as security for the LOC Obligations for
subsequent drawings under then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal
to the maximum amount of which may be drawn under Letters of Credit then
outstanding, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable; (iii)
enforce any and all other rights and interests created and existing under the
Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all rights and remedies
existing under the Security Documents, all rights and remedies against a
Guarantor and all rights of set-off; and (iv) enforce any and all rights and
remedies of a creditor under applicable law. Except as expressly provided above
in this Section 7.2, presentment, demand, protest and all other notices of any
kind are hereby expressly waived.

         SECTION 7.3 JUDGMENT CURRENCY.

The obligation of the Borrower to pay the Credit Party Obligations and the
obligation of any such Person to make payments of any other amounts payable
hereunder or pursuant to any other





                                      106
<PAGE>
Credit Document in the currency specified for such payment shall not be
discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment,
which is expressed in or converted into any other currency, except to the extent
that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt by each of the
Administrative Agent and Lenders of the full amount of the particular Permitted
Currency expressed to be payable pursuant to the applicable Credit Document. The
Administrative Agent shall, using all amounts obtained or received from the
Borrower pursuant to any such tender or recovery in payment of principal of and
interest on the Credit Party Obligations, promptly purchase the applicable
currency at the most favorable spot exchange rate determined by the
Administrative Agent to be available to it. The obligation of the Borrower to
make payments in the applicable currency shall be enforceable as an alternative
or additional cause of action solely for the purpose of recovering in the
applicable currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall
short of the full amount of the currency expressed to be payable pursuant to the
applicable Credit Document.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                    THE AGENT

         SECTION 8.1 APPOINTMENT.

         Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and appoints First Union
National Bank as the Administrative Agent of such Lender under this Agreement,
and each such Lender irrevocably authorizes First Union National Bank, as the
Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and to exercise such powers and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of
this Agreement, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 8.2 DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may appoint one of its
Affiliates as its agent to perform the functions of the Administrative Agent
hereunder relating to the advancing of funds to the Borrower and distribution of
funds to the Lenders and to perform such other related functions of the
Administrative Agent hereunder as are reasonably incidental to such functions.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 8.3 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS.

         Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any
action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in
connection with this Agreement (except for its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any Credit Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of any of the Credit Documents or for any failure of any Credit
Party to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Administrative
Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire
as to the observance or performance by the Credit Parties of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Credit Parties.

         SECTION 8.4 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including, without limitation, counsel to the Credit Parties), independent
accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all purposes unless (a) a written notice of assignment, negotiation
or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent and (b)
the Administrative Agent shall have received the written agreement of such
assignee to be bound hereby as fully and to the same extent as if such assignee
were an original Lender party hereto, in each case in form satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in
failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
any of the Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders
or all of the Lenders, as may be required under this Agreement, and such request
and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon
all the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes.

         SECTION 8.5 NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless the
Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default"'. In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such
action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably
directed by the Required





                                      108
<PAGE>

Lenders; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall
have received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect
to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best
interests of the Lenders except to the extent that this Credit Agreement
expressly requires that such action be taken, or not taken, only with the
consent or upon the authorization of the Required Lenders, or all of the
Lenders, as the case may be.

         SECTION 8.6 NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS.

         Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Administrative
Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact
or affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs
of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and made its own decision to make
its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent
or any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit analysis,
appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may come
into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

         SECTION 8.7 INDEMNIFICATION.

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Administrative Agent in its capacity
hereunder (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their respective
Commitment Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
under this Section, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time (including, without
limitation, at any time following the payment of the Notes) be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to
or arising out of any Credit Document' or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
to the extent resulting from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or
willful





                                      109
<PAGE>

misconduct, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The agreements
in this Section 8.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment
of the Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 8.8 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower as
though the Administrative Agent were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
With respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity.

         SECTION 8.9 SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

         The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30
days' prior notice to the Borrower and the Lenders. If the Administrative Agent
shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the Notes, then
the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for
the Lenders, which successor agent shall be approved by the Borrower, so long as
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Notes. If no successor Administrative Agent has accepted
appointment as Administrative Agent within sixty (60) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent's giving notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation shall nevertheless become effective and the Lenders shall
perform all duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if
any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided for above. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 8.9 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

         SECTION 8.10 RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER AGENTS.

         The Syndication Agent, the co-documentation agents and any other agents
designated as such on the signature pages hereto (other than the Administrative
Agent) shall have no responsibilities under this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents other than as a Lender.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 9.1 AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND RELEASE OF COLLATERAL.

Credit Documents, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented,

Documents or in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.1. The Required

Administrative Agent may, from time to time, (a) enter into with the Borrower
written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto and to the other Credit
Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this Agreement or the
other Credit Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or of
the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such terms and conditions

                  maturity of any Loan or Note or any installment thereon, or
                  the reimbursement obligations with respect to any Letters of
                  Credit, or extend the expiry of any Letter of Credit beyond
                  the Maturity Date, or reduce the stated rate of any interest
                  or fee payable hereunder (other than interest at the increased
                  post-default rate) or extend the scheduled date of any payment
                  thereof or increase the amount or extend the expiration date
                  of any Lender's Commitment, in each case without the written
                  consent of each Lender directly affected thereby (it being
                  understood and agreed that changes to the financial
                  definitions and financial covenants herein shall only require
                  the consent of the Required Lenders and waivers of mandatory
                  prepayments of the Loans required pursuant to Section 2.8(b)
                  hereof shall not constitute increases in the Commitment of any
                  Lender or extensions of the scheduled date of any payments to
                  any Lender); or

                           (ii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section
                  2.13 or this Section 9.1, or reduce the percentage specified
                  in the definition of Required Lenders, without the written
                  consent of all the Lenders; or

                           (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Article
                  VIII without the written consent of the then Administrative
                  Agent; or

                           (iv) release all or any substantial portion of the
                  Guarantors from their obligations under the Guaranty without
                  the written consent of all of the Lenders; or

                  any two of such Loans), or the order of application of
                  payments specified in Section 2.8 without the consent of, if
                  affected thereby, (i) Lenders holding greater than 50% of the
                  Revolving-1 Committed Amount, (ii) Lenders holding greater
                  than 50% of the outstanding Tranche A-1 Term Loans and (iii)
                  Lenders holding greater than 50% of the outstanding Tranche
                  B-1 Term Loans.

                           (vii) amend, modify or waive the requirement that any
                  issue be resolved or determined with the consent, approval or
                  upon the request of the Required Lenders without the written
                  consent of the Required Lenders, or with the consent, approval
                  or upon the request of all Lenders, without the written
                  consent of all of the Lenders to the change of such voting
                  requirement and, provided, further, that no amendment, waiver
                  or consent affecting the rights or duties of the
                  Administrative Agent or the Issuing Lender under any Credit
                  Document shall in any event be effective, unless in writing
                  and signed by the Administrative Agent and/or the Issuing
                  Lender, as applicable, in addition to the Lenders required
                  hereinabove to take such action.

         Any such waiver, any such amendment, supplement or modification and any
such release shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be binding
upon the Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative
Agent and all future holders of the Notes. In the case of any waiver, the
Borrower, the other Credit Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
shall be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Loans and Notes and other Credit Documents, and any Default or Event
of Default waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or
impair any right consequent thereon.

         Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the consent of
the Credit Parties shall not be required for any amendment, modification or
waiver of the provisions of Article VIII (other than the provisions of Section
8.9); provided, however, that the Administrative Agent will provide written
notice to the Borrower of any such amendment, modification or waiver. In
addition, the Borrower and the Lenders hereby authorize the Administrative Agent
to modify this Credit Agreement by unilaterally amending or supplementing the
Register from time to time in the manner requested by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in order to reflect any assignments or
transfers of the Loans as provided for hereunder; provided, however, that the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of any such modification to
the Borrower and each Lender.

         Notwithstanding the fact that the consent of all the Lenders is
required in certain circumstances as set forth above, (x) each Lender is
entitled to vote as such Lender sees fit on any bankruptcy reorganization plan
that affects the Loans, and each Lender acknowledges that the provisions of
Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code supersede the unanimous consent
provisions set forth herein and (y) the Required Lenders may consent to allow a
Credit Party to use cash collateral in the context of a bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding.

         No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the

                                      113

privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges
provided by law.

         SECTION 9.4 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any document;,
certificate or statement delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Notes and the

terminate on the date upon which the Commitments have been terminated and all
amounts owing hereunder and under any Notes have been paid in full.

         SECTION 9.5 PAYMENT OF EXPENSES AND TAXES.

The Credit Parties agree (a) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent for
all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the development, preparation, negotiation, printing and execution of, and any
amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith,
and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, together with the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to
the Administrative Agent, (b) to pay or reimburse each Lender and the
Administrative Agent for all its costs and expenses incurred in connection with
the enforcement or preservation of any rights under this Agreement, the Notes
and any such other documents, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent and to the Lenders
(including reasonable allocated costs of in-house legal counsel), (c) on demand,
to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender and the Administrative Agent harmless
from, any and all recording and filing fees and any and all liabilities with
respect to, or resulting from any delay in paying, stamp, excise and other

modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, the Credit
Documents and any such other documents, and (d) to pay, indemnify, and hold each

performance and administration of the Credit Documents and any such other
documents and the use, or proposed use, of proceeds of the Loans (all of the
foregoing, collectively, the "indemnified liabilities"); provided, however, that
the Borrower shall not have any obligation hereunder to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender with respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any such Lender,
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. The agreements in this
Section 9.5 shall survive repayment or assignment of the Loans, Notes and all
other amounts payable hereunder.

         SECTION 9.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS; PARTICIPATIONS; PURCHASING LENDERS.

                  (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
         benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all
         future holders of the Notes and their





                                      114
<PAGE>

         respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not
         assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
         Agreement or the other Credit Documents without the prior written
         consent of each Lender.

                  (b) Any Lender may, without notice to or consent of the
         Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in the ordinary course of its
         commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable law, at
         any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
         participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held
         by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender, or any other interest of
         such Lender hereunder; (provided, however, that no settlement date
         relating to any such sale shall occur prior to the date which is one
         Business Day after the Funding Date).. In the event of any such sale by
         a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such Lender's
         obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement
         shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for
         the performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any
         such Note for all purposes under this Agreement, and the Borrower and
         the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly
         with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement. No Lender shall transfer or grant any
         participation under which the Participant shall have rights to approve
         any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit
         Document except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend
         the scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note, or extend the expiry date
         of any Letter of Credit in which such Participant is participating
         beyond the Maturity Date, or any installment thereon in which such
         Participant is participating, or reduce the stated rate or extend the
         time of payment of interest or fees thereon (except in connection with
         a waiver of interest at the increased post-default rate) or reduce the
         principal amount thereof, or increase the amount of the Participant's
         participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
         understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default shall not
         constitute a change in the terms of such participation, and that an
         increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without consent
         of any Participant if the Participant's participation is not increased
         as a result thereof), (ii) release all or substantially all of the
         Guarantors from their obligations under the Guaranty, (iii) release all
         or substantially all of the Collateral, or (iv) consent to the
         assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and
         obligations under this Agreement other than in accordance with this
         Agreement. In the case of any such participation, the Participant shall
         not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other Credit
         Documents (the Participant's rights against such Lender in respect of
         such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed by
         such Lender in favor of the Participant relating thereto) and all
         amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if
         such Lender had not sold such participation; provided that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16,
         2.17, 2.18, 2.19 and 9.5 with respect to its participation in the
         Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time, but no
         Participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to
         such Sections than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to
         receive in respect of the amount of the participation transferred by
         such transferor Lender to such Participant had no such transfer
         occurred.

                  (c) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its business and
         in accordance with applicable law, at any time after the Funding Date,
         sell or assign to any Lender, any Affiliate of a Lender or in the case
         of the Tranche A-1 Term Loan or the Tranche B-1 Term Loan, any special
         purpose entity created thereby (including, without limitation, any
         entity which is engaged in investing in bank loans and is administered
         by a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender) or an Approved Fund and with
         the consent of the Administrative Agent (provided, however, that no
         settlement date relating to such sale or assignment shall occur prior
         to the date which is one Business Day after the Funding Date) and, so
         long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Borrower (in each case, which consent shall not be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed), to one or more additional banks, funds or other
         financial institutions ("Purchasing Lenders"), all or any part of its
         rights and obligations under this Agreement and the Notes in minimum
         amounts of (x) $5,000,000 with respect to its Dollar Revolving-1
         Subcommitment and its Dollar Revolving-1 Loans, (y) $5,000,000 with
         respect to its Multi-currency Revolving-1 Subcommitment and its
         Multi-currency Revolving-1 Loans or (z) $1,000,000 with respect to its
         Tranche A-1 Term Loan or Tranche B-1 Term Loan (or, if less, the entire
         amount of such Lender's obligations or such lesser amount agreed to by
         the Borrower and the Administrative Agent), pursuant to a Commitment
         Transfer Supplement, executed by such Purchasing Lender and such
         transferor Lender (and, in the case of a Purchasing Lender that is not
         then a Lender or an affiliate thereof, the Administrative Agent and, so
         long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Borrower), and delivered to the Administrative Agent for its acceptance
         and recording in the Register; provided, however, that any sale or
         assignment to an existing Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or in the
         case of the Tranche A-1 Term Loan or the Tranche B-1 Term Loan, a
         special purpose entity created thereby or an Approved Fund shall not
         require the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower nor
         shall any such sale or assignment be subject to the minimum assignment
         amounts specified herein. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
         recording, from and after the Transfer Effective Date specified in such
         Commitment Transfer Supplement, (x) the Purchasing Lender thereunder
         shall be a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Commitment
         Transfer Supplement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
         hereunder with a Commitment as set forth therein, and (y) the
         transferor Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such
         Commitment Transfer Supplement, be released from its obligations under
         this Agreement (and, in the case of a Commitment Transfer Supplement
         covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Lender shall
         cease to be a party hereto). Such Commitment Transfer Supplement shall
         be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent, and only to the
         extent, necessary to reflect the addition of such Purchasing Lender and
         the resulting adjustment of Commitment Percentages arising from the
         purchase by such Purchasing Lender of all or a portion of the rights
         and obligations of such transferor Lender under this Agreement and the
         Notes. On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date specified in such
         Commitment Transfer Supplement, the Borrower, at its own expense, and
         to the extent requested by the Purchasing Lender shall execute and
         deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the Notes delivered
         to the Administrative Agent pursuant to such Commitment Transfer
         Supplement new Notes to the order of such Purchasing Lender in an
         amount equal to the Commitment assumed by





                                      116
<PAGE>

         it pursuant to such Commitment Transfer Supplement and, unless the
         transferor Lender has not retained a Commitment hereunder, new Notes to
         the order of the transferor Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment
         retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be dated the Closing
         Date and shall otherwise be in the form of the Notes replaced thereby.
         The Notes surrendered by the transferor Lender shall be returned by the
         Administrative Agent to the Borrower marked "canceled".

                  (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
         referred to in Section 9.2 a copy of each Commitment Transfer
         Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
         recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the
         Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender
         from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in
         the absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative
         Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
         the Register as the owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes
         of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
         the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time
         upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (e) Upon its receipt of a duly executed Commitment Transfer
         Supplement, together with payment to the Administrative Agent by the
         transferor Lender or the Purchasing Lender, as agreed between them, of
         a registration and processing fee of $3,500 for each Purchasing Lender
         listed in such Commitment Transfer Supplement and the Notes subject to
         such Commitment Transfer Supplement, the Administrative Agent shall (i)
         accept such Commitment Transfer Supplement, (ii) record the information
         contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice of such
         acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.

                  (f) The Credit Parties authorize each Lender to disclose to
         any Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any
         prospective Transferee any and all financial information in such
         Lender's possession concerning the Credit Parties, their Subsidiaries
         and their Affiliates which has been delivered to such Lender by or on
         behalf of the Credit Parties pursuant to this Agreement or which has
         been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the Credit Parties in
         connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Credit Parties
         and their Affiliates prior to becoming a party to this Agreement, in
         each case subject to Section 9.15.

                  (g) At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section
         9.6 to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is
         not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section
         7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax purposes, the
         respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms
         (and, if applicable, a 2.19 Certificate) described in Section 2.19.

                  (h) Nothing herein shall prohibit any Lender from pledging or
         assigning any of its rights under this Agreement (including, without
         limitation, any right to payment of principal and interest under any
         Note) to any creditor or representative of creditors





                                      117
<PAGE>

         including any assignment to any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with
         applicable laws. In the case of any Lender that is a fund that invests
         in bank loans, such Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or
         Administrative Agent, assign or pledge all or any portion of its
         Tranche A-1 Term Note or its Tranche B-1 Term Note or any other
         instrument evidencing its rights as a Lender under the Tranche A-1 Term
         Loan or Tranche B-1 Term Loan under this Agreement to any trustee for,
         or any other representative of, holders of obligations owed or
         securities issued, by such fund, as security for such obligations or
         securities; provided that any foreclosure or similar action by such
         trustee or representative shall be subject to the provisions of this
         Section 9.6 concerning assignments.

         SECTION 9.7 ADJUSTMENTS; SET-OFF.

                  (a) Each Lender agrees that if any Lender (a "benefited
         Lender") shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its
         Loans, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect
         thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to
         events or proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 7.1(e), or
         otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to or
         collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such
         other Lender's Loans, or interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall
         promptly notify the Administrative Agent thereof, and purchase for cash
         from the other Lenders a participating interest in such portion of each
         such other Lender's Loans, or shall provide such other Lenders with the
         benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be
         necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the excess payment or
         benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of the
         Lenders; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
         payment or benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender,
         such purchase shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits
         returned, to the extent of such recovery, but without interest. The
         Borrower agrees that each Lender so purchasing a portion of another
         Lender's Loans may exercise all rights of payment (including, without
         limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion as fully as
         if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.

                  (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
         provided by law (including, without limitation, other rights of
         set-off), each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the
         Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the
         extent permitted by applicable law, upon the occurrence of any Event of
         Default, to setoff and appropriate and apply any and all deposits
         (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any
         currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any
         currency, in each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or
         contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time held or owing by such
         Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the credit or the
         account of the Borrower, or any part thereof in such amounts as such
         Lender may elect, against and on account of the obligations and
         liabilities of the Borrower to such Lender hereunder and claims of
         every nature and description of such Lender against the Borrower, in
         any currency, whether arising hereunder, under the Notes or under any
         documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein, as such
         Lender may elect, whether or not such Lender has made any demand for
         payment and although such obligations, liabilities and claims may be
         contingent or






                                      118
<PAGE>

         unmatured. The aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such
         Lender against the Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy,
         debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver
         or execution, judgment or attachment creditor of the Borrower, or
         against anyone else claiming through or against the Borrower or any
         such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for the
         benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution, judgment or attachment
         creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of set-off shall not
         have been exercised by such Lender prior to the occurrence of any Event
         of Default. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the
         Administrative Agent after any such set-off and application made by
         such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice
         shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

                  (c) Any amount to be set-off pursuant to clause (b) above may
         be denominated in any Permitted Currency. Any such amount which is
         denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be converted to Dollars in
         an amount equal to the Dollar Amount of such amount at the most
         favorable spot exchange rate determined by the Administrative Agent to
         be available to it; provided that if at the time of any such
         determination no such spot exchange rate can reasonably be determined,
         the Administrative Agent may use any reasonable method as it deems
         applicable to determine such rate, any such determination to be
         conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender and any assignee or
         participant of such Lender in accordance with Section 9.6 are hereby
         authorized by each Borrower to combine currencies, as deemed necessary
         by such Person, in order to effect any set-off pursuant to clause (b)
         above.

         SECTION 9.11 SEVERABILITY.

         Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of

jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

         SECTION 9.12 INTEGRATION.

         This Agreement, the Notes and the other Credit Documents represent the
entire agreement of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders with

Lender relative to the subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred

         SECTION 9.13 GOVERNING LAW.

         This Agreement and the Notes and the rights and obligations of the

         SECTION 9.14 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS.

         All judicial proceedings brought against the Borrower and/or any other
Credit Party with respect to this Agreement, any Note or any of the other Credit

in the State of North Carolina, and., by execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties accepts, for itself
and in connection with its properties, generally and unconditionally, the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and irrevocably agrees to be
bound by any final judgment rendered thereby in connection with this Agreement
from which no appeal has been taken or is available. Each of the Borrower and
the other Credit Parties irrevocably agrees that all service of process in any
such proceedings in any such court may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by
registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail),
postage prepaid, to it at its address set forth in Section 9.2 or at such other
address of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
thereto, such service being hereby acknowledged by each of the Borrower and the
other Credit Parties to be effective and binding service in every respect. To
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, each of the Borrower,
the other Credit Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders irrevocably
waives any objection, including, without limitation, any objection to the laying
of venue or based on the grounds of forum non conveniens which it may now or
hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in any such
jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of any Lender to bring
proceedings against the Borrower or the other Credit Parties in the court of any
other jurisdiction.

(other than to its employees, affiliates, auditors or counsel or to another
Lender) any information with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which
is furnished pursuant to this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein and which is

extent reasonably practicable, (d) to any direct or indirect contractual
counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar agreement (or to any such contractual
counterparty's professional advisor), so long as such contractual counterparty
(or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by the provisions of this
Section 9.15, (e) to any prospective Participant or assignee in connection with

prospective transferee shall have been made aware of this Section 9.15 and shall

         relationship between Administrative Agent and Lenders, on one hand, and
         the Borrower and the other Credit Parties, on the other hand, in
         connection herewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

         SECTION 9.17 WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL.

         THE BORROWER, THE OTHER CREDIT PARTIES, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND
THE LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY





                                      121
<PAGE>

WAIVE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL

may arise in the future in connection with any Dispute.

         SECTION 9.18  BORROWER NAME CHANGE EFFECTIVE ON FUNDING DATE

         It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Borrower will change its
name to Dean Foods Company effective on the Funding Date and from after the

including without limitation, the Notes, shall be deemed to refer to Dean Foods
Company, formerly known as Suiza Foods Corporation, as Borrower.


                                    ARTICLE X
                                    GUARANTY

         Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees as follows:

         SECTION 10.1 THE GUARANTY.

         In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to
extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct benefits to be received
by the Guarantors from the Extensions of Credit hereunder, each of the
Guarantors hereby agrees with the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as
follows: each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably jointly and
severally guarantees as primary obligor and not merely as surety the full and
prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of
any and all indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders. If any or all of the indebtedness of the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders becomes due and payable hereunder, each Guarantor
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders, on order, on demand, together with any and all reasonable
expenses which may be incurred by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in
collecting any of the indebtedness. The word "indebtedness" is used in this
Article X in its most comprehensive sense and includes any and all advances,
debts, obligations and liabilities of the Borrower arising in connection with
this Agreement, including, without limitation, Hedging Obligations permitted
hereunder, in each case, heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or
created, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such
indebtedness is from time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter
increased or incurred, whether the Borrower may be liable individually or
jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such indebtedness may be or
hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations, and whether or not such
indebtedness may be or hereafter become otherwise unenforceable.




                                      122
<PAGE>

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Credit Documents, to the extent the obligations of a Guarantor
shall be adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason (including,
without limitation, because of any applicable state or federal law relating to
fraudulent conveyances or transfers) then the obligations of each such Guarantor
hereunder shall be limited to the maximum amount that is permissible under
applicable law (whether federal or state and including, without limitation, the
Bankruptcy Code).

         SECTION 10.2 BANKRUPTCY.

         Additionally, each of the Guarantors unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees jointly and severally the payment of any and all indebtedness of the
Borrower to the Lenders whether or not due or payable by the Borrower upon the
occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 7.1(e), and unconditionally
promises to pay such indebtedness to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States. Each of
the Guarantors further agrees that to the extent that the Borrower or a
Guarantor shall make a payment or a transfer of an interest in any property to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender, which payment or transfer or any part
thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
or otherwise is avoided, and/or required to be repaid to the Borrower or a
Guarantor, the estate of the Borrower or a Guarantor, a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then to the extent of such avoidance or repayment, the
obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if said payment had not been made.

         SECTION 10.3 NATURE OF LIABILITY.

         The liability of each Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent
of any security for or other guaranty of the indebtedness of the Borrower
whether executed by any such Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other
party, and no Guarantor's liability hereunder shall be affected or impaired by
(a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or by any other
party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or maximum
liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the indebtedness of the
Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or
undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change
in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders on the indebtedness which the Administrative Agent or such
Lenders repay the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and
each of the Guarantors waives any right to the deferral or modification of its
obligations hereunder by reason, of any such proceeding. The obligations of the
Guarantors hereunder are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value,
genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit
Documents, any Hedging Agreement entered into in connection with this Agreement,
or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or a guarantor.




                                      123
<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.4 INDEPENDENT OBLIGATION.

         The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the
obligations of any other Guarantor or the Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not
action is brought against any other Guarantor or the Borrower and whether or not
any other Guarantor or the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.

         SECTION 10.5 AUTHORIZATION.

         Each of the Guarantors authorizes the Administrative Agent and each
Lender without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable
statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing its liability
hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase,
accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise change the
terms of the indebtedness or any part thereof in accordance with this Agreement,
including any increase or decrease of the rate of interest thereon, (b) take and
hold security from any Guarantor or any other party for the payment of this
Guaranty or the indebtedness and exchange, enforce, waive and release any such
security, (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof
as the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in their discretion may determine
and (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the
Borrower or other obligors.

         SECTION 10.6 RELIANCE.

         It is not necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Lenders to
inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors,
partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any
indebtedness made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of such
powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

         SECTION 10.7 WAIVER.

                  (a) Each of the Guarantors waives any right (except as shall
         be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require the
         Administrative Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against the Borrower,
         any other Guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust
         any security held from the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other
         party, or (iii) pursue any other remedy in the Administrative Agent's
         or any Lender's power whatsoever. Each of the Guarantors waives any
         defense based on or arising out of any defense of the Borrower, any
         other Guarantor or any other party other than payment in full of the
         indebtedness, including without limitation any defense based on or
         arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or
         any other party, or the unenforceability of the indebtedness or any
         part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
         liability of the Borrower other than payment in full of the
         indebtedness. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of this
         Article X, each of the Guarantors hereby specifically waives the
         benefits of N.C. Gen. Stat. Section 26-7 through 26-9, inclusive. The
         Administrative Agent or any of the Lenders may, at their election,
         foreclose on any security held by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
         by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every
         aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such
         sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or
         remedy the Administrative Agent and any Lender may have





                                      124
<PAGE>

         against the Borrower or any other party, or any security, without
         affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Guarantor
         hereunder except to the extent the indebtedness has been paid. Each of
         the Guarantors waives any defense arising out of any such election by
         the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders, even though such
         election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
         subrogation or other right or remedy of the Guarantors against the
         Borrower or any other party or any security.

                  (b) Each of the Guarantors waives all presentments, demands
         for performance, protests and notices, including without limitation
         notices of nonperformance, notice of protest, notices of dishonor,
         notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence,
         creation or incurring of new or additional indebtedness. Each Guarantor
         assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of
         each of the Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of all other
         circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the indebtedness
         and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Guarantor
         assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither the
         Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to advise such
         Guarantor of information known to it regarding such circumstances or
         risks.

                  (c) Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees it will not exercise
         any rights of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a
         result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the
         U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Lenders
         against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the indebtedness of the
         Borrower owing to the Lenders (collectively,. the "Other Parties") and
         all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement,
         contribution or indemnity from any Other Party which it may at any time
         otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty until such time as the
         Loans hereunder shall have been paid and the Commitments have been
         terminated. Each of the Guarantors hereby further agrees not to
         exercise any right to enforce any other remedy which the Administrative
         Agent and the Lenders now have or may hereafter have against any Other
         Party, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of the
         indebtedness of the Borrower and any benefit of, and any right to
         participate in, any security or collateral given to or for the benefit
         of the Lenders to secure payment of the indebtedness of the Borrower
         until such time as the Loans hereunder shall have been paid and the
         Commitments have been terminated.

         SECTION 10.8 LIMITATION ON ENFORCEMENT.

         The Lenders agree that this Guaranty may be enforced only by the action
of the Administrative Agent acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders
and that no Lender shall have any right individually to seek to enforce or to
enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the
Lenders upon the terms of this Agreement. The Lenders further agree that this
Guaranty may not be enforced against any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Guarantors.




                                      125
<PAGE>

         SECTION 10.9 CONFIRMATION OF PAYMENT.

         The Administrative Agent and the Lenders will, upon request after
payment of the indebtedness and obligations which are the subject of this
Guaranty and termination of the commitments relating thereto, confirm to the
Borrower, the Guarantors or any other Person that such indebtedness and
obligations have been paid and the commitments relating thereto terminated,
subject to the provisions of Section 10.2.
