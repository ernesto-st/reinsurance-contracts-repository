taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, reserves or
withholdings imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority, which are imposed, enacted or become effective after the
date hereof (such non-excluded taxes being referred to collectively as "Loan
                                                                        ----
Taxes"), excluding income and franchise taxes and taxes of a similar nature
-----
based, imposed on or measured by Lender's net income by the United States of
America or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein
(including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands) or by any other jurisdiction
or Governmental Authority. If any Loan Taxes are required to be withheld from
any amounts payable to Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to Lender shall
be increased to the extent necessary to yield to Lender (after payment of all
Loan Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rate or
in the amounts specified hereunder. Whenever any Loan Tax is payable pursuant to
applicable law by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter, Borrower shall
send to Lender an original official receipt, if available, or certified copy
thereof showing payment of such Loan Tax. Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender for
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by Lender
which may result from any failure by Borrower to pay any such Loan Tax when due
to the appropriate taxing authority or any failure by Borrower to remit to
Lender the required receipts or other required documentary evidence.

          (b) In the event that any change in any requirement of law or in the
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by Lender with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) hereafter issued from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority:

        (i)    shall hereafter impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
               special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against
               assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the
               account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or
               any other acquisition of funds by, any office of Lender which is
               not otherwise included in the determination of LIBOR hereunder
               (but only to the extent that the same relate to LIBOR-based
               loans);

        (ii)   shall hereafter have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
               Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to
               a level below that which Lender could have achieved but for such
               adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
               Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by any amount
               deemed by Lender to be material; or

                                       21
<PAGE>

        (iii)  shall hereafter impose on Lender any other condition on the
               making or origination of LIBOR-based loans and the result of any
               of the foregoing is to increase the cost to Lender of making,
               renewing or maintaining LIBOR-based real estate secured loans or
               extensions of credit or to reduce any amount receivable
               hereunder;

then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay Lender, upon demand, any
additional amounts necessary to compensate Lender for such additional cost or
reduced amount receivable which Lender deems to be material as reasonably
determined by Lender.  If Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.2.3(b), Lender shall provide Borrower with
not less than thirty (30) days written notice specifying in reasonable detail
the event by reason of which it has become so entitled and the additional amount
required to fully compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount.
A certificate as to any additional costs or amounts payable pursuant to the
foregoing sentence submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.  This provision shall survive payment of the Note and
the satisfaction of all other obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and
the Loan Documents.

          (c) In the event that Lender shall have determined on a non-
discriminatory basis (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
Borrower absent manifest error), that by reason of circumstances affecting the
interbank eurodollar market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining LIBOR, then Lender shall, by notice to Borrower ("Lender's

spread (the "Substitute Spread"), taking into account the size of the Loan and
             -----------------
the creditworthiness of Borrower, above a published index used for variable rate
loans as reasonably determined by Lender (the "Substitute Rate"). If any change

in law, or any change in the interpretation of any existing law or future law or
application thereof, shall hereafter make it unlawful for Lender to make or
maintain the Loan at LIBOR plus the Spread applicable to each Component as
contemplated hereunder, (i) the obligation of Lender hereunder to make the Loan
at LIBOR plus the Spread applicable to each Component shall be cancelled
forthwith and (ii) Lender may give Borrower a Lender's Notice, establishing the
Applicable Interest Rate at the Substitute Rate plus the Substitute Spread as
applied to each Component, in which case the Applicable Interest Rate shall be a
rate equal to the Substitute Rate in effect from time to time plus the
Substitute Spread applicable to each Component. If permitted by law, any change
pursuant to this Section 2.2.3(c) shall not become effective until the
expiration of the then current Interest Period.

          2.2.6 Payments after Default. In the event that, and for so long as,
                ----------------------
any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (a) the outstanding
principal balance of the Loan shall accrue interest at the Default Rate,
calculated from the date the Default occurred which led to such an Event of
Default without regard to any grace or cure periods contained herein other than
the grace period with respect to payments of Debt Service set forth in Section
8.1(a)(i) and (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
payments of Net Cash Flow After Debt Service required to be made by Borrower
pursuant to Section 7.3 hereof may be applied by Lender to the payment of the
Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion, including,
without limitation, alternating applications thereof between interest and
principal. Interest at the Default Rate and Net Cash Flow After Debt Service
shall both be computed from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the
actual receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then
due). To the extent permitted by applicable law, interest at the Default Rate
shall be added to the Debt, shall itself accrue interest at the weighted average
of the Applicable Interest Rate with respect to each of the Components and be
secured by the Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement
or privilege to extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of
any other right or remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any
Event of Default; the acceptance of any payment of Net Cash Flow After Debt
Service shall not be deemed to cure or constitute a waiver of any Event of
Default; and Lender retains its rights under the Note to accelerate and to
continue to demand payment of the Debt upon the happening of any Event of
Default, despite any payment of Net Cash Flow After Debt Service. If all or any
part of the principal amount of the Loan is prepaid upon acceleration of the
Loan following the occurrence of an Event of Default prior to the Permitted
Prepayment Date, Borrower shall be required to pay Lender, in addition to all
other amounts then payable hereunder, the Prepayment Fee calculated with respect
to the amount of principal being repaid.

          2.2.7  Late Payment Charge.  If any principal, interest or any other
                 -------------------
sums due under the Loan Documents is not paid by Borrower on or before the date
on which it is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon demand, an amount equal
to the lesser of five percent (5%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law in order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in
handling and processing such delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the
loss of the use of such delinquent payment.  Any such amount shall be secured by
the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable
law.

          2.2.8   Usury Savings.  This Agreement and the Note are subject to the
                  -------------
express condition that at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay
interest on the principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject
Lender to either civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of
the Maximum Legal Rate.  If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, Borrower is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the
principal balance due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate,
the Applicable Interest Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous
payments in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been
payments in reduction of principal and not on account of the interest due
hereunder.  All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for the use,
forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread
throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment in full so that the
rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum
Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan
for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

Borrower's annual financial statements, Borrower shall furnish to Lender an
Officer's Certificate certifying as of the date thereof whether there exists an
event or circumstance which constitutes a Default or Event of Default under the
Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower, and if

before thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter the following
items, accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial officer of Borrower
or the general partner or managing member of Borrower, as applicable, stating
that such items are true, correct, accurate, and complete and fairly present the
financial condition and results of the operations of Borrower and the Properties
on a combined basis as well as each Individual Property (subject to normal year-
end adjustments): (i) a rent roll accompanied by an Officer's Certificate with
respect thereto; (ii) monthly and year-to-date operating statements (including
Capital Expenditures) prepared for each calendar month, noting Net Operating
Income, Gross Income from Operations, and Operating Expenses (not including any
contributions to the Replacement Reserve Fund), and other information necessary
and sufficient to fairly represent the financial position and results of
operation of the Properties during such calendar quarter, and containing a
comparison of budgeted income and expenses and the actual income and expenses
together with a detailed explanation of any variances of ten percent (10%) or
more between budgeted and actual amounts for such periods (provided, such
detailed explanation of variances shall not be required in the

                                       49
<PAGE>

event that the amount of income and/or expenses does not exceed $25,000), all in
form satisfactory to Lender; (iii) a calculation reflecting the annual Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period as
of the last day of such month accompanied by an Officer's Certificate with
respect thereto; and (iv) a Net Cash Flow Schedule. In addition, such
certificate shall also be accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial
officer of Borrower or the general partner or managing member of Borrower, as
applicable, stating that the representations and warranties of Borrower set
forth in Section 4.1.30(e) are true and correct as of the date of such
certificate and that there are no trade payables outstanding for more than sixty
(60) days.

          (d) For the partial year period commencing on the date hereof, and for
each Fiscal Year thereafter, Borrower shall submit to Lender an Annual Budget
not later than sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of such period or
Fiscal Year in form reasonably satisfactory to Lender. The Annual Budget shall
be subject to Lender's written approval (each such Annual Budget, an "Approved
Annual Budget"). In the event that Lender objects to a proposed Annual Budget
submitted by Borrower, Lender shall advise Borrower of such objections within
fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof (and deliver to Borrower a reasonably
detailed description of such objections) and Borrower shall promptly revise such
Annual Budget and resubmit the same to Lender. Lender shall advise Borrower of
any objections to such revised Annual Budget within ten (10) days after receipt
thereof (and deliver to Borrower a reasonably detailed description of such
objections) and Borrower shall promptly revise the same in accordance with the
process described in this subsection until Lender approves the Annual Budget.
Until such time that Lender approves a proposed Annual Budget, the most recently
Approved Annual Budget shall apply; provided that, such Approved Annual Budget
shall be adjusted to reflect actual increases in real estate taxes, insurance
premiums and utilities expenses.

          (e) In the event that Borrower must incur an extraordinary operating
expense or capital expense not set forth in the Approved Annual Budget (each an
"Extraordinary Expense"), then Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender a
reasonably detailed explanation of such proposed Extraordinary Expense for
Lender's approval.

          (f) Borrower shall furnish to Lender, within ten (10) Business Days

further detailed information with respect to the operation of the Properties and
the financial affairs of Borrower as may be reasonably requested by Lender.

          (g) Any reports, statements or other information required to be
delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered in electronic form and
prepared using a Microsoft Word for Windows, WordPerfect for Windows or Excel
files (which files may be prepared using a spreadsheet program and saved as word
processing files) or in paper form if a signature is required or electronic form

          5.1.20  Leasing Matters.  Any Leases with respect to an Individual

Property written after the date hereof for more than 10,000 square feet and any

be approved by Lender, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.  Upon
request, Borrower shall furnish Lender with executed copies of all Leases.  All
renewals of Leases and all proposed Leases shall provide for rental rates
comparable to existing local market rates.  All proposed Leases shall be on

a second request for such approval

                                       52
<PAGE>

and, provided that such second request contains a bold faced, conspicuous legend
at the top of the first page thereof to the effect that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND
TO THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) BUSINESS DAYS, YOUR
APPROVAL SHALL BE DEEMED GIVEN," and Lender fails to respond to such request for
approval ten (10) Business Days after Lender has received from Borrower such
second request and all information reasonably required by Lender in order to

any alterations to any Improvements, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld except with respect to alterations that may have a material adverse
effect on Borrower's financial condition, the value of the applicable Individual
Property or the Net Operating Income. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender's
consent shall not be required in connection with any alterations that will not
have a material adverse effect on Borrower's financial condition, the value of
the applicable Individual Property or the Net Operating Income, provided that
such alterations are made in connection with (a) tenant improvement work
performed pursuant to the terms of any Lease executed on or before the date
hereof, (b) tenant improvement work performed pursuant to the terms and
provisions of a Lease and not adversely affecting any structural component of
any Improvements, any utility or HVAC system contained in any Improvements or
the exterior of any building constituting a part of any Improvements, or (c)
alterations performed in connection with the restoration of an Individual
Property after the occurrence of a casualty in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.  If the total unpaid amounts with respect to
alterations to the Improvements at any Individual Property (other than such
amounts to be paid or reimbursed by tenants under the Leases) shall at any time
exceed * Dollars ($*) (the "Threshold Amount"), Borrower shall promptly deliver
                           ------------------
to Lender as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional security
for Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the following: (A)
cash, (B) U.S. Obligations, (C) other securities having a rating acceptable to
Lender and that the applicable Rating Agencies have confirmed in writing will
not, in and of itself, result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
initial, or, if higher, then current ratings assigned in connection with any
Securitization, or (D) a completion bond or letter of credit issued by a
financial institution having a rating by S&P of not less than A-1+ if the term
of such bond or letter of credit is no longer than three (3) months or, if such
term is in excess of three (3) months, issued by a financial institution having
a rating that is acceptable to Lender and that the applicable Rating Agencies
have confirmed in writing will not, in and of itself, result in a downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then current ratings
assigned in connection with any Securitization. Such security shall be in an
amount equal to the excess of the total unpaid amounts with respect to
alterations to the Improvements on the applicable Individual Property (other
than such amounts to be paid or reimbursed by tenants under the Leases) over the
Threshold Amount and applied from time to time at the option of Lender to pay
for such alterations or to terminate any of the alterations and restore the
applicable Individual Property to the extent necessary to prevent any material
adverse effect on the value of such Individual Property.

Personal Property, including contingent liability from Operation of Building
Laws, Demolition Costs and Increased Cost of Construction Endorsements, in each
case (A) in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the "Full

no event be less than the outstanding principal balance of the Loan; (B)
containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect to the Improvements and

policy required under this subsection (i).

          (ii) commercial general liability insurance against claims for

such Individual Property) for * period. All proceeds payable to Lender pursuant
to this subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be applied to the
obligations secured by the Loan Documents from time to time due and payable
hereunder and under the Note; provided, however, that nothing herein contained
                              --------  -------
shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations
secured by the Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment provided for in
the Note and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such amounts are
actually paid out of the proceeds of such business income insurance;

          (iv)  at all times during which structural construction, repairs or

<PAGE>

          (b) All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) shall be obtained
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "Policies" or in the
singular, the "Policy"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to
insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The
Policies shall be issued by financially sound and responsible insurance
companies authorized to do business in the State and having a claims paying
ability rating of "AA" or better by at least two (2) of the Rating Agencies one
of which shall be Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. The Policies described in
Section 6.1 (other than those strictly limited to liability protection) shall
designate Lender as loss payee. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the
expiration dates of the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender, certificates
of insurance evidencing the Policies accompanied by evidence satisfactory to
Lender of payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "Insurance Premiums"),
shall be delivered by Borrower to Lender.

          (c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the
Individual Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder
and shall otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy
insuring only the Properties in compliance with the provisions of Section
6.1(a).

          (d) All Policies of insurance provided for or contemplated by Section
6.1(a), except for the Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(v), shall name
Borrower, or the Tenant, as the insured and Lender as the additional insured, as
its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler and
machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a non-contributing
mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be
payable to Lender.

          (e) All Policies of insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a)(v) shall
contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

              (i)   no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting for
Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply with the
provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the
insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;

              (ii)  the Policy shall not be materially changed (other than to
increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at least thirty (30)
days' written notice to Lender and any other party named therein as an
additional insured;

              (iii) the issuers thereof shall give written notice to Lender if
the Policy has not been renewed fifteen (15) days prior to its expiration; and

              (iv)  Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

          (f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that
all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have
the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Properties, including, without
limitation, the obtaining of such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole
discretion deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with
such action

                                       60
<PAGE>

or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the
Mortgages and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

          Section 6.2 Casualty. If an Individual Property shall be damaged or
                      --------
destroyed, in whole or in part, by fire or other casualty (a "Casualty"),
Borrower shall give prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly
commence and diligently prosecute the completion of the repair and restoration
of the Individual Property as nearly as possible to the condition the Individual
Property was in immediately prior to such fire or other casualty, with such
alterations as may be reasonably approved by Lender (a "Restoration") and
otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4. Borrower shall pay or cause Exodus
Communications, as tenant under the Master Leases, to pay all costs of such
Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender may, but
shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

          Section 6.3 Condemnation. Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice
                      ------------
of the actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation
of any Individual Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all
papers served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any
such proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If any Individual Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning
authority, Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the
Restoration of the applicable Individual Property and otherwise comply with the
provisions of Section 6.4. If any Individual Property is sold, through
foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender
shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the Note shall
have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a portion
thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

          Section 6.4 Restoration. The following provisions shall apply in
                      -----------
connection with the Restoration of any Individual Property:

          (a) If the Net Proceeds shall be less than * Dollars ($*) and the
costs of completing the Restoration shall be less than * Dollars ($*), the Net
Proceeds will be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all
of the conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers
to Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily
complete with due diligence the Restoration in compliance with all applicable

                                       61

laws) and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than * Dollars ($*)
or the costs of completing the Restoration is equal to or greater than * Dollars
($*) Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4. The term "Net Proceeds" for
purposes of this Section 6.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance
proceeds received by Lender pursuant to Section 6.1 (a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (ix)
as a result of such damage or destruction, after deduction of its reasonable
costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if
any, in collecting same ("Insurance Proceeds"), or (ii) the net amount of the
Award, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting same ("Condemnation
Proceeds"), whichever the case may be.

              (i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for
     Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                  (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

                  (B) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance Proceeds,
             less than * percent (*%) of the total floor area of the
             Improvements on the Individual Property has been damaged, destroyed
             or rendered unusable as a result of such fire or other casualty or
             (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less
             than * percent (*%) of the land constituting the Individual
             Property is taken, and such land is located along the perimeter or
             periphery of the Individual Property, and no portion of the
             Improvements is located on such land;

                  (C) Leases demising in the aggregate a percentage amount equal
             to or greater than the Rentable Space Percentage of the total
             rentable space in the Individual Property which has been demised
             under executed and delivered Leases in effect as of the date of the
             occurrence of such fire or other casualty or taking, whichever the
             case may be, shall remain in full force and effect during and after
             the completion of the Restoration, notwithstanding the occurrence
             of any such fire or other casualty or taking, whichever the case
             may be, and will make all necessary repairs and restorations
             thereto at their sole cost and expense. The term "Rentable Space
                                                               --------------
             Percentage" shall mean (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are
             ----------
             Insurance Proceeds, a percentage amount equal to * percent (*%)
             and (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, a
             percentage amount equal to seventy five percent (75%);

                  (D) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon as
             reasonably practicable (but in no event later than sixty (60) days
             after such damage or destruction or taking, whichever the case may
             be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to satisfactory
             completion;

                  (E) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits,
             including all scheduled payments of principal and interest under
             the Note, which will be incurred with respect to the Individual
             Property as a result of the occurrence of any such fire or other
             casualty or taking, whichever the case may be, will be covered out
             of (1) the Net Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage referred to in
             Section 6.1(a)(iii), if applicable, or (3) by other funds of
             Borrower;

                  (F) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration will be
             completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1) the Maturity
             Date, (2) the earliest date required for such completion under the
             terms of any Leases, (3) such time as may be required under
             applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation in order to
             repair and restore the applicable Individual Property to the
             condition it was in immediately prior to such fire or other
             casualty or to as nearly as possible the condition it was in
             immediately prior to such taking, as applicable or (4) the
             expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
             6.1(a)(iii);

                  (G) the Individual Property and the use thereof after the
             Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
             applicable zoning laws, ordinances, rules and regulations;

                  (H) the Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower in
             an expeditious and diligent fashion and in compliance with all
             applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations (including,
             without limitation, all applicable environmental laws); and

                  (I) such fire or other casualty or taking, as applicable, does
             not result in the loss of access to the Individual Property or the
             related Improvements.

              (ii) The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an interest-
     bearing account and, until disbursed in accordance with the provisions of
     this Section 6.4(b), shall constitute additional security for the Debt and
     other obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net Proceeds shall be
     disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from time to time
     during the course of the Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory
     to Lender that (A) all materials installed and work and labor performed
     (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested
     disbursement) in connection with the Restoration have been paid for in
     full, and (B) there exist no notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's
     or materialman's liens or notices of intention to file same, or any other

<PAGE>

     independent consulting engineer selected by Lender (the "Casualty
     Consultant"). Lender shall have the use of the plans and specifications and
     all permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with
     the Restoration. The identity of the contractors, subcontractors and
     materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as the contracts under
     which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review and
     acceptance by Lender and the Casualty Consultant. All costs and expenses
     incurred by Lender in connection with making the Net Proceeds available for
     the Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
     disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
     Borrower.

              (iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements
     of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually
     incurred from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as
     certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the Casualty Retainage. The
                                           -----
     term "Casualty Retainage" shall mean an amount equal to ten percent (10%)
     of the costs actually incurred for work in place as part of the
     Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, until the Restoration
     has been completed. The Casualty Retainage shall in no event, and
     notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section
     6.4(b), be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower from
     contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
     Casualty Retainage shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant
     certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed in accordance
     with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary
     for the re-occupancy and use of the Individual Property have been obtained
     from all appropriate governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, and
     Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
     Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
     Casualty Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the portion
                         --------  -------
     of the Casualty Retainage being held with respect to any contractor,
     subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon
     which the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor,
     subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and has
     supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions of the
     contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the contractor,
     subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence of
     payment in full of all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or
     materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or by the title
     company issuing the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender receives an
     endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy insuring the continued priority
     of the lien of the related Mortgage and evidence of payment of any premium
     payable for such endorsement. If required by Lender, the release of any
     such portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety
     company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with
     respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

              (v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
     Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

              (vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance
     thereof shall not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation with the
     Casualty Consultant, be sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs
     which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to be

                                       64
<PAGE>

     incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration, Borrower
     shall deposit the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency") with Lender
     before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall be made. The Net
     Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held by Lender and shall
     be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with the Restoration
     on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net Proceeds,
     and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute
     additional security for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan
     Documents.

          (vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining
     balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after
     the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
     completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), and the
     receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
     incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full, shall
     be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default shall have
     occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this Agreement or any of
     the other Loan Documents.

          (c) All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 6.4(b)(vii) may be retained and applied by Lender toward the payment
of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority and
proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, at the
discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to
Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall designate, in its discretion.

          (d) In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage with respect to the
Individual Property, or other transfer of title to the Individual Property in
extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all right, title and interest of
Borrower in and to the Policies that are not blanket Policies then in force
concerning the Individual Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall
thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender or other
transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.

          Section 7.2  Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund
                       -----------------------------

          Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of
the Taxes that Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve
(12) months in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such
Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to their respective due dates, and (b)
one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that Lender estimates will be payable for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance
Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Policies (said
amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called the "Tax and Insurance Escrow
Fund").  The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and the payments of interest or
principal or both, payable pursuant to the Note, shall be added together and
shall be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender.  Lender will apply

                                       65
<PAGE>

the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums
required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof and under the
Mortgages. In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund,
Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the
appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with
respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill,
statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance
Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof, Lender shall, in its reasonable
discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future
payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. Any amount remaining
in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund after the Debt has been paid in full shall
be returned to Borrower. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the
Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and
Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall
notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall increase its monthly
payments to Lender by the amount that Lender estimates is sufficient to make up
the deficiency at least thirty (30) days prior to delinquency of the Taxes
and/or thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the Policies, as the case may be.

          Section 7.4  Reserve Funds, Generally.
                       ------------------------

          Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security interest
in each of the Reserve Funds and any and all monies now or hereafter deposited
in each Reserve Fund as additional security for payment of the Debt.  Until
expended or applied in accordance herewith, the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Lender may, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available to
Lender, apply any sums then present in any or all of the Reserve Funds to the
payment of the Debt in any order in its sole discretion.  The Reserve Funds
shall not constitute trust funds and may be commingled with other monies held by
Lender.  The Reserve Funds shall be held in interest bearing accounts and all
earnings or interest on a Reserve Fund shall be added to and become a part of
such Reserve Fund and shall be disbursed in the same manner as other monies
deposited in such Reserve Fund.  Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior
consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any
Reserve Fund or the monies deposited therein or permit any lien or encumbrance
to attach thereto, or any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing
Statements, except those naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with
respect thereto.  Lender shall not be liable for any loss sustained on the
investment of any funds constituting the Replacement Reserve Fund.

              (ii)  if any of the Taxes or Other Charges are not paid when the
same are due and payable;

Properties without Lender's prior consent or otherwise violates the provisions
of Article 5.2.13 of this Agreement;

              (v)   if any representation or warranty made by Borrower herein or
in any other Loan Document, or in any report, certificate, financial statement
or other instrument, agreement or document furnished to Lender shall have been
false or misleading in any material respect as of the date the representation or
warranty was made;

              (vi)  if Borrower or any guarantor under any guaranty issued in
connection with the Loan shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors;

              (vii) if a receiver, liquidator or trustee shall be appointed for
Borrower or Exodus Communications or if Borrower or Exodus Communications shall
be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or if any petition for bankruptcy,
reorganization or arrangement pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar
federal or state law, shall be filed by or against, consented to, or acquiesced
in by, Borrower or Exodus Communications, or if any proceeding for the
dissolution or liquidation of Borrower or Exodus Communications shall be
instituted; provided, however, if such appointment, adjudication, petition or
            --------  -------
proceeding was involuntary and not consented to by Borrower or Exodus
Communications, upon the same not being discharged, stayed or dismissed within
sixty (60) days;

              (viii) if Borrower attempts to assign its rights under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any interest herein or therein
in contravention of the Loan Documents;

herein which specifically contains a notice requirement or grace period, if

other terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement not specified in
subsections (i) to (xi) above, for ten (10) days after notice to Borrower from
Lender, in the case of any Default which can be cured by the payment of a sum of
money, or for thirty (30) days after notice from Lender in the case of any other
Default; provided, however, that if such non-monetary Default is susceptible of
         --------  -------
cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period and provided
further that Borrower shall have commenced to cure such Default within such 30-
day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the
same, such 30-day period shall be extended for such time as is reasonably
necessary for Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such Default,
such additional period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) days;

              (xiii) if there shall be a default under any of the other Loan
Documents beyond any applicable cure periods contained in such documents,
whether as to Borrower or any Individual Property, or if any other such event
shall occur or condition shall exist, if the effect of such event or condition
is to accelerate the maturity of any portion of the Debt or to permit Lender to
accelerate the maturity of all or any portion of the Debt;

              (xiv) if there shall occur any "Event of Default" under any of
the Master Leases (as such term is defined therein);

shall fail to make any payment of any principal of or premium or interest on any
Indebtedness that is outstanding in a principal or notional amount of at least
$* in the aggregate (but excluding Indebtedness outstanding hereunder)
when the same becomes due and payable (whether by scheduled maturity, required
prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise), and such failure shall continue
after the applicable grace period, if any, specified in the agreement or
instrument relating to such Indebtedness; or (b) any other event shall occur or
condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating to any such
Indebtedness and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any,
specified in such agreement or instrument if the effect of such event or
condition is to accelerate, or to permit the acceleration of, the maturity of
such Indebtedness; or (c) any such Indebtedness shall be declared to be due and
payable, or required to be prepaid or redeemed (other than by a regularly
scheduled required prepayment or redemption), purchased or defeased, or an offer
to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease such Indebtedness shall be required to be
made, in each case prior to the stated maturity thereof; provided that this
                                                         --------
clause (xvi) shall not apply to secured Indebtedness that becomes due and
payable solely as a result of a voluntary sale or transfer of the property and
assets securing such Indebtedness.

          (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above) and at any time
thereafter, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant
to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, Lender
may take such action, without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to
protect and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to all or any
Individual Property, including, without limitation, declaring the Debt to be
immediately due and payable, and Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or
all rights or remedies provided in the Loan Documents against Borrower and any
or all of the Properties, including, without limitation, all rights or remedies
available at law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described in
clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the Debt and all other obligations of
Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and
automatically become due and payable, without notice or demand, and Borrower
hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything contained herein or
in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

          Section 8.2  Remedies.
                       --------
          (a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more
of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and
delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised
by Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the
Debt shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have
commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its
rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to all or any
Individual Property. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and
concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its sole
discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law,

without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender
permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees
that if an Event of Default is continuing (i) Lender is not subject to any "one
action" or "election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other
rights, remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and
effect until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against the Properties and
each Mortgage has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in full.

          (b) With respect to Borrower and the Properties, nothing contained
herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to
resort to any Individual Property for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in
preference or priority to any other Individual Property, and Lender may seek
satisfaction out of all of the Properties or any part thereof, in its absolute
discretion in respect of the Debt. In addition, Lender shall have the right from
time to time to partially foreclose the Mortgages in any manner and for any
amounts secured by the Mortgages then due and payable as determined by Lender in
its sole discretion including, without limitation, the following circumstances:
(i) in the event Borrower defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the
payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may
foreclose one or more of the Mortgages to recover such delinquent payments, or
(ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding
principal balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more of the Mortgages
to recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate
and such other sums secured by one or more of the Mortgages as Lender may elect.
Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Properties shall remain
subject to the Mortgages to secure payment of sums secured by the Mortgages and
not previously recovered.

          (c) Lender shall have the right from time to time to sever the Note
and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages and
other security documents (the "Severed Loan Documents") in such denominations as
Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of evidencing and
enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and
deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a
severance agreement and such other documents as Lender shall request in order to
effect the severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and
irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an
interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or
desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying all that its
said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided, however, Lender shall not
                                          --------  -------
make or execute any such documents under such power until three (3) days after
notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender's intent to exercise its
rights under such power. Except as may be required in connection with a
securitization pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, (i) Borrower shall not be
obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution, recording or filing of the Severed Loan Documents, and
(ii) the Severed Loan Documents shall not contain any representations,
warranties or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such
representations and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be
given by Borrower only as of the Closing Date.

          Section 8.3  Remedies Cumulative; Waivers.
                       ----------------------------

          The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  Lender's rights,
powers and remedies may be pursued singly, concurrently or otherwise, at such
time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion.  No
delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event
of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as
a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient.  A waiver of one Default or
Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver
of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any
remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

                   as to non-consolidation, fraudulent conveyance, and true sale
                   and/or lease or any other opinion customary in securitization
                   transactions, which counsel and opinions shall be reasonably
                   satisfactory to the Lender and the Rating Agencies;

          (c)      make such representations and warranties as of the closing
                   date of the Securitization with respect to the Properties,
                   Borrower, and the Loan Documents as are customarily provided
                   in securitization transactions and

                   Agencies and consistent with the facts covered by such
                   representations and warranties as they exist on the date
                   thereof, including the representations and warranties made in

a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under
this Section 9.2, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will not relieve
the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying party may have
to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that failure to notify
causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that any action is
brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, jointly with
any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and, to the extent that it
(or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the indemnified party
promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such indemnified party, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party.
After notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party under this
Section 9.2 the indemnifying party shall not be responsible for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided,
however, if the defendants in any such action include both the indemnified party
and the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there are any legal defenses available to it and/or other
indemnified parties that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party to
parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more
than one such separate counsel unless an indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to another indemnified party.

          (e) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 9.2(b)
or (c) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an indemnified party
in respect of any Liabilities (or action in respect thereof) referred to therein
which would otherwise be indemnifiable under Section 9.2(b) or (c), the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of
                            --------  -------
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of
contribution to which the respective parties are entitled, the following factors
shall be considered: (i) Lehman's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access
to information concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted;
(ii) the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii)
any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

          (f) The liabilities and obligations of both Borrower and Lender under
this Section 9.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

          Section 9.4  Exculpation.
                       -----------

          Subject to the qualifications below, Lender shall not enforce the
liability and obligation of Borrower to perform and observe the obligations
contained in the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents
by any action or proceeding wherein a money judgment shall be sought against
Borrower (provided further that except to the extent provided by law or as
expressly provided in the Loan Documents, no Affiliate shall be personally
obligated for any debt, obligation or liability of the Borrower whether arising
in contract, tort or otherwise), except that Lender may bring a foreclosure
action, an action for specific performance or any other appropriate action or
proceeding to enable Lender to enforce and realize upon its interest under the
Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, or in the
Properties, the Rents, or any other collateral given to Lender pursuant to the
Loan Documents; provided, however, that, except as specifically provided herein,
                --------  -------
any judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable against
Borrower only to the extent of Borrower's interest in the Properties, in the
Rents and in any other collateral given to Lender, and Lender, by accepting the
Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages and the other Loan Documents, agrees that it
shall not sue for, seek or demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower in
any such action or proceeding under or by reason of or under or in connection
with the Note, this Agreement, the Mortgages or the other Loan Documents.  The
provisions of this section shall not, however, (a) constitute a waiver, release
or impairment of any obligation evidenced or secured by any of the Loan
Documents; (b) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower as a party defendant
in any action or suit for foreclosure and sale under any of the Mortgages; (c)
affect the validity or enforceability of any guaranty made in connection with
the Loan or any of the rights and remedies of Lender thereunder; (d) impair the
right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a receiver; (e) impair the
enforcement of any of the Assignments of Leases; (f) constitute a prohibition
against Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against Borrower in order to fully
realize the security granted by each of the Mortgages or to commence any other
appropriate action or proceeding in order for Lender to exercise its remedies
against all of the Properties; or (g) constitute a waiver of the right of Lender
to enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower, by money judgment or
otherwise, to the extent of any loss, damage, cost, expense, liability, claim or
other obligation incurred by Lender (including attorneys' fees and costs
reasonably incurred) arising out of or in connection with the following:

          (i)   fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower or any
                guarantor in connection with the Loan;

          (ii)  the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Borrower;

          (iii) the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
                indemnification provision in the Environmental Indemnity or in
                the Mortgages concerning

                 collected with respect to the Properties which are not
                 delivered to Lender upon a foreclosure of the Properties or
                 action in lieu thereof, except to the extent any such security
                 deposits were applied in accordance with the terms and
                 conditions of any of the Leases prior to the occurrence of the

the Debt secured by the Mortgages or to require that all collateral shall

Documents, and (B) the Debt shall be fully recourse to Borrower in the event
that: (i) the first full monthly payment of principal and interest under the
Note is not paid when due; (ii) Borrower fails to permit on-site inspections of

in accordance with the terms and provisions of, this Loan Agreement and the
Mortgages; (iii) Borrower fails to obtain Lender's prior consent to any
subordinate financing or other voluntary Lien encumbering any Individual
Property; (iv) Borrower fails to obtain Lender's prior consent to any

bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement pursuant to federal bankruptcy,
reorganization or arrangement pursuant to federal bankruptcy law, or any similar
federal or state law, shall be filed by or consented to by Borrower.

shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the Management Agreement and replace
the Manager with a manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee

addition and in the event no Management Agreement shall then be in existence, if
(a) the Master Lease with respect to the Individual Property shall no longer be
in effect or (b) at the Maturity Date, the Debt is not repaid in full, Borrower
shall, at the request of Lender, enter into a management agreement on terms and
conditions reasonably satisfactory to Lender with a manager reasonably approved
by Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee for such
manager shall not exceed the then prevailing market rates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to the Maturity Date, Borrower shall have no obligation to
enter into any management agreement so long as the Master Leases remain in full
force and effect.

                       --------

          At the option of Lender and at no cost to Borrower, the Loan may be

ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY
TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER EXIST WITH REGARD TO

interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,

          Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or

payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then, to
the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations hereunder or
part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue in full
force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received by
Lender.

          Section 10.11  Waiver of Notice.

Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice.  Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive

agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment, unless Lender shall be
adjudged to have acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner or in bad faith.
The parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether
Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory
judgment.

          Section 10.13  Expenses; Indemnity.
                         -------------------

disbursements) incurred by Lender in connection with (i) the preparation,
negotiation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan

any obligations of or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to the Properties or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable
                           --------  -------

          (b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Lender from and
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,

or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and

any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan

                                               --------  -------

Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or
willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Lender.

          Section 10.14  Schedules Incorporated.
                         ----------------------

          The Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part
of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

          Section 10.15  Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses.
                         -----------------------------------

          Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower
may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated
counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any
action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any
such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

Section 10.16  No Joint Venture or Partnership; No Third Party Beneficiaries.
                                                               --------------

          (a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and
lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Properties other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

          (b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require


                                      87

<PAGE>

satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to
assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of strict
compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

          Section 10.17  Publicity.
                         ---------

          All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents, to
Lender, Lehman, or any of their Affiliates shall be subject to the prior written
approval of Lender.

          Section 10.18 Cross-Default; Cross-Collateralization; Waiver of
                        -------------------------------------------------
                        Marshalling of Assets.
                        ---------------------

          (a) Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan to Borrower
upon the lsecurity of its collective interest in the Properties and in reliance
upon the aggregate of the Properties taken together being of greater value as
collateral security than the sum of each Individual Property taken separately.
Borrower agrees that the Mortgages are and will be cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted with each other so that (i) an Event of Default under any of the
Mortgages shall constitute an Event of Default under each of the other Mortgages
which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of Default under the Note or this Loan
Agreement shall constitute an Event of Default under each Mortgage; and (iii)
each Mortgage shall constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket lien
were placed on all of the Properties as security for the Note.

          (b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and
its successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of
foreclosure of all or any of the Mortgages, and agrees not to assert any right
under any laws pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse
order of alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of
decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right
of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the Properties for the
collection of the Debt without any prior or different resort for collection or
of the right of Lender to the payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the
Properties in preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition,
Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of
foreclosure of any or all of the Mortgages, any equitable right otherwise
available to Borrower which would require the separate sale of the Properties or
require Lender to exhaust its remedies against any Individual Property or any
combination of the Properties before proceeding against any other Individual
Property or combination of Properties; and further in the event of such
foreclosure Borrower does hereby expressly consents to and authorizes, at the
option of Lender, the foreclosure and sale either separately or together of any
combination of the Properties.

          Section 10.19  Waiver of Counterclaim.
                         ----------------------

          Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than
a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

          Section 10.20  Conflict; Construction of Documents; Reliance.
                         ---------------------------------------------

          In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Loan
Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Loan
Agreement shall control.  The parties hereto acknowledge that they were
represented by competent counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting
and execution of the Loan Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be
subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party which
drafted same.  Borrower acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower
shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan
without relying in any manner on any statements, representations or
recommendations of Lender or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender.
Lender shall not be subject to any limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any
rights or remedies available to it under any of the Loan Documents or any other
agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it
or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of
them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right
to raise any defense or take any action on the basis of the foregoing with
respect to Lender's exercise of any such rights or remedies.  Borrower
acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real estate financings and
other real estate transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to
or competitive with the business of Borrower or its Affiliates.

          Section 10.21  Brokers and Financial Advisors.
                         ------------------------------

          Borrower hereby represents that it has dealt with no financial
advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  Borrower
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind (including Lender's
attorneys' fees and expenses) in any way relating to or arising from a claim by
any Person that such Person acted on behalf of Borrower or Lender in connection
with the transactions contemplated herein.  The provisions of this Section 10.21
shall survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and the payment
of the Debt.

          Section 10.22  Prior Agreements.
                         ----------------

          This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written, including, without limitation, the Mortgage
Loan Application dated February 16, 2001 between Borrower and Lender are
superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

the termination or expiration of the Interest Rate Cap Agreement and (ii) the
payment in full of the Debt, and upon such termination Assignee shall promptly
release this Assignment pursuant to a release executed and delivered by Assignee

benefit of Assignor and Assignee and their respective successors and assigns.

          8. This Assignment may be amended or modified only by a written
