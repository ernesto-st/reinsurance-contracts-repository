Additional Cash Deposit, as applicable, within 10&nbsp;days after Acceptance or if Closing does not
occur on or before the Closing Date due to Applicant&#146;s failure to comply with the terms of this
Agreement, then Lender will have the right to retain, as Lender&#146;s sole and exclusive remedy, the
Loan Deposit, which Applicant agrees will be fully earned by Lender as liquidated damages (the
<B>&#147;</B><U><B>Liquidated Damages</B></U><B>&#148;</B>) to compensate Lender in some measure for time spent, services
performed, expenses incurred and losses that Lender may incur. Applicant acknowledges that it
would be extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of Lender&#146;s damages caused by
failure of the Loan to close, and that the Liquidated Damages represent a reasonable estimate of
Lender&#146;s damages and are not a penalty. If any remedy described in this Agreement is denied,
Lender may pursue any alternate remedy at law or in equity.

Compliance Report is conditioned upon remediation of specified conditions, the cost of which
exceeds the greater of 2% of the Loan Amount or $1,000,000 in the aggregate (as reasonably
determined by Lender), and Applicant has determined not to
proceed with the necessary remediation, or (iv)&nbsp;the Closing does not occur on or before the Closing
Date for any other reason (including a termination of this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;20(f)</U> hereof), other than Lender&#146;s willful default or Applicant&#146;s failure to comply with the
terms of this Agreement as set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;18(a)</U>, then, in any such event, Lender
shall give Applicant notice of same and, upon Applicant&#146;s receipt of such notice, this Agreement
shall terminate. Lender&#146;s sole obligation under such circumstances will be to return the Loan
Deposit to Applicant, together with (A)&nbsp;the excess of the Consultant Fees over the aggregate actual
costs of the Consultants&#146; Inspections and Reports, and (B)&nbsp;the excess of the Legal Fee Retainer
over the reasonable Lender Legal Fees incurred or payable to date, but less any sums due to or on

Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, L.P. (the <B>&#147;<U>Correspondent</U>&#148;</B>) to originate

retained solely as an independent contractor and will not be considered or construed under any

authority to accept or execute this Agreement on behalf of Lender and that all representations,
documents and understandings between Applicant and Correspondent with respect to Applicant&#146;s offer
for Borrower to borrow are merged into this Agreement. Separate and apart from this Agreement,
Applicant and Correspondent have entered into an agreement that provides for Applicant to pay to
Correspondent a brokerage fee or commission in connection with the Loan and, notwithstanding the
merger provision contained in the preceding sentence, such agreement is not merged into this
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicant further acknowledges and agrees that Lender may have a separate compensation
arrangement with Correspondent pursuant to which payments may be made by Lender to Correspondent or
other compensation earned by Correspondent based on various factors. Such factors may, among other
things, include the volume of new loan originations done by Correspondent with Lender (which may
include the Loan or other loans made by Lender to other borrowers), the amount of loans serviced by
Correspondent for Lender (which may include servicing of the Loan as well as other loans made
by Lender to other borrowers), the scope of services and duties performed as part of the servicing
performed by Correspondent over the Term, or the existence of a sub-servicing arrangement in
connection with the Loan. Such compensation paid by Lender to Correspondent will be in addition to
any fees paid to Correspondent by Applicant or Borrower.
