    Mr. James Dore
    PXRE Corporation
    399 Thornall Street, Fourteenth Floor
    Edison, New Jersey 08837

    Dear Jim:

    Re:  SVO Filings

    This letter serves as follow up to the SVO Filings agreement originally
    presented to Mr. Kimmel in June 1999 for final signature. The text of the
    letter has not been changed.

    In addition to the investment management and advisory services provided by
    Phoenix Investment Counsel, Inc. ("PIC") pursuant to certain amended
    Investment Advisory Agreements ("Agreements") between PIC and PXRE
    Corporation; Transnational Insurance Company and PXRE Reinsurance Company
    (together "PXRE"); PIC will prepare all required new filings and updates
    ("Filings") with the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association
    of Insurance Commissioners ("SVO") for those securities heretofore purchased
    and to be purchased in the future by PIC for such accounts and portfolios
    managed by PIC under the Agreements for the duration of such Agreements.

    PIC shall have no duty, obligation or responsibility to prepare Filings for
    securities owned by PXRE but managed by someone other than PIC or for
    securities held in an account or portfolio but not purchased for the
    portfolio by PIC. However, at your request, PIC agrees to prepare SVO
    Filings for securities not purchased by PIC, provided that PIC receives any
    and all information necessary to prepare such Filings from Phoenix Home Life
    Mutual Insurance Company's (PHL) Investment Accounting department. If, after
    reasonable attempts to obtain such information from PHL or PXRE, PIC does
    not receive all of the information it deems necessary in its sole discretion
    to prepare such Filings, PIC shall have no obligation or duty to prepare the
    Filings so requested.

    Upon your request, PIC further agrees to provide training support to
    designated PXRE staff for a period of one year from the date of this letter
    agreement or for such longer period as agreed to in writing by PIC and PXRE.

    PXRE specifically acknowledges and agrees that neither PIC or any of PIC's
    officers, directors, employees or agents shall be liable hereunder for any
    action taken or not taken in providing the services hereunder and PXRE
    agrees to pay for or reimburse PIC for any and all out-of-pocket expenses
    incurred in the performance of the services hereunder including but not
    limited to, filing fees. PIC estimates Filing fees and out-of-pocket
    expenses to be $300 per security at this time and agrees to charge PXRE no
    more than $300 per security Filing made by PIC under the terms of this
    Agreement for the period ending 6/30/00. This letter agreement may be
    terminated by either PIC or PXRE at any time and for any reason by written
    notice to the other.

The terms and conditions set forth herein constitute the entire agreement
between PIC and PXRE and supercede all prior oral and written statements of any
kind whatsoever made by either party or their representatives. This letter
agreement may only be modified in writing and shall be construed under the laws
of the State of Connecticut.

If you are in agreement with the foregoing terms, please sign the enclosed copy
of this letter in the space provided and return to me.

                                       PHOENIX INVESTMENT COUNSEL, INC.
