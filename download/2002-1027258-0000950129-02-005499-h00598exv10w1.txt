     acknowledge will not be actually expended by Seller prior to Closing), to
     the extent actually paid or expended by Seller prior to Closing in respect
     of the A&M Lease (as below defined), but in no event will such
     reimbursement exceed the amount of $910,000. For purposes hereof, the "FPPC
     LEASING COSTS" means the Seller-certified and reasonably documented cost of
     tenant improvements, the other improvements and fees and brokerage
     commissions paid or incurred by Seller as landlord under the FPPC Lease (as
     below defined), to the extent actually paid or expended by Seller prior to

     SECTION 3. EARNEST MONEY. Upon execution by both parties, Purchaser shall
deliver to Charter Title Company, 4265 San Felipe, Suite 350, Houston, Texas
77027 (Attn: Mr. Jim Johnson, Escrow Officer) (the "TITLE COMPANY"), a check in
the amount of One Hundred Thousand and No/100 Dollars ($100,000.00), which the
Title Company shall immediately deposit for collection. As used in this
Agreement, the term "EARNEST MONEY" shall mean the amount so deposited by
Purchaser, together with all interest earned thereon while in the custody of
Title Company. Title Company shall immediately deposit the Earnest Money in an

Westheimer, Suite 301, Houston, Texas 77057, Attention: Tom Lykos, will split
equally the title insurance premiums and other fees from the Owner's Policy
(including the leasehold title policy portion even if issued as a separate
policy), and the Title Company will allow Chicago Title Company to perform such
services in connection with this Closing as are necessary for Chicago Title
Company to earn such split premium. Seller and Purchaser stipulate that
Purchaser's agreement to so deposit the Earnest Money is sufficient
consideration to support this Agreement notwithstanding Purchaser's rights under
Section 5 hereof; however, if Purchaser does not timely deposit the Earnest
Money, then this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force or effect.

     SECTION 3.A INDEPENDENT CONTRACT CONSIDERATION. The sum of $100.00 of the
Earnest Money shall be held by the Title Company and delivered to Seller either

          (a) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, has previously delivered or
     caused to be delivered to Purchaser the following:

               (1) Commitment for Title Insurance ("TITLE COMMITMENT") from the
          Title Company setting forth the status of the title of the Office
          Building Property, the Improvements, and the ground lessee's interest
          under the Ground Lease in and to the Ground Lease Property, showing
          all liens, claims, encumbrances, easements, rights-of-way,
          encroachments, reservations, restrictions and all other matters of
          record affecting such Real Property based on the Title Company's title
          examination of each such tract and/or interest in Real Property; and

               (2) A true, complete and legible copy of all documents referred
          to in the Title Commitment ("TITLE COMMITMENT DOCUMENTS").

     The Title Company is directed to deliver a copy of the Title Commitment and
     Title Documents to Seller, Purchaser and their counsel (as per the notice
     provisions hereof) simultaneously.

          (b) Within three (3) business days after the Effective Date, Seller,
     at its sole cost and expense, shall deliver to Purchaser a current survey
     ("SURVEY") of the Land consisting of a plat and field notes prepared by a
     licensed surveyor acceptable to Purchaser and Title Company, which Survey
     shall state that it meets the conditions and requirements of a Category 1A,
     Condition II Survey per the Surveying Standards and Specifications of the
     Texas Society of Professional Surveyors and, at Purchaser's option as it
     may elect (i) reflect the actual dimensions of, and area within, the Land,
     the location of any easements, setback lines, encroachments or overlaps
     thereon or thereover, and the outside boundary lines of all Improvements
     and the Ground Lease Improvements (ii) identify by recording reference all
     easements, set back lines and other matters referred to in the Title
     Commitment, (iii) include the surveyor's registered number and seal, the
     date of the Survey and a certificate satisfactory to Purchaser, (iv)
     reflect that there is access to and from the Land from a publicly dedicated
     street or road, (v) be sufficient to cause the Title Company to delete
     (except for "shortages in area") the printed exception for "discrepancies,
     conflicts or shortages in area or boundary lines, or encroachments, or any
     overlapping of improvements" in the Owner's Title Policy to be delivered
     pursuant to Section 8 hereof, (vi) reflect any area within the Land that
     has been designated by the Federal Insurance Administration, the Army Corps
     of Engineers, or any other governmental agency or body as being subject to
     special or increased flooding hazards, and (vii) contain such other
     information as Purchaser may elect. At least two copies of the Survey will
     be delivered to each Seller, Purchaser and their counsel promptly upon its
     receipt by Seller. For purposes of the property description to be included
     in the special warranty deed to be delivered pursuant to Section 8 hereof,
     the field notes prepared by the surveyor shall control any conflicts or
     inconsistencies with EXHIBIT "A" hereto, and


                                       4
<PAGE>


     such field notes shall be incorporated herein by this reference upon their
     completion and approval by Purchaser provided that there is no material
     discrepancy between the description contained in the Survey prepared by
     Purchaser and the description initially provided on EXHIBIT "A" hereto,
     but if any land is contained in the description of the Office Building
     Property prepared by Purchaser's surveyor that is not contained in the
     description on EXHIBIT "A" hereto then Seller shall quitclaim to Purchaser
     all right, title and interest of Seller, if any, in and to such additional
     lands. The Ground Lease Assignment will not contain a legal description of
     the Ground Lease Property, but rather will refer to the Ground Lease
     Property solely by reference to the description contained in original
     recorded instrument in the Harris County Real Property Records evidencing
     the existence of the Ground Lease.

          (c)   Seller, at its sole cost and expense, has heretofore delivered
     to Purchaser current searches of all Uniform Commercial Code financing
     statements filed with the Office of the Secretary of State of Texas and
     the County Clerk of Harris County, Texas, against Seller reflecting all
     effective financing statements then of record relating to the Property or
     any part thereof.

          (d)  Prior to the date hereof, Seller represents that it has, at its
     sole cost and expense, delivered to Purchaser (i) Copies of the Ground
     Lease relating to the Ground Lease Property (except documents of record,
     which will be part of the Title Commitment Documents); (ii) Copies of all
     existing Leases, including all amendments, letter agreements, and
     guaranties, if any, relating thereto; (iii) Operating Statements for the
     Building for the past two years, including copies of ad valorem tax
     statements for the past two years, and any notice or correspondence
     actually received by Seller relating to assessed valuation for the year
     2002; (iv) Copies of all Property Agreements; (v) Copies of all third-party
     prepared engineering and environmental inspections, soil reports,
     maintenance inspections and equipment reports prepared for Seller in
     relation to the Building and its operation; (vi) To the extent in Seller's
     possession or reasonably under its control, as-built plans and
     specifications of the Real Property; (vii) Brief summary of any and all
     pending lawsuits related to the Real Property if involving Seller as a
     party; (viii) To the extent in Seller's possession or reasonably under its
     control, copies of any current certificates of occupancy (or compliance)
     that have been issued for the Real Property; and (ix) To the extent
     actually received by Seller, copies of notices regarding condemnation,
     noncompliance with laws or regulations, and insurance cancellations, if
     any, relating to the Property. The documents described in this Section 4(d)
     are herein collectively called the "DOCUMENTS," and the information
     contained in the Documents is herein collectively called the "INFORMATION."
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary or apparent contrary herein, no
     Documents or Information shall ever be required to include attorney-client
     privileged communications. Purchaser agrees that it will not in any manner
     rely on any of the Operating Statements or other financial history of the
     Property as provided by Seller hereunder, which shall be deemed of
     non-material effect for all purposes, and will instead, at Purchaser's own
     risk, rely only on its own evaluation of expected operating expense and
     income and/or on the opinion and/or projections of experts hired by
     Purchaser to evaluate the same (if Purchaser feels it cannot make such
     forecasts or projections with reasonable accuracy on its own).

     SECTION 5.  RIGHT OF INSPECTION; CONTINGENCY PERIOD.

          (a)  From the Effective Date until Closing, Purchaser shall have the
     right and option to enter upon the Real Property (except Purchaser may not
     enter any third-party Tenant space except as may be permitted pursuant to
     such Tenant's Lease and then only upon prior arrangement through Seller)
     and to conduct any and all further inspections, studies and tests,
     including, but not limited to, engineering studies, soil tests and analyses
     (geotechnical studies only, not environmental core sampling or ground water
     drilling or sampling except as approved by Seller as provided below),
     utilities analyses and surveys, service contracts, plans and specifications
     and physical inspections of, on and with respect to the Property
     (collectively, the "TESTS AND INSPECTIONS") as Purchaser, in Purchaser's
     sole discretion, determines to be necessary or appropriate; provided,
     however, that such Tests and Inspections do not interfere in any material
     respect with any work being performed by Lessor or Lessor's contractors or
     subcontractors in or about the Property or with the operation of the
     Property or with any Tenant rights, nor shall any Test or Inspection result
     in material damage, injury or defacement of any part of the Property, and
     the Tests and Inspections shall be at Purchaser's sole cost and expense. It
     is expressly understood and agreed that any so-called "phase two"
     environmental testing of the Real Property (other than non-destructive
     sampling of materials suspected of being asbestos-containing), including,
     without limitation, soil and water table sampling and installation of
     ground water monitoring or sampling wells, shall be considered destructive
     and shall require special written permission of Seller in each instance.
     Seller hereby agrees to reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and to provide
     Purchaser with such information and documentation in Seller's actual
     possession as Purchaser reasonably requests in order to assist Purchaser in
     making the Tests and Inspections. Purchaser's entry onto the Property to
     conduct such Tests and Inspections shall be at Purchaser's sole risk,
     subject to the rights of persons in possession of the Property. Except as
     otherwise provided in the next sentence, Purchaser shall and hereby agrees
     to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller, its agents, employees,
     lenders and affiliates, from and against any and all, claims, liabilities,
     actions, suits, proceedings, judgments, damages, losses, injury, costs,
     fees and expenses, including, without limitation, costs of court and
     attorney's fees, arising in any way out of or in connection with any
     activities of Purchaser (or its agents and representatives) upon the
     Property in connection with inspecting, studying and/or investigating the
     Property, and Purchaser shall immediately restore any portion of the
     Property disturbed by any such Tests or Inspections to the condition
     existing immediately prior to such Test or Inspection procedure.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Purchaser be liable under
     the preceding sentence for claims, liabilities, actions, suits,
     proceedings, judgments, damages, losses, injury, costs, fees and expenses,
     including, without limitation, costs of court and attorneys' fees, arising
     from or in connection with the pre-existing conditions even if the Tests or
     Inspections aggravated or activated same, unless resulting from the gross
     negligence or willful or wanton neglect of Purchaser or its contractors or
     consultants. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary or apparent contrary
     elsewhere in this Agreement, the indemnity, defense and repair obligations
     of Purchaser under the Section shall survive for six (6) months the
     expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason. Nothing in this
     Section 5(a) shall be deemed to give Purchaser any right to terminate this
     Agreement that is not expressly stated in Section 5(b) hereof.



                                       6
<PAGE>
          (b) If for any reason Purchaser, in its sole and absolute discretion,
     is not satisfied with the physical condition of the Improvements, or any
     matter in the Documents, or any part of the Information or is otherwise not
     satisfied with the Property, or is not allowed to undertake the Tests and
     Inspections desired, then Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
     Agreement in accordance with Section 12(b) hereof, by delivering to Seller
     a notice of termination at any time during the period from the Effective
     Date hereof until the end of the day one business day immediately preceding
     the Closing Date ("CONTINGENCY PERIOD").

     SECTION 6. TITLE. Purchaser shall have the right, at any time by the end of
the second business day prior to expiration of the Contingency Period, to object
in writing to any liens and encumbrances reflected by the Title Commitment or
Survey. All liens and encumbrances to which Purchaser so objects are hereinafter
referred to as the "NON-PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES", if no such notice of objection
is given by Purchaser during such time, then it shall be deemed that all matters
reflected by the Survey and Title Commitment are "PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES."
Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, at its sole cost, to cure
or remove all Non-Permitted Encumbrances and give Purchaser written notice
thereof before the end of the Contingency Period (if Seller fails to give such
notice to Purchaser by the day prior to the end of the Contingency Period,
Seller shall be deemed to have notified Purchaser that it will not cure any such
items except those hereinbelow described as being items that Seller must remove
at or by Closing); provided, however, that Seller at its sole cost shall be
obligated to cure or remove at or before Closing the following ("MANDATORY CURE
ITEMS"): (A) all mortgages, deeds of trust, or other voluntary liens securing
financial obligations that have been created, or knowingly assumed, by Seller or
anyone acting on behalf of Seller and (B) materialmen's liens or lien claims
("M&M LIEN CLAIMS") to the extent such M&M Lien Claims do not, in the aggregate
exceed $250,000, whether or not Purchaser objects thereto during the period
provided above for Purchaser making objections. If Seller does not timely cause
all of the Non-Permitted Encumbrances to be removed or cured, and timely written
notice thereof to be given to Purchaser, then Purchaser, as its sole and
exclusive remedy (other than its right to require removal of Mandatory Cure
Items on or prior to Closing and hold Seller in default by reason of its failure
to do so), shall have the right either (i) to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with the Section 12(b) hereof by delivering notice to Seller before
the end of the Contingency Period, or (ii) to elect to purchase the Property
subject to the Non-Permitted Encumbrances without reduction of the Purchase
Price, in which event all such uncured Non-Permitted Encumbrances (other than
Mandatory Cure Items) shall become Permitted Encumbrances for purposes hereof.

     SECTION 7. SELLER'S EXCLUSIVE (LIMITED) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES;
OPERATING COVENANTS OF SELLER; TENANT ESTOPPELS AND GROUND LEASE ESTOPPEL.

          (a) EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS (LIMITED) WARRANTIES OF SELLER CONTAINED

          transactions provided for herein without obtaining any further

          under the Ground Lease Property, free and clear of all liens (except
          the Permitted Encumbrances), and no party, except as herein set forth,
          has or shall have on the Closing Date any rights in, or to acquire,
          the Office Building Property, the Improvements or the Ground Lease.


               (iii)  To Seller's actual knowledge only, a certificate of
          occupancy has been duly issued with regard to the Improvements.

          ROLL" that has been prepared by Seller's third-party management agent
          for the Property, which Seller has no actual knowledge is incorrect in
          any material respect. Except as provided below in this subparagraph
          and except for the SWBOT Lease: (1) to Seller's actual knowledge, the

          constitute the only agreements between Seller and such Tenants.
          Qualifications to the foregoing are as follows: any contrary matter

          attached hereto as EXHIBIT "C-1" (the "A/R LISTING") is true and
          correct in all material respects as of the date indicated thereon;
          provided, however, that Seller does not guarantee that no Tenant will
          debate or request to audit to determine whether particular sums are
          in fact correctly calculated or due under such Tenant's Lease;

               (vii)  To Seller's actual knowledge at the time of their
          delivery, the Documents delivered by Seller to Purchaser hereunder
          will be complete copies of all Documents required to be delivered by

               (viii)  There are no actions, suits, claims, assessments, or
          proceedings pending to Seller's actual knowledge only, or overtly
          threatened against Seller or the Property that could materially
          adversely affect the ownership, operation, or maintenance of the
          Property or Seller's ability to perform hereunder.

               (ix)  Attached hereto as EXHIBIT "E" is a complete and correct
          list of all Property Agreements.

               (x)  To Seller's actual knowledge only, the Real Property has
          not been the site of any activity that would violate any past or
          present environmental law or regulation of any governmental body or
          agency having jurisdiction over the Real Property, and specifically,
          but without limitation, to Seller's actual knowledge only (1) solid
          waste, petroleum, or petroleum products have not been leaked or
          spilled onto the Real Property or contaminated the Real Property,
          and (2) no "hazardous materials" or "toxic substances" in the
          Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
          of 1980; the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act; and the
          Resources Conversation and Recovery Act, all as amended, have been
          leaked or spilled onto the Real Property or contaminated the Real
          Property.

               (xi)  Other than with respect to work performed under the TI
          Construction Contracts (i) Seller has no actual knowledge of any
          third party having filed or threatened to file a lien or lien claim

          Seller has not contracted for any material quantity of construction
          work on the Property that could give rise to a mechanic's or
          materialman's lien claim except work completed and paid for by Seller
          in full prior to January 31, 2002.

     For purposes hereof, "SELLER'S ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE" shall mean and include
     only the actual personal knowledge of David A. Thomas or Robert B. Neely,
     without inquiry or investigation of any kind other than that (if any)
     heretofore done by Seller to the extent the same is within in the actual
     personal knowledge either of the two individuals named above, and expressly
     excludes implied, imputed or constructive knowledge of Seller or such
     individuals.

     If (i) any of Seller's representations and warranties set forth in this
     Section 7 are untrue in any material respect, or (ii) at any time at or
     before Closing there is any material change with respect to the matters
     represented and warranted by Seller pursuant to this Section 7 and such
     information becomes part of Seller's actual knowledge as defined herein,
     then Seller shall give Purchaser prompt written notice thereof, and
     Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
     with Section 12(b) hereof by delivering notice to Seller at any time at or
     before the Closing. All of Seller's express representations and warranties
     herein (as re-given by Seller at Closing as modified to accommodate changes
     in Seller's actual knowledge between the Effective Date and Closing) shall
     survive the Closing for a period of one (1) year (such that any claim of
     Purchaser for misrepresentation or breach of warranty by Seller that is not
     discovered and brought to Seller's attention in writing within that
     one-year period shall be deemed not to have survived Closing), except that
     the representation and warranty in Section  7(b)(ii) will not survive
     Closing and will be deemed merged out of existence by delivery of the Deed
     and other Closing documents hereunder.


          (c)  From the Effective Date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller
     shall: (i) maintain and operate the Property in a good and businesslike
     manner in accordance with good and prudent business practices, but shall
     not be obligated to make any specific repairs unless it determines the same
     to be necessary for its own liability purposes; (ii) use good faith efforts
     to continue all Leases, Property Agreements, and insurance policies
     relative to the Property in full force and effect, and neither cancel,
     amend, nor renew any of the same without Purchaser's prior written consent,
     which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that
     Seller may, if it so elects, without Purchaser's consent (A) cancel, amend
     or renew any Property Agreement in the ordinary course of Seller's
     business, provided that Seller shall give Purchaser prompt notice and a
     copy of any document or letter accomplishing the same, and further provided
     that such renewal of a Property Agreement allows Seller (and its successor)
     to terminate without cost or expense upon no more than 30 days notice, (B)
     cancel, amend or renew any Lease in the ordinary course of Seller's
     business (including by reason of any Tenant default), up to ten (10) days
     prior to Closing, or up to Closing honor any tenant's exercise of any
     renewal/right of refusal or expansion option contained in any Lease (but if
     the rental rate for the renewal/right of refusal or expansion is subject to
     determination in Seller's sole and absolute discretion, Seller shall not
     agree to such renewal or expansion rate after the tenth (10th day prior to
     Closing), provided that in each of the foregoing cases Seller shall give
     Purchaser prompt notice and a copy of any document or letter accomplishing
     the



                                       11
<PAGE>

     same and upon receipt thereof Purchaser may cancel this Contact by written
     notice to Seller if the terms of such cancellation, renewal or expansion
     are not acceptable to Purchaser, and/or (C) renew or reasonably modify any
     insurance policy in the ordinary course of Seller's business; (iii) not
     destroy, remove or materially alter any of the Improvements, except tenant
     finish improvements inside Tenant space per the terms of any Lease; (iv)
     except as permitted by clause (ii) hereof or otherwise in the ordinary
     course of Seller's business and not creating any material interference with
     use and operation of the Property for its present use and operation, not,
     without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which shall not be
     unreasonably withheld), enter into any agreement or instrument or take any
     action that would encumber the Property after Closing, that would bind
     Purchaser or the Property after Closing, or that would be outside the
     normal scope of maintaining and operating the Property; and (v) not remove
     any item of the Personalty from the Land or Improvements unless it is
     replaced with an item of reasonably equal value that is properly suited for
     its intended purpose (in which event the inventory of Personalty will be
     amended accordingly). If Seller desires to obtain the consent to any matter
     for which Purchaser's consent is required or desired by Seller hereunder,
     Seller may request such consent in writing, accompanied by the appropriate
     proposed document, or a description of the proposed action, and if
     Purchaser fails to object thereto within five (5) business days of receipt
     of Seller's request, specifying the reasonable basis for Purchaser's
     disapproval, Purchaser shall be conclusively deemed to have approved of
     such document or action as described in Seller's notice. Notwithstanding
     the foregoing, however, Seller shall further be entitled to execute a
     construction contract for the construction of tenant improvements as
     required and/or contemplated under the A&M Lease (the "A&M CONSTRUCTION
     CONTRACT"), and a construction contact for the construction of tenant
     improvements as required and/or contemplated under the FPPC Lease (the
     "FPPC CONSTRUCTION CONTACT''), each in such form as Purchaser determines to
     be appropriate (though Purchaser will have a right to terminate this
     Agreement if it does not approve of the terms of such contracts), such
     construction contracts being herein collectively referred to as the "TI
     CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS."

          (d)     Seller represents that prior to the date hereof, Seller has
     sent to each Tenant (except Purchaser), by regular mail or delivery, a
     Tenant Estoppel Certificate substantially in the form of EXHIBIT "H"
     attached hereto, requesting that such certificate be promptly executed and
     returned to Seller, and to the Ground Lease lessor, by regular mail or hand
     delivery, a Ground Lessor Estoppel Certificate substantially in the form of
     EXHIBIT "J" attached hereto, requesting that such certificate be promptly
     executed and returned to Seller. Within two (2) business days after the
     Effective Date and receipt from Purchaser of its requested estoppel form,
     as to the FPPC Construction Contract, and within two (2) business days
     after Seller's execution of the A&M Construction Contract as to that
     contact, Seller shall send to the contractor under the respective TI
     Construction Contracts TI Construction Contract Estoppel in the form
     reasonably requested by Purchaser, requesting that such certificate be
     promptly executed by the contractor and returned to Seller; provided,
     however, if any charge or reimbursement of legal fees of counsel is
     requested by the Ground Lease lessor as a condition to its consideration of
     such estoppel, Purchaser agrees to advance any funds required thereby and
     if any such costs are unpaid as of Closing Seller may require reimbursement
     by Purchaser at Closing




                                       12

     as a condition to Closing. Seller shall use good faith efforts (without
     litigation, exercise of lease termination remedies or legal demand) to seek
     to have all such Tenant Estoppel Certificates and the Ground Lease Estoppel
     Certificate executed and delivered to Seller prior to Closing, but nothing
     contained constitutes any guarantee or promise by Seller that such
     certificates shall be executed or delivered as of the date of Closing.
     However, Purchaser may, at its option, terminate this Agreement if any such
     estoppels (including TI Construction Contract Estoppels) are not received
     by the Closing Date.

     SECTION 8. CLOSING. The closing ("CLOSING") of the sale of the Property by
Seller to Purchaser shall occur on or before May 31, 2002 ("CLOSING DATE"). Time
is of the essence with regard to the Closing Date. The Closing shall occur in

the Closing the following, which are mutually concurrent Closing conditions,

          hereof, adjusted in accordance with Section 8(c) hereof and in the

          after the Closing, Purchaser will have succeeded to all of the rights,
          titles, and interests of Seller related to the Property and Seller
          will no longer have any rights, titles, or interests in and to the
          Property, but under no circumstance requiring Purchaser to undertake
          any representation, warranty, covenant or liability not expressly
          contemplated by the terms and provisions of this Agreement, nor that
          would result in any cost to such party not expressly contemplated by
          the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

          (b)  Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall deliver or cause to

     construction of tenant improvements pursuant to the A&M Lease, the FPPC
     Lease or any other lease, unless previously spent by Landlord (with
     appropriate documentation) for the costs for which they were deposited with
     Seller) will be transferred to Purchaser without any credit to Seller. If
     the actual amounts to be prorated are not known as of the Closing Date, the
     prorations shall be made on the basis of the best evidence then available,
     and thereafter, when actual figures are received, a cash settlement will be
     made between Seller and Purchaser. With regard to proration of rent
     escalations under Leases, it is agreed that such proration will be made
     based upon Seller's current budget or projection of building operating
     expenses for the year of Closing absent clear bad faith on the part of
     Seller in regard to such estimates and absent such bad faith the respective
     shares of rent escalation payments to be received by Seller and Purchaser
     shall instead be reconciled within ninety (90) days after the close of the
     year during which Closing occurs, based on actual building operating
     expenses incurred by Seller and Purchaser, collectively, for the year of
     Closing based on calculations thereof as permitted by the Leases, it being
     assumed and deemed that Seller and Purchaser bore such building operating
     expenses (regardless of proof to the contrary) after taking into account
     other Closing adjustments and prorations of expenses in proportion to their
     respective periods of ownership during the calendar year during which
     Closing occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, a sum of money
     agreed to by the parties (if the parties cannot agree then Purchaser's sole
     remedy will be to close without such escrow or terminate with the same
     effect as if Purchaser had terminated during the Study Period) will be
     deposited by Seller in escrow with the Title Company at Closing, under an
     escrow agreement joined in by and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and
     the Title Company (the ''ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT ESCROW AGREEMENT''), to
     provide a pool of funds from which final adjustments and reconciliations of
     escalation payments can be made after Closing as herein contemplated. All
     Deposits shall be credited against the cash portion of the Purchase Price
     in lieu of assigning such Deposits to Purchaser. No prorations shall be
     made in relation to delinquent rents existing as of the Closing Date;
     rather, Section 10 hereof shall govern Seller's rights to such rents. The
     provisions of this Section 8(c) shall survive the Closing.

          (d)  Seller shall pay all costs and liabilities relating to the
     Property that arise out of or are attributable to the period prior to the
     Closing Date, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from such
     costs and liabilities and from all reasonable attorneys' fees expended by
     Purchaser in connection therewith. Subject to Section 10 hereof, Seller
     shall have the right to receive all proceeds relating to the Property that
     are properly allocable to the period before the Closing Date, and Purchaser
     shall have the right to receive all proceeds relating to the Property that
     are properly allocable to the period from and after the Closing Date.
     Purchaser shall pay all costs and liabilities relating to the Property that
     arise out of or are attributable to the period from and after the Closing
     Date, except such costs and liabilities that arise out of or result from a
     breach by Seller of its representations and warranties set forth in Section
     7 hereof, and Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller from such
     costs and liabilities and from all reasonable attorney's fees expended by
     Seller in connection therewith. This Section 8(d) shall survive the
     Closing.

          (e)  Title Company shall return the Earnest Money to Purchaser or
     Seller shall have the Title Company credit the Earnest Money to the
     Purchase Price.


                                       16

          (f)  Upon completion of the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser
     possession of the Property free and clear of all tenancies of every kind
     and parties in possession, except for the Tenants under the Leases, with
     all parts of the Property (including without limitation the Leases,
     Improvements and Personalty) in the same condition as on the Effective
     Date, normal wear only excepted.

     SECTION 9.  COMMISSIONS; REAL ESTATE BROKER NOTICE. Seller has agreed to
pay, at but only in the event of consummation of the Closing and out of the
proceeds of the sale, to LoneStar Alliance, a sales commission in the amount of
0.825% of the gross Purchase Price, and to Transwestern Commercial Services in
the amount of 0.675% of the gross Purchase Price, both such brokers representing
Purchaser in this transaction (collectively, "BROKERS"). If the Closing under
this Agreement does not occur for any reason, including default by either party,
then Seller shall not be obligated to pay any commission to Brokers by reason of
this Agreement or the proposed transaction contemplated hereby. Brokers have
executed this Agreement for the sole and limited purpose of acknowledging and
accepting the terms of this Section 9 as representing the sole and complete
agreement between Seller and such Brokers with regard to the payment of
commissions to them in connection with this transaction, and their joinder shall
not be required for any amendment to this Agreement that does not amend the
content of this Section 9. Except as set forth in this Section 9, Seller shall
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Purchaser, from and against all claims by
third parties for brokerage, commission, finders, or other fees relative to this
Agreement or the sale of the Property, and all court costs, attorneys' fees, and
other costs or expenses arising therefrom, and alleged to be due by reason of an
agreement of Seller. Purchaser will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller
from and against payment of or claims and litigation for any real estate
commission claimed to be payable to agents or consulting agents representing
Purchaser, other than Brokers. As provided for in the Texas Real Estate License
Act, Purchaser is advised to have an abstract of title with regard to the Real
Property examined by an attorney of its choice, or to obtain a policy of title
insurance.

     SECTION 10.  DELINQUENT RENTS. Seller shall retain title to all delinquent
rents existing as of the Closing Date under the Leases, and to all delinquent
parking rents (collectively, the "DELINQUENT RENTS"), and shall have the right
to collect such Delinquent Rents at Seller's sole cost and expense; provided,
however, that in pursuance of such collection efforts, Seller shall not exercise
any of the Lessor's or Landlord's rights under any Lease. Purchaser agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with such collections, and to
promptly remit to Seller all such delinquent rents collected by Purchaser after
Closing; provided, however that all rents that (i) are received after the
Closing Date from such delinquent tenants and (ii) are not designated by such
tenants to be on account of their obligations for any period before Closing,
shall be applied first against the then-current portion of such tenant's rent
obligation and then (and only then) against the Delinquent Rent portion due to
Seller and Purchaser shall promptly deliver such Delinquent Rents to Seller upon
receipt by Purchaser. The provisions of this Section 10 shall survive the
Closing.

     SECTION 11.  DESTRUCTION, DAMAGE, OR TAKING BEFORE CLOSING. If, before
Closing, all or any part of the Improvements or Personalty are destroyed or
damaged, or become subject to condemnation or eminent domain proceedings, then
Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof. Purchaser shall have the right
to elect to proceed with the Closing (subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement) by delivering notice thereof to Seller within five (5) business days



                                       17

<PAGE>


of receipt of Seller's notice respecting the damage, destruction, or taking, but
Purchaser shall be entitled to all insurance proceeds or condemnation awards
payable as a result of such damage or taking and, to the extent the same may be
necessary or appropriate, Seller shall assign to Purchaser at Closing Seller's
rights to such proceeds or awards. If, within five (5) business days of receipt
of Seller's notice respecting the damage, destruction, or taking, Purchaser
notifies Seller of its election to terminate this Agreement, or if Purchaser
gives no notice within such period, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 12(b) hereof.

     SECTION 12.  TERMINATION AND REMEDIES.

          (a)  If Purchaser fails to consummate the purchase of the Property
     pursuant to this Agreement (for any reason other than termination hereof
     pursuant to a right granted to Purchaser in Sections 5, 6, 7, and 11
     hereof), then Seller, as its sole remedy, shall have the right to
     terminate this Agreement by notifying Purchaser thereof, in which event
     Title Company shall deliver the Earnest Money to Seller as liquidated
     damages, whereupon neither Purchaser nor Seller shall have any further
     rights or obligations hereunder (except those indemnity and repair
     obligations of Purchaser stated herein to survive termination of this
     Agreement [the "SURVIVING OBLIGATIONS"]).

          (b)  If Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 5, 6,
     7, or 11 hereof, then Title Company shall return the Earnest Money to
     Purchaser, whereupon neither party hereto shall have any further rights or
     obligations hereunder, except the Surviving Obligations.

          (c)  If Seller breaches this Agreement prior to Closing or fails to
     consummate the sale of the Property pursuant to this Agreement (for any
     reason other than Purchaser's failure to perform its obligations hereunder
     or termination hereof by Purchaser in accordance with Section 12(b)), then
     Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy is to either: (i) terminate this
     Agreement by giving written notice to Seller thereof, in which case Title
     Company shall return the Earnest Money to Purchaser and neither party
     hereto shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder (except the
     Surviving Obligations); or (ii) enforce specific performance of the
     obligations of Seller hereunder.

          (d)  Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree that they have
     included the provision for payment of liquidated damages in Section 12(a)
     because, in the event of a breach by Purchaser, the actual damages to be
     incurred by Seller can reasonably be expected to approximate the amount of
     liquidated damages called for herein and because the actual amount of such
     damages would be difficult if not impossible accurately to measure.

          (e)  Nothing in this Section shall be construed as preventing either
     party from obtaining injunctive relief from violation of this Agreement by
     the other party under circumstances in which injunctive relief would be
     available under applicable law.

     SECTION 13.  NOTICES.  All notices provided or permitted to be given under
this Agreement must be in writing and may be served by depositing same in the
United States mail,

     SECTION 14. ASSIGNS; BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding on the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
legal representatives, successors, and assigns. This Agreement is for the sole

consent of Seller, but any other assignment by Purchaser is hereby prohibited

     SECTION 15.  GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.

     SECTION 16.  ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement is the entire agreement

modification hereof or subsequent agreement relative to the subject matter
hereof shall be binding on either party unless reduced to writing and signed by
the party to be bound. EXHIBITS A, A-1, B, C, C-1, AND D THROUGH L, inclusive,
attached hereto, are incorporated herein by this reference for all purposes.

     SECTION 17.  ATTORNEY'S FEES. Should any litigation or administrative
proceeding be commenced by either of the parties hereto or their
representatives, or should either party institute any proceeding in a bankruptcy
or similar court which has jurisdiction over any other party hereto or any or
all of its property or assets, or should any litigation or proceeding be
commenced concerning any provision of this Agreement or the rights and duties of
any person or entity in relation thereto, then the party or parties prevailing
in such litigation or proceeding shall be entitled, in addition to such other
relief as may be granted, to a reasonable sum as and for such prevailing party's
attorneys' fees and court costs in such litigation or proceeding, which shall be
determined by the court (or presiding official) in such litigation or
proceeding or in a separate action brought for that purpose.

     SECTION 18.  SURVIVAL. The representations, warranties and covenants of
