</DIV>


<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT, dated as of February&nbsp;24, 2010, is by and between The
Chubb Corporation (the &#147;<U>Corporation</U>&#148;) and <U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</U> (the
&#147;<U>Participant</U>&#148;), pursuant to The Chubb Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan (2009) (the
&#147;<U>Plan</U>&#148;). Capitalized terms that are not defined herein shall have the same meanings given
to such terms in the Plan. If any provision of this Agreement conflicts with any provision of the
Plan (as either may be interpreted from time to time by the Committee), the Plan shall control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee has authorized the grant to the
Participant of Restricted Stock Units in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, subject to the acceptance of its terms by the Participant; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, the Participant and the Corporation desire to enter into this Agreement to evidence
and confirm the grant of such Restricted Stock Units on the terms and conditions set forth herein.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, the Participant and the Corporation agree as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Grant of Restricted Stock Units</U>. Pursuant to the provisions of the Plan, the Corporation on the date set forth above (the
&#147;<U>Grant Date</U>&#148;) has granted and hereby evidences the grant to the Participant, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan, of an award of &#95;&#95;&#95;Restricted Stock Units
(the &#147;<U>Award</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>Vesting and Rights as a Shareholder</U>. It is understood and agreed that the grant of the Award evidenced hereby is subject to the
following conditions:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Restrictions on Transfer</U>. Until settlement of the Restricted Stock Units in accordance with Section&nbsp;6, the Restricted
Stock Units may not be sold, assigned, hypothecated, pledged or otherwise transferred or encumbered
in any manner except (i)&nbsp;by will or the laws of descent and distribution or (ii)&nbsp;to a &#147;Permitted
Transferee&#148; (as defined in Section 11(c) of the Plan) with the permission of, and subject to such
conditions as may be imposed by, the Committee.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Restriction Period</U>. The Restriction Period applicable to the Restricted Stock Units covered by the Award shall
begin on the date hereof and, except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;3 or 4, shall, subject to the
Participant&#146;s continued employment from the Grant Date, lapse on the third anniversary of the Grant
Date (such date to be hereafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Vesting Date</U>&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>No Rights as a Shareholder</U>. Until shares of Stock are issued, if at all, in satisfaction of the Corporation&#146;s
obligations under this Award, in the time and manner provided in Section&nbsp;6, the Participant shall
have no rights as a shareholder.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Dividend Equivalents</U>. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until settlement of the Restricted Stock
Units in accordance with Section&nbsp;6, as soon as practicable after cash dividends are paid on the
Stock, the Participant shall be paid an amount in cash equal to the amount of dividends paid on
that number of shares of the Stock as is equal to the number of the Participant&#146;s Restricted Stock
Units. In any event, such payments shall be made by the March&nbsp;15th following the year in which the
actual dividends are paid on shares of Stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U>Termination of Employment</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Qualifying Termination</U>. If the Participant&#146;s employment terminates by reason of a Qualifying Termination during the
Restriction Period, the Restriction Period shall lapse as to (and there shall become vested and
non-forfeitable) that number of Restricted Stock Units equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the number of
Restricted Stock Units covered by the Award and (ii)&nbsp;a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of full calendar months during the Restriction Period that the Participant was employed and
the denominator of which is 36. The remainder of the Restricted Stock Units covered by the Award
shall be forfeited and canceled without further action by the Corporation or the Participant as of
the date of such termination.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Termination for any Other Reason</U>. If the Participant&#146;s employment terminates for any reason other than a Qualifying
Termination during the Restriction Period, all of the unvested Restricted Stock Units covered by
the Award shall be forfeited and canceled without further action by the Corporation or the
Participant as of the date of such termination. For purposes of the Award, the term &#147;Retirement&#148;
shall mean a termination of the Participant&#146;s employment other than for Cause at or after the
Participant&#146;s normal retirement age or earliest retirement date, in each case as specified in the
Pension Plan of The Chubb Corporation or its successor (the &#147;<U>Pension Plan</U>&#148;). Accordingly,
all of the unvested Restricted Stock Units covered by the Award shall be forfeited and canceled
without further action by the Corporation or the Participant as of the date a Participant is
terminated for Cause, whether prior to, on, or after the Participant&#146;s normal retirement age or
earliest retirement date, in each case as specified in the Pension Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Transfers between the Corporation and Subsidiaries; Leaves, Other Absences and
Suspension</U>. Transfer from the Corporation to a Subsidiary, from a Subsidiary to the Corporation, or
from one Subsidiary to another shall not be considered a termination of employment. Any question
regarding whether a Participant&#146;s employment has terminated in connection with a leave of absence
or other absence from active employment shall be determined by the Committee, in its sole
discretion, taking into account the provisions of applicable law and the Corporation&#146;s generally
applicable employment policies and practices. The Committee also may suspend the operation of the
termination of employment provisions of this Agreement for such period and upon such terms and
conditions as it may deem necessary or appropriate to further the interests of the Corporation.

the event of a Change in Control.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Adjustment in Capitalization</U>. In the event that the Committee shall determine that any stock dividend, stock split, share
combination, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation,
split-up, spin-off, combination, exchange of shares, warrants or rights offering to purchase Stock
at a price substantially below fair market value, or other similar corporate event affects the
Stock such that an adjustment is required in order to preserve, or to prevent the enlargement of,
the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Award, then the
Committee shall, in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable (in its sole discretion),
adjust any or all of the number and kind of units subject to this Award and/or, if deemed
appropriate, make provision for a cash payment to the person holding this Award; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that, unless the Committee determines otherwise, the number of Restricted Stock
Units subject to this Award always shall be a whole number.

Participant (or, if applicable, the Participant&#146;s Designated Beneficiary or legal representative)
that number of shares of Stock as is equal to the number of Restricted Stock Units covered by the
Award that have become vested and nonforfeitable within 90&nbsp;days after the earlier of (i)&nbsp;death,
(ii)&nbsp;Disability, (iii)&nbsp;Separation from Service, or (iv)&nbsp;the Vesting Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is (or is reasonably expected to be) a
<I>&#147;covered employee&#148; </I>within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code for the calendar year in which
delivery of Stock would ordinarily be made to the Participant, the Corporation shall delay delivery
to the Participant of that portion of the shares of Stock for which the Corporation reasonably
believes that Section 162(m) of the Code will preclude the Corporation from taking a compensation
expense deduction until the Participant&#146;s Separation from Service.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivery of shares upon a Separation from Service under this Section shall be subject to the
six month delay rule in Section 6(d) of the Plan, if applicable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with terms and conditions established by the Committee, the Participant may be
eligible to defer delivery of shares under the terms of the Corporation&#146;s Key Employee Deferred
Compensation Plan (2005)&nbsp;or its successor.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>Restrictive Covenants</U>. As a condition to the receipt of the Award made hereby, the Participant agrees to be bound

manner to the actual or anticipated business, research or development work of the Corporation or

provisions of this Section&nbsp;8 at any point before the Restricted Stock Units covered by the Award
are settled in accordance with Section&nbsp;6 of this Agreement shall cause such Restricted Stock Units
to be canceled and rescinded without any payment therefor. For the avoidance of doubt, following
a failure to comply with this Section&nbsp;8, all shares of Stock in respect of any portion of the
Restricted Stock Units covered by the Award for which delivery has been deferred under the Deferred
Compensation Plan in accordance with Section&nbsp;2 hereof shall be forfeited, and accordingly the
Participant shall have no further right to delivery or payment in respect of any such shares. In
the event that all or any portion of the Restricted Stock Units covered by this Award shall have
been settled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement within twelve (12)&nbsp;months of the date
on which any breach by the Participant of any of the provisions of this Section&nbsp;8 shall have first
occurred, the Committee may require that the Participant repay (with appreciation (if any),
determined up to the date repayment is made), and the Participant shall promptly repay, to the
Corporation the Fair Market Value of any Stock conveyed to the Participant within such period in
respect of such Restricted Stock Units. Additionally, the Participant agrees that the Corporation
shall be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief restraining
the Participant from committing any violation of the covenants or obligations contained in this
Section&nbsp;8. These rescission rights and injunctive remedies are cumulative and are in addition to
any other rights and remedies the Corporation may have at law or in equity. The Participant
acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations in this Section&nbsp;8 relate to special,
unique and extraordinary matters and that a violation or threatened violation of any of the terms
of such covenants or obligations will cause the Corporation and the Subsidiaries irreparable injury
for which adequate remedies are not available at law.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>Reformation</U>. The Participant agrees that the provisions of this Section&nbsp;8 are
necessary and reasonable to protect the Corporation in the conduct of its business. If any
restriction contained in this Section&nbsp;8 shall be deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by
reason of the extent, duration, or geographical scope hereof, or otherwise, then the court making
such determination shall have the right to reduce such extent, duration, geographical scope, or
other provisions hereof, and in its reduced form such restriction shall then be enforceable in the
manner contemplated hereby.

Corporation the amount of any taxes required by law to be withheld as may be necessary in the
opinion of the Corporation to satisfy tax withholding required under the laws of any country,
state, province, city, or other jurisdiction with respect to Stock deliverable hereunder or, in
lieu thereof, the Corporation shall have the right to retain (or the Participant may be offered the
opportunity to elect to tender) the number of shares of Stock whose Fair Market Value equals such
amount required to be withheld.

time prior to payment in any manner not inconsistent with the terms of the Plan. Any such action
by the Committee shall be subject to the Participant&#146;s consent if the Committee determines that
such action would have a materially adverse effect on the Participant&#146;s rights under such Award,
whether in whole or in part. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole discretion,
may amend an Award if it determines such amendment is necessary or advisable for the Corporation to
comply with applicable law (including Section&nbsp;409A of the Code), regulation, rule, or accounting
standard. As soon as is administratively practicable following the date of any such amendment to
this Agreement, the Corporation shall notify the Participant of the amendment; provided, however,
that failure to provide such notice shall not invalidate or otherwise impair the enforceability of
such amendment.
