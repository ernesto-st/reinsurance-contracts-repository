schedule and exhibit references are to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified.

          (d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to the singular and plural forms of such terms.

          1.3 Designated Senior Debt. The Loans and other obligations of the
Credit Parties hereunder and under the other Credit Documents shall constitute
"Designated Senior Debt," and this Agreement shall be deemed to be the "New
Credit Facility," for all purposes of the Existing Notes Indenture.

          1.4 Several Obligations; Power of Attorney. (a) Subject to the U.S.
Borrower's obligations under the Canadian Guarantee, the obligations of the
respective Borrowing Parties to pay the principal of and interest on each Loan
are several and not joint, and the Canadian Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall
not be liable for the payment obligations of the U.S. Borrower hereunder.

          (b) The Canadian Borrower hereby appoints the U.S. Borrower and each
of its officers to be its attorneys in fact (its "Attorneys") and in its name
and on its behalf and as its act and deed or otherwise to sign all documents and
carry out all such acts as are necessary or appropriate in connection with
executing any borrowing request, any Credit Documents or any other instruments,
certificates or documents delivered thereunder or in connection therewith

ratifies any and all acts which any of its Attorneys shall do in order to
execute on its behalf, or in connection with, the Documents mentioned herein.

          1.5 Exchange Rate Calculations. On each Calculation Date, the
Administrative Agent shall (a) determine (through consultation with the Canadian
Administrative Agent) the Canadian Exchange Rate as of such Calculation Date and
(b) give notice thereof to the U.S. Borrowers and to each Lender, in each case
if any such Person shall have requested such information. The Canadian Exchange
Rate so determined shall become effective on the first Business Day immediately
following the relevant Calculation Date (each, a "Reset Date") and shall remain
effective until the next succeeding Reset Date, and shall for all purposes of
this Agreement (other than any other provision expressly requiring the use of a
current Canadian Exchange Rate) be the Canadian Exchange Rate employed in
converting amounts between Dollars and Canadian Dollars.

the U.S. Borrower on the Closing Date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to
such Lender's

                                       33

<PAGE>

Closing Date Term Loan Commitment and (ii) each Term Loan Lender severally

Loan"; and collectively, the "Change of Control Term Loans"; together with the
Closing Date Term Loans, the "Term Loans") to the U.S. Borrower on the Change of
Control Payment Date, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of
(x) such Term Loan Lender's Change of Control Term Loan Commitment Percentage of
the Existing Notes Payment and (y) such Term Loan Lender's Change of Control
Term Loan Commitment. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, any undrawn portion of the Change of Control Term

of Control Term Loans shall be used to finance the Existing Notes Payment on the
Existing Notes Payment Date and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection

          SECTION 3. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS

          3.1 Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, (i) each U.S. Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to the
extent of its Available U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment to extend credit to the
U.S. Borrower from time to time on any Borrowing Date during the Revolving
Credit Commitment Period (A) by purchasing an L/C Participating Interest in each
Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender and (B) by making revolving loans
in Dollars ("U.S. Revolving Credit Loans") to the U.S. Borrower and (ii) each
Canadian Lender severally agrees to the extent of its Canadian Revolving Credit
Commitment if, at the time of the requested borrowing, the U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitments have been fully utilized, to extend credit to the U.S. Borrower from
time to time on any Borrowing Date during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period
by making revolving loans in Dollars to the U.S. Borrower through an Affiliate
of such Lender ("Canadian Revolving Credit Loans", and, collectively with the
U.S. Revolving Credit Loans, the "Revolving Credit Loans"). Notwithstanding the
above, in no event shall any Revolving Credit Loan be made, or Letter of Credit
be issued, if the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Loans to be made and
Letters of Credit to be issued would, after giving effect to the use of
proceeds, if any, thereof, exceed the aggregate Available Revolving Credit
Commitments nor shall any Letter of Credit be issued if after giving effect
thereto the sum of the undrawn amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and
the amount of all L/C Obligations would exceed $25,000,000.

          (b) During the Revolving Credit Commitment Period (subject to the
provisions of subsection 3.5(b) with respect to the expiry date of any Letter of
Credit),

                                       34

<PAGE>

the U.S. Borrower may use the Revolving Credit Commitments by borrowing,
prepaying the Revolving Credit Loans in whole or in part, and reborrowing, all
in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, and/or by having the Issuing
Lender issue Letters of Credit, having such Letters of Credit expire undrawn
upon or if drawn upon, reimbursing the Issuing Lender for such drawing, and
having the Issuing Lender issue new Letters of Credit.

          (c) Each borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to the Revolving
Credit Commitments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the lesser of
(i) $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof in the case of
Alternate Base Rate Loans, and $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and (ii) the Available Revolving
Credit Commitments, except that any borrowing of Revolving Credit Loans to be
used solely to pay a like amount of Swing Line Loans may be in the aggregate
principal amount of such Swing Line Loans.

          3.2 Commitment Fee. The U.S. Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each U.S. Revolving Credit Lender (other
than any Non-Funding Lender), and the Canadian Borrower agrees to pay to the
Canadian Administrative Agent for the account of each Canadian Lender (other
than any Non-Funding Lender), a commitment fee from and including the Closing
Date to and including the Revolving Credit Termination Date computed at the
Commitment Fee Rate on the average daily amount of the Available U.S. Revolving
Credit Commitment and the Available Canadian Revolving Credit Commitment, as
applicable, of such Lender during the period for which payment is made (whether
or not the Borrowing Parties shall have satisfied the applicable conditions to
borrow or for the issuance of a Letter of Credit set forth in Section 7). Such
commitment fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day
of each Fiscal Quarter of the U.S. Borrower and on the Revolving Credit
Termination Date, commencing on the first such date to occur following the
Closing Date.

          3.3 Proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans. The U.S. Borrower shall use
the proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans (a) to repay existing Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness in respect of revolving loans under the Existing Credit
Agreement on the Closing Date) and (b) for working capital and other general
corporate purposes.

          3.4 Swing Line Commitment. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swing Line Lender agrees, so long as the Administrative Agent has
not received notice that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to
make swing line loans (individually, a "Swing Line Loan"; collectively, the
"Swing Line Loans") to the U.S. Borrower from time to time during the Revolving
Credit Commitment Period in an aggregate principal amount at any one time
outstanding not to exceed $10,000,000; provided that no Swing Line Loan may be
made if the aggregate principal amount of the Swing Line Loans to be made would
exceed the aggregate Available Revolving Credit Commitments at such time.
Amounts borrowed by the U.S. Borrower under this subsection 3.4 may be repaid
and, through but excluding the Revolving Credit Termination Date, reborrowed.
All Swing Line Loans shall be made as Alternate Base

                                       35

<PAGE>

Rate Loans and shall not be entitled to be converted into Eurodollar Loans. The
U.S. Borrower shall give the Swing Line Lender irrevocable notice (which notice
must be received by the Swing Line Lender prior to 2:00 P.M., New York City
time) on the requested Borrowing Date specifying the amount of each requested
Swing Line Loan, which shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $250,000 or a
whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof and the wire transfer instructions
for the account of the U.S. Borrower to which the proceeds of such Swing Line
Loan should be transferred. The Swing Line Lender shall promptly make each Swing
Line Loan by wire transfer to the account specified by the U.S. Borrower in the
related notice of borrowing. The proceeds of Swing Line Loans may be used solely
for the purposes referred to in subsection 3.3.

          (b) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute
discretion may request, through the Administrative Agent, each U.S. Revolving
Credit Lender, including the Swing Line Lender, to make a U.S. Revolving Credit
Loan in an amount equal to such Lender's U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment
Percentage of the amount of the Swing Line Loans (the "Refunded Swing Line
Loans") outstanding on the date such notice is given (which shall be a Business
Day). Unless any of the events described in paragraph (f) of Section 10 shall
have occurred (in which event the procedures of paragraph (c) of this subsection
3.4 shall apply) each such Lender shall make the proceeds of its U.S. Revolving
Credit Loan available to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swing
Line Lender, at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in subsection
12.2 (or such other location as the Administrative Agent may direct) prior to
12:00 noon (New York City time) in funds immediately available on the Business
Day next succeeding the date such notice is given. The proceeds of such U.S.
Revolving Credit Loans shall be immediately applied to repay the Refunded Swing
Line Loans.

          (c) If prior to the making of a U.S. Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this subsection 3.4 one of the events described in paragraph
(f) of Section 10 shall have occurred, each U.S. Revolving Credit Lender will,
on the date such Loan was to have been made, purchase an undivided participating
interest in the Refunded Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to its U.S.
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such Refunded Swing Line Loan. Each
such Lender will promptly transfer to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the Swing Line Lender, in immediately available funds, the amount of its
participation and, upon its receipt thereof, the Swing Line Lender will deliver
to such Lender a Swing Line Loan Participation Certificate dated the date of
receipt of such funds and in such amount.

          (d) Whenever, at any time after the Administrative Agent has received,
for the account of the Swing Line Lender, from any U.S. Revolving Credit Lender
such Lender's participating interest in a Refunded Swing Line Loan, the
Administrative Agent receives any payment on account thereof, the Administrative
Agent will distribute to such Lender its participating interest in such amount
(appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period
of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding and
funded) in like funds as received; provided that in the event that such payment
received by the Administrative Agent is required to be returned, such Lender
will return to the Administrative Agent any portion

                                       36

<PAGE>

thereof previously distributed by the Administrative Agent to it in like funds
as such payment is required to be returned by the Administrative Agent.

          (e) The obligation of each U.S. Revolving Credit Lender to purchase
participating interests pursuant to subsection 3.4(c) shall be absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including, without
limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
which such Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, the U.S. Borrower or
any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance
of an Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or
otherwise) of the U.S. Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by the U.S.
Borrower or any other Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

          (f) In each case in which a Lender has made a Revolving Credit Loan
with respect to a Swing Line Loan pursuant to subsection 3.4(b) or has acquired
a participating interest in a Refunded Swing Line Loan pursuant to subsection
3.4(c), the Administrative Agent shall, on behalf of the U.S. Borrower, record,
in the applicable Register maintained pursuant to subsection 12.6(d), such
Lender's name, address, and amounts of entitlement to payments of principal and
interest with respect to such Revolving Credit Loan or participating interest.

          3.5 Issuance of Letters of Credit. (a) The U.S. Borrower may from time
to time request the Issuing Lender to issue a Standby L/C or a Commercial L/C by
delivering to the Issuing Lender at its address specified in subsection 12.2 (or
such other location as the Issuing Lender may direct) a letter of credit
application in the Issuing Lender's then customary form, with such changes
thereto as may be reasonably requested by the U.S. Borrower to conform such
application to the applicable provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents (the "L/C Application") completed to the satisfaction of the Issuing
Lender, together with the proposed form of such Letter of Credit (which shall
comply with the applicable requirements of paragraph (b) below) and such other
certificates, documents and other papers and information as the Issuing Lender
may reasonably request; provided that if the Issuing Lender informs the U.S.
Borrower that it is for any reason unable to open such Letter of Credit, the
U.S. Borrower may request any Lender to open such Letter of Credit upon the same
terms offered to the Issuing Lender and each reference to the Issuing Lender for
purposes of subsections 3.5 through 3.14, 7.1 and 7.2 shall be deemed to be a
reference to such Issuing Lender. In the event of any inconsistency between the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any L/C
Application or other document submitted by the U.S. Borrower to, or entered into
by the U.S. Borrower with, the Issuing Lender relating to any Letter of Credit,
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

          (b) Each Standby L/C and Commercial L/C issued hereunder shall be
issued for the account of the U.S. Borrower and shall, among other things, (i)
be denominated in Dollars and be in such form requested by the U.S. Borrower as
shall be acceptable to the Issuing Lender in its reasonable discretion and (ii)
have an expiry date occurring not later than (x) in the case of the Letters of
Credit issued on the Closing Date in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, as the
issuing lender under the Existing Credit

                                       37

<PAGE>

Agreement, the latest expiry date of the letters of credit outstanding under the
0Existing Credit Agreement on the Closing Date and (y) with regard to all other
Letters of Credit, 365 days after the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit
(or 366 days in the case of a Letter of Credit that will expire in a leap year)
and, in the case of Standby L/Cs, may be automatically renewed on its expiry
date for an additional period of up to 365 days, but in no case shall any Letter
of Credit have an expiry date occurring later than the fifth Business Day prior
to the Revolving Credit Termination Date. Each L/C Application and each Letter
of Credit shall be subject to the International Standby Practices (ISP 98) of
the International Chamber of Commerce or the Uniform Customs and, to the extent
not inconsistent therewith, the laws of the State of New York.

          3.6 Participating Interests. Effective in the case of each Standby L/C
and Commercial L/C (if applicable) as of the date of the opening thereof, the
Issuing Lender agrees to allot and does allot, to itself and each other U.S.
Revolving Credit Lender, and each such Lender severally and irrevocably agrees
to take and does take in such Letter of Credit and the related L/C Application
(if applicable), an L/C Participating Interest in a percentage equal to such
Lender's U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage. In each case in which an
Issuing Lender has allotted to another Lender an L/C Participating Interest,
such Issuing Lender shall maintain a register and record therein the amounts of
such other Lender's entitlement to payments of principal and interest with
respect to such L/C Participating Interest.

          3.7 Procedure for Opening Letters of Credit. The Issuing Lender will
promptly notify the Administrative Agent, who will promptly notify each U.S.
Revolving Credit Lender, of any L/C Application received by the Issuing Lender
from the U.S. Borrower and of the opening of any Letter of Credit in respect
thereof as provided below. Upon receipt of any L/C Application from the U.S.
Borrower, the Issuing Lender will process such L/C Application, and the other
certificates, documents and other papers delivered to the Issuing Lender in
connection therewith, in accordance with its customary procedures and, subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, shall promptly (and within three Business
Days after its receipt of such L/C Application and the other documents, papers
and information referred to above unless, in the circumstances, a longer period
is reasonably required) open such Letter of Credit by issuing the original of
such Letter of Credit to the beneficiary thereof and by furnishing a copy
thereof to the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent; provided that no
Letter of Credit shall be issued if the last sentence of subsection 3.1(a) would
be violated thereby (and, to confirm that this proviso would not be violated
thereby, the Issuing Lender will notify the Administrative Agent prior to
issuing any Letter of Credit).

          3.8 Payments in Respect of Letters of Credit. (a) The U.S. Borrower
agrees (i) to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any payment made by the Issuing
Lender under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of the U.S. Borrower on
the same Business Day that the U.S. Borrower shall have received notice from the
Issuing Lender that any such payment has been made, or, if the U.S. Borrower
shall have received such notice later than 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on
any Business Day, not later than 4:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
immediately following Business Day and (ii) to pay interest on any unreimbursed
portion of any such payment from the date of such

                                       38

<PAGE>

payment until reimbursement in full thereof at a rate per annum equal to (A) on
or prior to the date which is one Business Day after the day on which the U.S.
Borrower is required to reimburse the Issuing Lender for such payment in
accordance with clause (i) , the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
for the Revolving Credit Loans and (B) thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate plus
the Applicable Margin for the Revolving Credit Loans plus 2%.

          (b) In the event that the Issuing Lender makes a payment under any
Letter of Credit and is not reimbursed in full therefor in accordance with
paragraph (a) of this subsection 3.8, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify
the Administrative Agent, who will promptly notify each other U.S. Revolving
Credit Lender. Forthwith upon its receipt of any such notice, each such other
Lender will transfer to Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing
Lender, in immediately available funds, an amount equal to such other Lender's
pro rata share (based on its U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment) of the L/C
Obligation arising from such unreimbursed payment. Promptly, upon its receipt
from the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such other Lender of such amount,
the Issuing Lender will complete, execute and deliver to such other Lender an
L/C Participation Certificate dated the date of such receipt and in such amount.

          (c) Whenever, at any time after the Issuing Lender has made a payment
under any Letter of Credit and has received from any other U.S. Revolving Credit
Lender such other Lender's pro rata share of the L/C Obligation arising
therefrom, the Issuing Lender receives (directly or through the Administrative
Agent) any reimbursement on account of such L/C Obligation or any payment of
interest on account thereof, the Issuing Lender will promptly distribute to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of such other Lender, such other Lender's
pro rata share thereof in like funds as received; provided that in the event
that the receipt by the Issuing Lender of such reimbursement or such payment of
interest (as the case may be) is required to be returned, such other Lender will
return to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender, any
portion thereof previously distributed by the Administrative Agent to it in like
funds as such reimbursement or payment is required to be returned by the Issuing
Lender.

          3.9 Letter of Credit Fees. (a) In lieu of any letter of credit
commissions and fees provided for in any L/C Application relating to Standby
L/Cs or Commercial L/Cs (other than standard issuance, amendment and negotiation
fees, and the fronting fee referred to below), the U.S. Borrower agrees to pay
the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender and the
Participating Lenders, with respect to each Standby L/C or Commercial L/C issued
for the account of the U.S. Borrower, a Standby L/C or Commercial L/C fee, as
the case may be, equal to the Applicable Margin for Revolving Credit Loans which
are Eurodollar Loans per annum on the daily average amount available to be drawn
under each Standby L/C in the case of a Standby L/C and on the maximum face
amount of each Commercial L/C in the case of a Commercial L/C, in either case,
payable, in arrears, on the last Business Day of each Fiscal Quarter of the U.S.
Borrower. The Administrative Agent will disburse any Standby L/C or Commercial
L/C fees received pursuant to this subsection 3.9(a) to the respective
Participating Lenders promptly following the receipt of any such fees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,

                                       39

<PAGE>

the U.S. Borrower agrees to pay standard issuance, amendment and negotiation
fees, and a fronting fee in an amount to be agreed between the U.S. Borrower and
the Issuing Lender, to the Issuing Lender for its own account.

          (b) For purposes of any payment of fees required pursuant to this
subsection 3.9, the Administrative Agent agrees to provide to the U.S. Borrower
a statement of any such fees to be so paid; provided that the failure by the
Administrative Agent to provide the U.S. Borrower with any such invoice shall
not relieve the U.S. Borrower of its obligation to pay such fees.

          3.10 Letter of Credit Reserves. (a) If any Change in Law shall either
(i) impose, modify, deem or make applicable any reserve, special deposit,
assessment or similar requirement against letters of credit issued by the
Issuing Lender or (ii) impose on the Issuing Lender any other condition
regarding this Agreement (with respect to Letters of Credit) or any Letter of
Credit, and the result of any event referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above
shall be to increase the cost of the Issuing Lender of issuing or maintaining
any Letter of Credit in an amount deemed by the Issuing Lender to be material
(which increase in cost shall be the result of the Issuing Lender's reasonable
allocation of the aggregate of such cost increases resulting from such events),
then, from time to time following notice by the Issuing Lender to the U.S.
Borrower of such Change in Law, within 15 days after demand by the Issuing
Lender, the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender such additional
amounts which shall be sufficient to compensate the Issuing Lender for such
increased cost, together with interest on each such amount from the date payment
was required until payment in full thereof at a rate per annum equal to the rate
applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans pursuant to subsection 5.5(b).

          (b) In the event that any Change in Law with respect to the Issuing
Lender shall, in the opinion of the Issuing Lender, require that any obligation
under any Letter of Credit be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for
purposes of calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be maintained by
the Issuing Lender or any corporation controlling the Issuing Lender, and such
Change in Law shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
Issuing Lender's or such corporation's capital, as the case may be, as a
consequence of the Issuing Lender's obligations under such Letter of Credit to a
level below that which the Issuing Lender or such corporation, as the case may
be, could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into account the
Issuing Lender's or such corporation's policies, as the case may be, with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Issuing Lender to be
material, then from time to time following notice by the Issuing Lender to the
U.S. Borrower of such Change in Law, within 15 days after demand by the Issuing
Lender, the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Issuing Lender such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate the Issuing Lender or such corporation, as the
case may be, for such reduction. The Issuing Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of paragraph (a) or (b) of
this subsection 3.10 with respect to the Issuing Lender, it will, if requested
by the U.S. Borrower and to the extent permitted by law or by the relevant
Governmental Authority, endeavor in good faith to avoid or minimize the increase
in costs or reduction in payments resulting from such event; provided that such
avoidance or minimization can be made in such a manner that the Issuing Lender,
in its sole determination, suffers no

                                       40

<PAGE>

economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage. The U.S. Borrower shall not be
required to make any payments to the Issuing Lender for any additional amounts
pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection 3.10 unless the Issuing
Lender has given written notice to the U.S. Borrower of its intent to request
such payments prior to or within 60 days after the date on which the Issuing
Lender became entitled to claim such amounts. A certificate, in reasonable
detail setting forth the calculation of the amounts involved, submitted by the
Issuing Lender to the U.S. Borrower concurrently with any such demand by the
Issuing Lender, shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the amount
thereof.

          (c) The U.S. Borrower and each Participating Lender agree that the
provisions of the foregoing paragraphs (a) and (b) shall apply equally to each
Participating Lender in respect of its L/C Participating Interest in such Letter
of Credit, as if the references in such paragraphs and provisions referred to,
where applicable, such Participating Lender or, in the case of paragraph (b),
any corporation controlling such Participating Lender.

          3.11 Further Assurances. The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees, from time to
time, to do and perform any and all acts and to execute any and all further
instruments reasonably requested by the Issuing Lender more fully to effect the
purposes of this Agreement and the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder.

          3.12 Obligations Absolute. The payment obligations of the U.S.
Borrower under this Agreement with respect to the Letters of Credit shall be
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including, without limitation,
the following circumstances:

               (i) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
     which Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at
     any time against any beneficiary, or any transferee, of any Letter of
     Credit (or any Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee
     may be acting), the Issuing Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Lender,
     or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Credit
     Document, the transactions contemplated herein, or any unrelated
     transaction;

               (ii) any statement or any other document presented under any
     Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid or any
     statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

               (iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit
     against presentation of a draft or certificate or other document which does
     not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or is insufficient in
     any respect, except where such payment constitutes gross negligence or
     willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Lender as determined in the
     final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; or

                                       41

<PAGE>

               (iv) any other circumstances or happening whatsoever, whether or
     not similar to any of the foregoing, except for any such circumstances or
     happening constituting gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part
     of the Issuing Lender as determined in the final judgment of a court of
     competent jurisdiction.

          3.13 Assignments. No Participating Lender's participation in any
Letter of Credit or any of its rights or duties hereunder shall be subdivided,
assigned or transferred (other than in connection with a transfer of part or all
of such Participating Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment in accordance with
subsection 12.6(c)) without the prior written consent of the Issuing Lender,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Such consent may be given or
withheld without the consent or agreement of any other Participating Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participating Lender may subparticipate its L/C
Participating Interest without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Issuing Lender.

          3.14 Participations. The obligation of each U.S. Revolving Credit
Lender to purchase participating interests pursuant to subsection 3.6 shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
including, without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment,
defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Issuing Lender,
the U.S. Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the
occurrence or continuance of an Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in
the condition (financial or otherwise) of the U.S. Borrower; (iv) any breach of
this Agreement by the U.S. Borrower or any other Lender; or (v) any other
circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of
the foregoing.

          3.15 Increase in Revolving Credit Commitments. (a) So long as no Event
of Default then exists or would result therefrom, the U.S. Borrower shall have
the right at any time and from time to time and upon at least 10 Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify
each of the U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders), to request that one or more Lenders
(and/or one or more other Persons which will become Lenders as provided below)
provide Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments and, subject to the
applicable terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, make U.S. Revolving
Credit Loans pursuant thereto, it being understood and agreed, however, that (i)
no Lender shall be obligated to provide an Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitment as a result of any such request by the U.S. Borrower, (ii) until such
time, if any, as such Lender has agreed to provide an Additional U.S. Revolving
Credit Commitment and has executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent an
Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment Agreement in respect thereof as
provided in subsection 3.15(b) and such Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitment Agreement has become effective, such Lender shall not be obligated to
fund any Revolving Credit Loans in excess of its Revolving Credit Commitment as
in effect prior to giving effect to such Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitment provided pursuant to this subsection 3.15, (iii) the aggregate amount
of all Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments permitted to be provided
pursuant to this subsection 3.15 shall not exceed $25,000,000, (iv) the fees
payable to any Lender (including, in the circumstances

                                       42

<PAGE>

contemplated by clause (v) below, any Person who will become a Lender) providing
an Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment shall be as set forth in the
relevant Additional Revolving Credit Commitment Agreement, (v) if, after the
U.S. Borrower has requested the then existing U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders
(other than Non-Funding Lenders) to provide Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitments pursuant to this subsection 3.15 on the terms to be applicable
thereto, the U.S. Borrower has not received Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to that amount of the Additional U.S.
Revolving Credit Commitments which the U.S. Borrower desires to obtain pursuant
to such request (as set forth in the notice provided by the U.S. Borrower to the
Administrative Agent as provided above), then the U.S. Borrower may request
Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments from other Persons in an aggregate
amount equal to such deficiency on terms which are no more favorable to such
other Persons in any respect than the terms offered to the U.S. Revolving Credit
Lenders, (vi) any Lender (or, in the circumstances contemplated by clause (v)
above, other Person that will become a Lender) shall be subject to the prior
written approval of the Administrative Agent (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (vii) all actions taken by the U.S.
Borrower pursuant to this subsection 3.15(a) shall be done in coordination with
the Administrative Agent.

          (b) At the time of any provision of Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitments pursuant to this subsection 3.15, (i) the U.S. Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and each U.S. Revolving Credit Lender or other Person
(each, an "Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Lender") which agrees to provide an
Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment Agreement
(with the effectiveness of such Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Lender's
Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment to occur upon delivery of such
Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitment Agreement to the Administrative
Agent, the payment of any fees required in connection therewith and the
satisfaction of the other conditions in this subsection 3.15(b) to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent) and (ii) the U.S. Borrower
shall, in coordination with the Administrative Agent, repay outstanding U.S.
Revolving Credit Loans of certain of the U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders, and,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in subsection
7.2, borrow additional U.S. Revolving Credit Loans from certain other U.S.
Revolving Credit Lenders, in each case so that all of the U.S. Revolving Credit
Lenders participate in each outstanding borrowing of U.S. Revolving Credit Loans
pro rata on the basis of their respective U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments
(after giving effect to any increase in the U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments
pursuant to this subsection 3.15) and with the U.S. Borrower being obligated to
pay to the respective U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders the costs of the type
referred to in subsection 5.12 in connection with any such repayment and/or
borrowing. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each U.S. Revolving
Credit Lender as to the occurrence of each Additional U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitment Date, and (x) on each such date, the U.S. Revolving Credit
Commitments under, and for all purposes of, this Agreement shall be increased by
the aggregate amount of such Additional U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments, and
(y) on each such date Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised
U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments of the affected Lenders.

          SECTION 4. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE CANADIAN DOLLAR LOAN SUB-FACILITY

          4.1 The Canadian Dollar Loan Commitment. Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each Canadian Lender severally agrees to the extent of its
Available Canadian Revolving Credit Commitment to make revolving credit loans
(which shall be C$ Prime Loans) to, and, at the option of the Canadian Borrower,
to accept and purchase Bankers' Acceptances from, the Canadian Borrower from
time to time during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period. During the Revolving
Credit Commitment Period, the Canadian Borrower may use the commitment for C$
Prime Loans and Bankers' Acceptances provided for in this Section by borrowing,
prepaying or repaying the C$ Prime Loans or Bankers' Acceptances, in whole or in
part, and reborrowing, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

          4.2 Procedure for C$ Prime Loan Borrowing. The Canadian Borrower may
borrow C$ Prime Loans during the Revolving Credit Commitment Period on any
Business Day (Canada), provided that the Canadian Borrower shall give the
Canadian Administrative Agent irrevocable written or telephonic notice (in the
case of telephonic notice, to be promptly confirmed in writing) (which notice
must be received by the Canadian Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 noon,
Toronto time, one Business Day (Canada) prior to the requested Borrowing Date
(Canada)), specifying (a) the amount to be borrowed, (b) the number and location
of the account to which funds are to be disbursed and (c) the requested
Borrowing Date (Canada). Each borrowing of C$ Prime Loans shall be in an amount
equal to C$500,000 or a whole multiple of C$100,000 in excess thereof. Not later
than 11:00 A.M., Toronto time, on the Borrowing Date (Canada) specified in such
notice, each Canadian Lender shall make available to the Canadian Administrative
Agent at the office of the Canadian Administrative Agent specified in subsection
12.2 (or at such other location as the Canadian Administrative Agent may direct)
an amount in immediately available funds equal in amount to such Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the amount of the C$ Prime Loan to be
made. C$ Prime Loan proceeds received by the Canadian Administrative Agent
hereunder shall promptly be made available to the Canadian Borrower by the
Canadian Administrative Agent's making a wire transfer to the account of the
Canadian Borrower as specified by the Canadian Borrower in the notice of
borrowing with the aggregate amount actually received by the Canadian
Administrative Agent from the Canadian Lenders and in like funds as received by
the Canadian Administrative Agent.

          4.3 Bankers' Acceptances.

          (a) The Canadian Borrower may issue Bankers' Acceptances denominated
in C$ for, at the Canadian Borrower's option, acceptance and purchase by the
Canadian Lenders, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 4.3.

          (b) Procedures.

               (1) Notices. The Canadian Borrower shall notify the Canadian
Administrative Agent by irrevocable written or telephonic notice (in the case of

                                       44

<PAGE>

telephonic notice, to be promptly confirmed in writing) by 12:00 noon, Toronto
time, two Business Days (Canada) prior to the date of the relevant borrowing in
respect of any borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances, specifying (a) the
amount to be borrowed, (b) the number and location of the account to which funds
are to be disbursed and (c) the requested Borrowing Date (Canada). Promptly
following receipt of a notice of borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptances (or of
the continuation of Bankers' Acceptances by way of Refunding Bankers'
Acceptances pursuant to subsection 4.3(d) or the conversion of Bankers'
Acceptances pursuant to subsection 4.4, as the case may be), the Canadian
Administrative Agent shall so advise the Canadian Lenders and shall advise each
Canadian Lender of the aggregate face amount of the Bankers' Acceptances to be
accepted by it and the applicable term thereof (which shall be identical for all
Canadian Lenders).

               (2) Minimum Borrowing Amount. Each borrowing by way of Bankers'
Acceptances shall be in a minimum aggregate face amount of C$1,000,000 or a
whole multiple of C$100,000 in excess thereof.

               (3) Face Amounts. The face amount of each Bankers' Acceptance
shall be C$100,000 or any whole multiple thereof. The aggregate face amount of
each Banker's Acceptance to be accepted by a Canadian Lender shall be in an
integral multiple of C$100,000, and such face amount shall be in an amount equal
to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of such borrowing by way
of Bankers' Acceptances; provided that the Canadian Administrative Agent may, in
its sole discretion, increase or reduce any Canadian Lender's portion of such
Bankers' Acceptance to the nearest C$100,000.

               (4) Term. Bankers' Acceptances shall be issued and shall mature
on a Business Day (Canada). Each Bankers' Acceptance shall have a term of 30,
60, 90 or 180 days, shall mature on or before the Revolving Credit Termination
Date and shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Canadian
Lenders.

               (5) Bankers' Acceptances in Blank. To facilitate the acceptance
of Bankers' Acceptances under this Agreement, the Canadian Borrower shall, from
time to time as required, provide to each Canadian Lender Drafts duly executed
and endorsed in blank by the Canadian Borrower in quantities sufficient for such
Canadian Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder. In addition, the Canadian
Borrower hereby appoints each Canadian Lender as its attorney-in-fact with
respect to Bankers' Acceptances for which the Canadian Borrower has provided a
Bankers' Acceptance notice through the Canadian Administrative Agent:

               (i) to complete and sign on behalf of the Canadian Borrower,
     either manually or by facsimile or mechanical signature, the Drafts to
     create the Bankers' Acceptances;

               (ii) after the acceptance thereof by such Canadian Lender, to
     endorse on behalf of the Canadian Borrower, either manually or by facsimile
     or mechanical signature, such Bankers' Acceptance in favor of the
     applicable

                                       45

<PAGE>

     purchaser or endorsee thereof including, in such Canadian Lender's
     discretion, such Canadian Lender or a clearing house (as defined by the
     Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada)), if applicable;

               (iii) to deliver such Bankers' Acceptances to such purchaser or
     to deposit such Bankers' Acceptances with such clearing house, if
     applicable; and

               (iv) to comply with the procedures and requirements established
     from time to time by such Canadian Lender or such clearing house, if
     applicable, in respect of the delivery, transfer and collection of bankers'
     acceptances and depository bills.

     The Canadian Borrower recognizes and agrees that all Bankers' Acceptances
     signed, endorsed, delivered or deposited on its behalf by any Canadian
     Lender shall bind the Canadian Borrower as fully and effectually as if
     signed in the handwriting of and duly issued, delivered or deposited by the
     proper signing officer of the Canadian Borrower. Each Canadian Lender is
     hereby authorized to accept such Drafts or issue such Bankers' Acceptances
     endorsed in blank in such face amounts as may be determined by the
     applicable Canadian Lender in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
     provided that the aggregate amount thereof is less than or equal to the
     aggregate amount of Bankers' Acceptances required to be accepted by such
     Canadian Lender. No Canadian Lender shall be responsible or liable for its
     failure to accept a Bankers' Acceptance if the cause of such failure is, in
     whole or in part, due to the failure of the Canadian Borrower to provide
     duly executed and endorsed Drafts to such Canadian Lender on a timely
     basis, nor shall any Canadian Lender be liable for any damage, loss or
     other claim arising by reason of any loss or improper use of any such
     instrument except loss or improper use arising by reason of the gross
     negligence or willful misconduct of such Canadian Lender, its officers,
     employees, agents or representatives as determined in the final judgment of
     a court of competent jurisdiction. Each Canadian Lender shall exercise such
     care in the custody and safekeeping of Drafts as it would exercise in the
     custody and safekeeping of similar property owned by it. Each Canadian
     Lender will, upon the request of the Canadian Borrower, promptly advise the
     Canadian Borrower of the number and designation, if any, of Drafts then
     held by it for the Canadian Borrower. Each Canadian Lender shall maintain a
     record with respect to Drafts and Bankers' Acceptances (i) received by it
     from the Canadian Borrower in blank hereunder, (ii) voided by it for any
     reason, (iii) accepted by it hereunder, (iv) purchased by it hereunder and
     (v) canceled at their respective maturities. Each Canadian Lender further
     agrees to retain such records in the manner and for the statutory periods
     provided in the various Canadian provincial or federal statutes and
     regulations which apply to such Canadian Lender.

               (6) Execution of Bankers' Acceptances. Drafts of the Canadian
Borrower to be accepted as Bankers' Acceptances hereunder shall be duly executed
on behalf of the Canadian Borrower. Notwithstanding that any person whose
signature appears on any Bankers' Acceptance as a signatory for the Canadian
Borrower

                                       46

<PAGE>

may no longer be an authorized signatory for the Canadian Borrower at
the date of issuance of a Bankers' Acceptance, such signature shall nevertheless
be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if such authority had remained in
force at the time of such issuance, and any such Bankers' Acceptance so signed
shall be binding on the Canadian Borrower.

               (7) Acceptance of Bankers' Acceptances. Each Draft to be accepted
by a Canadian Lender shall be accepted by such Canadian Lender at its Canadian
Lending Office.

               (8) Purchase of Bankers' Acceptances. Each Canadian Lender shall
be required to purchase (subject to the commercial availability of a resale
market in the case of Bankers' Acceptances with a term of approximately 30, 60,
90 or 180 days, as the case may be) from the Canadian Borrower on the Borrowing
Date (Canada), at the Applicable BA Discount Rate, Bankers' Acceptances in an
amount equal to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the
Bankers' Acceptances to be accepted by the Canadian Lenders on such date and to
provide the BA Discount Proceeds thereof to the Canadian Administrative Agent at
the office of the Canadian Administrative Agent specified in subsection 12.2 (or
at such other location as the Canadian Administrative Agent may direct) not
later than 12:00 noon, Toronto time, on such Borrowing Date (Canada), for the
account of the Canadian Borrower. The Acceptance Fee payable by the Canadian
Borrower to each Canadian Lender under subsection 4.3(e) in respect of each
Bankers' Acceptance accepted and purchased by such Canadian Lender from the
Canadian Borrower shall be set off against the BA Discount Proceeds payable by
such Canadian Lender under this subsection 4.3(b)(8). Not later than 2:00 P.M.,
Toronto time, on such Borrowing Date (Canada), the Canadian Administrative Agent
shall make such BA Discount Proceeds available to the Canadian Borrower by the
Canadian Administrative Agent's making a wire transfer to the account of the
Canadian Borrower as specified by the Canadian Borrower in the notice of
borrowing with the aggregate amount actually received by the Canadian
Administrative Agent from the Canadian Lenders and in like funds as received by
the Canadian Administrative Agent.

               (9) Sale of Bankers' Acceptances. Each Canadian Lender may at any
time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise dispose of any or
all Bankers' Acceptances accepted and purchased by it.

               (10) Waiver of Presentment and Other Conditions. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, the Canadian Borrower waives presentment for
payment and any other defense to payment of any amounts due to any Canadian
Lender in respect of any Bankers' Acceptance accepted by it pursuant to this
Agreement that might exist solely by reason of such Bankers' Acceptance being
held, at the maturity thereof, by such Canadian Lender in its own right, and the
Canadian Borrower agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Canadian Lender
as holder sues the Canadian Borrower on the Bankers' Acceptances for payment of
the amount payable by the Canadian Borrower thereunder.

                                       47

<PAGE>

          (c) The Canadian Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to reimburse
each Canadian Lender for, and there shall become due and payable at 10:00 A.M.,
Toronto time, on the maturity date for each Bankers' Acceptance, an amount in
Canadian Dollars in same day funds equal to the face amount of such Bankers'
Acceptance. The Canadian Borrower shall make each such reimbursement payment (i)
by causing any proceeds of a Refunding Bankers' Acceptance issued in accordance
with subsection 4.3(d) or conversion of such Bankers' Acceptance in accordance
with subsection 4.4 to be applied in reduction of such reimbursement payment;
and (ii) by depositing the amount of such reimbursement payment (or any portion
thereof remaining unpaid after application of any proceeds referred to in clause
(i)) with the Canadian Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective
Canadian Lenders. The Canadian Borrower's payment in accordance with this
subsection 4.3(c) shall satisfy its obligations under any Bankers' Acceptance to
which it relates, and each Canadian Lender shall thereafter be solely
responsible for the payment of such Bankers' Acceptance.

          (d) The Canadian Borrower shall give irrevocable written or telephonic
notice (in the case of telephonic notice, to be promptly confirmed in writing)
to the Canadian Administrative Agent at or before 12:00 noon, Toronto time, two
Business Days (Canada) prior to the maturity date of each Bankers' Acceptance of
the Canadian Borrower's intention to issue a Bankers' Acceptance on such
maturity date (a "Refunding Bankers' Acceptance") to provide for the payment of
such maturing Bankers' Acceptance (it being understood that payments by the
Canadian Borrower and fundings by the Canadian Lenders in respect of each
maturing Bankers' Acceptance and the related Refunding Bankers' Acceptance shall
be made on a net basis reflecting the difference between the face amount of such
maturing Bankers' Acceptance and the BA Discount Proceeds (net of the applicable
Acceptance Fee) of such Refunding Bankers' Acceptance). If the Canadian Borrower
fails to give such notice or does not have sufficient funds on deposit in the
amount of reimbursement payment in accordance with subsection 4.3(c)(ii), the
Canadian Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that such maturing Bankers'
Acceptances be repaid with the proceeds of C$ Prime Loans (without any
requirement to give notice with respect thereto), commencing on the maturity
date of such maturing Bankers' Acceptances.

          (e) An Acceptance Fee shall be payable by the Canadian Borrower to
each Canadian Lender in advance (in the manner specified in subsection
4.3(b)(8)) upon the issuance of a Bankers' Acceptance to be accepted by such
Canadian Lender calculated at the rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin
for Revolving Credit Loans that are Eurodollar Loans, such Acceptance Fee to be
calculated on the face amount of such Bankers' Acceptance and to be computed on
the basis of the number of days in the term of such Bankers' Acceptance and a
year of 365 days.

          4.4 Conversion Option. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the Canadian Borrower may, prior to the Revolving Commitment Termination Date,
effective on any Business Day (Canada), convert, in whole or in part, C$ Prime
Loans into Bankers' Acceptances or vice versa upon giving to the Canadian
Administrative Agent prior irrevocable written or telephonic notice (in the case
of telephonic notice, to be promptly confirmed in writing) within the notice
period and in the form which would

                                       48

<PAGE>

be required to be given to the Canadian Administrative Agent in respect of the
category of C$ Loan into which the outstanding C$ Loan is to be converted in
accordance with the provisions of subsection 4.2 or 4.3, as applicable, provided
that:

          (a) no C$ Prime Loan may be converted into a Bankers' Acceptance when
any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

          (b) each conversion into Bankers' Acceptances shall be for an
aggregate amount of C$1,000,000 (and whole multiples of C$100,000 in excess
thereof), and each conversion to C$ Prime Loans shall be in an amount equal to
C$500,000 (or a whole multiple of C$100,000 in excess thereof); and

          (c) Bankers' Acceptances may be converted only on the maturity date of
such Bankers' Acceptances and, provided that, if less than all Bankers'
Acceptances are converted, then after such conversion not less than C$1,000,000
(and whole multiples of C$100,000 in excess thereof) shall remain as Bankers'
Acceptances.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Canadian Borrower requests a conversion
under this subsection 4.4 from Bankers' Acceptances into C$ Prime Loans, the
notice period shall be increased from one Business Day (Canada) to two Business
Days (Canada).

          4.5 Circumstances Making Bankers' Acceptances Unavailable.

          (a) If the Canadian Administrative Agent determines in good faith,
which determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Canadian
Borrower, and notifies the Canadian Borrower that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the money market, there is no market for Bankers' Acceptances, then:

               (i) the right of the Canadian Borrower to request a borrowing by
     way of Bankers' Acceptance shall be suspended until the Canadian
     Administrative Agent determines that the circumstances causing such
     suspension no longer exist and the Canadian Administrative Agent so
     notifies the Canadian Borrower; and

               (ii) any notice relating to a borrowing by way of Bankers'
     Acceptance that is outstanding at such time shall be deemed to be a notice
     requesting a borrowing by way of C$ Prime Loans (all as if it were a notice
     given pursuant to subsection 4.2).

          (b) The Canadian Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Canadian Borrower (with a copy to the Canadian Lenders) of the suspension of the
Canadian Borrower's right to request a borrowing by way of Bankers' Acceptance
and of the termination of such suspension.

          4.6 Reports. The Canadian Administrative Agent shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent, at any time and from time to time when the Administrative
Agent may so request, a statement, substantially in the form of Exhibit O,
showing (i) the aggregate principal amount of C$ Prime Loans outstanding from
the Canadian Lenders as

                                       49

<PAGE>

of the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of
such report, (ii) the aggregate undiscounted face amount of Bankers' Acceptances
outstanding from the Canadian Lenders as of the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding the date of such report and (iii) such other
matters as are contained therein. The Canadian Administrative Agent hereby
agrees to deliver a copy of each such statement to the U.S. Borrower, the
Canadian Borrower or any Lender promptly upon the request of any such Person.

          4.7 Use of Proceeds of C$ Loans. The proceeds of the C$ Prime Loans
and the Bankers' Acceptances (or BA Loans) hereunder shall be used by the
Canadian Borrower to finance the working capital needs and for the general
corporate purposes of the Canadian Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

          4.8 Non-BA Lenders. If a Canadian Lender is not a Schedule I Bank,
Schedule II Bank or Schedule III Bank, or if it notifies the Canadian
Administrative Agent in writing that it is otherwise unable to accept bankers'
acceptances, such Canadian Lender shall give notice to such effect to the
Canadian Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., Toronto time, on the date of
any requested credit extension by way of Bankers' Acceptances (which notice may,
if so stated therein, remain in effect with respect to subsequent requests for
extension of credit by way of Bankers' Acceptances until revoked by notice to
the Canadian Administrative Agent) and shall make available to the Canadian
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Canadian Borrower, in accordance
with subsection 4.3(b)(8) hereof, on the applicable Borrowing Date (Canada), a
loan in Canadian Dollars (a "BA Loan") in the principal amount equal to the BA
Discount Proceeds of a notional Bankers' Acceptance equal in amount to such
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Percentage of the total amount of credit
requested to be extended by way of Bankers' Acceptances and for the same term as
the Draft that such Canadian Lender would have otherwise been required to accept
and purchase hereunder.

          SECTION 5. GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO LOANS

          5.1 Procedure for Borrowing. (a) The U.S. Borrower may borrow under
the Commitments on any Business Day (or, with respect to any borrowing of a
Canadian Revolving Credit Loan, on any Business Day (Canada)); provided that,
with respect to any borrowing, the U.S. Borrower shall give the Administrative
Agent irrevocable notice, which notice must be received by the Administrative
Agent (i) prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, three Business Days prior to
the requested Borrowing Date if all or any part of the Loans are to be
Eurodollar Loans under the U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) prior to 1:00
P.M., New York City time, on the requested Borrowing Date if the borrowing is to
be solely of Alternate Base Rate Loans under the U.S. Revolving Credit

Revolving Credit Commitments have been fully utilized) (x) prior to 1:00 P.M.,
New York City time, four Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date if
all or any part of the Loans are to be Eurodollar Loans under the Canadian
Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City time, two
Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date if the borrowing is to be

                                       50

<PAGE>

Loans under the Canadian Revolving Credit Commitments, and must specify (A) the
amount of the borrowing, (B) the number and location of the account to which
funds are to be disbursed, (C) whether such Loans are initially to be Eurodollar
Loans or Alternate Base Rate Loans or a combination thereof, (D) if the
borrowing is to be entirely or partly Eurodollar Loans, the length of the
Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loans and (E) whether the Loan is a Term
Loan, a Swing Line Loan or Revolving Credit Loan. Upon receipt of such notice
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected U.S. Lender thereof
and, in the case of any borrowing which is to include Canadian Revolving Credit
Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Canadian
Administrative Agent, which shall promptly notify each affected Canadian Lender.
Not later than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in
such notice, each affected Lender shall make available to the Administrative
Agent at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in subsection 12.2 (or
at such other location as the Administrative Agent may direct) an amount in
immediately available funds equal to the amount of the Loan to be made by such
Lender (except that proceeds of Swing Line Loans will be made available to the
U.S. Borrower in accordance with subsection 3.4(a)). Loan proceeds received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder shall promptly be made available to the U.S.
Borrower by the Administrative Agent's making a wire transfer to the account of
the U.S. Borrower as specified by the U.S. Borrower in the notice of borrowing
with the aggregate amount actually received by the Administrative Agent from the
Lenders and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent.

          (b) Any borrowing of Eurodollar Loans hereunder shall be in such
amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, after giving effect
thereto, (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Eurodollar Loans having the
same Interest Period shall not be less than $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$500,000 in excess thereof and (ii) no more than sixteen Interest Periods shall
be in effect at any one time.

          5.2 Conversion and Continuation Options. (a) Subject to subsection
5.12, the U.S. Borrower may elect from time to time to convert Eurodollar Loans
into Alternate Base Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent irrevocable
notice of such election, to be received by the Administrative Agent prior to
12:00 noon, New York City time, at least three Business Days prior to the
proposed conversion date. The U.S. Borrower may elect from time to time to
convert all or a portion of the Alternate Base Rate Loans (other than Swing Line
Loans) then outstanding to Eurodollar Loans by giving the Administrative Agent
irrevocable notice of such election, to be received by the Administrative Agent
prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, at least three Business Days prior to
the proposed conversion date, specifying the Interest Period selected therefor,
and, if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such
conversion shall be made on the requested conversion date or, if such requested
conversion date is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day. Upon
receipt of any notice pursuant to this subsection 5.2, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each affected Lender thereof. All or any part of the
outstanding Loans (other than Swing Line Loans) may be converted as provided
herein; provided that partial conversions of Alternate Base Loans shall be in
the aggregate principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof and the aggregate principal

                                       51

<PAGE>

amount of the resulting Eurodollar Loans outstanding in respect of any one
Interest Period shall be at least $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in
excess thereof.

          (b) Any Eurodollar Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration
of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the U.S. Borrower
giving notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in subsection 1.1, of the
length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans; provided that
no Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such (i) when any Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
have, by written notice to the U.S. Borrower, determined that such a
continuation is not appropriate, (ii) if, after giving effect thereto,
subsection 5.1(b) would be contravened or (iii) after the date that is one month
prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date (in the case of continuations of
Revolving Credit Loans) or the final Installment Payment Date of the Term Loans.

          5.3 Changes of Commitment Amounts. (a) The U.S. Borrower shall have
the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the Applicable
Administrative Agent, to terminate or from time to time to permanently reduce
the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class, subject to the provisions of this
subsection 5.3; provided that the Revolving Credit Lenders agree that the
Applicable Administrative Agent may, in connection with any termination of the
Revolving Credit Commitments, waive such notice requirement on behalf of itself
and the Revolving Credit Lenders of the applicable Class. With respect to any
reduction of the U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments, to the extent, if any, that
the Aggregate U.S. Revolving Credit Exposure as of the date of determination
exceeds the amount of the U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments as then reduced, the
U.S. Borrower shall be required to make a prepayment equal to such excess
amount, the proceeds of which shall be applied, first, to payment of the Swing
Line Loans then outstanding, second, to payment of the U.S. Revolving Credit
Loans then outstanding, third, to payment of any L/C Obligations then
outstanding, and, fourth, to cash collateralize any outstanding Letters of
Credit on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. With
respect to any reduction of the Canadian Revolving Credit Commitments, to the
extent, if any, that the Aggregate Canadian Revolving Credit Exposure as of the
date of determination exceeds the amount of the Canadian Revolving Credit
Commitments as then reduced, the U.S. Borrower (in the case of Canadian
Revolving Credit Loans) or the Canadian Borrower (in the case of C$ Loans) shall
be required to make a prepayment equal to such excess amount, the proceeds of
which shall be applied, first, to the payment of the Canadian Revolving Credit
Loans then outstanding, second, to the payment of C$ Prime Loans then
outstanding, third, to the payment of BA Loans then outstanding and, fourth, to
the cash collateralization of any Bankers' Acceptances then outstanding on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Canadian Administrative Agent. Any complete
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be
accompanied by prepayment in full of (i) in the case of the U.S. Revolving
Credit Commitments, the U.S. Revolving Credit Loans, Swing Line Loans and L/C
Obligations then outstanding and by cash collateralization, backstop or
termination (at the U.S. Borrower's election) of any outstanding Letters of
Credit on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and (ii) in
the case of the Canadian Revolving Credit Commitments, the Canadian Revolving
Credit Loans, C$

                                       52

<PAGE>

Prime Loans and BA Loans and by cash collateralization of any Bankers'
Acceptances then outstanding on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Canadian
Administrative Agent (with such prepayment to be made by the U.S. Borrower, in
the case of Canadian Revolving Credit Loans, and by the Canadian Borrower in all
other cases). Upon termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, any Letter
of Credit then outstanding that has been so cash collateralized or backstopped
by a letter of credit in a face amount equal to 105% of the undrawn face amount
of the Letter of Credit being backstopped with terms and conditions and from a
financial institution acceptable to the Issuing Lender in its sole discretion
(each, a "Backstop L/C") shall no longer be considered a "Letter of Credit" as
defined in subsection 1.1 and any L/C Participating Interests heretofore granted
by the Issuing Lender to the U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders in such Letter of
Credit shall be deemed terminated (subject to automatic reinstatement in the
event that such cash collateral is returned or Backstop L/C is terminated or
cancelled and the Issuing Lender is not fully reimbursed for any such L/C
Obligations) but the Letter of Credit fees payable under subsection 3.9 shall
continue to accrue to the Issuing Lender (or, in the event of any such automatic
reinstatement, to the Issuing Lender and the Participating Lenders as provided
in subsection 3.9) with respect to such Letter of Credit until the expiry
thereof (provided that in lieu of paying a Standby or Commercial L/C fee, as the
case may be, equal to the Applicable Margin for Revolving Credit Loans which are
Eurodollar Loans per annum, the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Issuing Lender (and, if applicable in the event of
any such automatic reinstatement, the Participating Lenders), an amount equal to
0.25% per annum).

          (b) In the case of termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit
Commitments of any Class, interest accrued on the amount of any prepayment
relating thereto and any unpaid commitment fee accrued hereunder shall be paid
on the date of such termination or reduction. Any such partial reduction of the
Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount of $1,000,000 or
a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof and shall, in each case, reduce
permanently the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class then in
effect.

          5.4 Optional and Mandatory Prepayments; Repayments of Term Loans. (a)
Subject to subsection 5.12, the U.S. Borrower may at any time and from time to
time prepay U.S. Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, by
irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent by 10:00 A.M., New York City
time, on the same Business Day (or, in the case of Swing Line Loans, by
irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent by 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the same Business Day) in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans, and
three Business Days' irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent in the case
of Eurodollar Loans, specifying the date and amount of prepayment and whether
the prepayment is of Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans. Upon receipt of such
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender
thereof. If such notice is given, the U.S. Borrower shall make such prepayment,
and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable, on the
date specified therein. Partial prepayments (i) of Term Loans shall be in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the lesser of (A) (I) $1,000,000, or a whole
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof with respect to Eurodollar Loans or (II)
$500,000, or a whole

                                       53

<PAGE>

multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof with respect to Alternate Base Rate Loans
and (B) the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans, and (ii) of
Revolving Credit Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
lesser of (A) (I) $1,000,000, or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof
with respect to Eurodollar Loans or (II) $500,000, or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof with respect to Alternate Base Rate Loans and (B) the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans, as the case may
be. Prepayments of the Term Loans pursuant to this subsection 5.4(a) shall be
applied first, to any installment due to be paid within twelve months of such
prepayment and, second, ratably to the remaining installments thereof based on
the outstanding amount of such remaining installments thereof.

          (b) (i) So long as any Term Loans are outstanding, if, subsequent to
the Closing Date, the Parent, Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries shall issue any Capital Stock, 50% of the Net Proceeds thereof
(excluding amounts provided by the Investor Group or their Affiliates or by
employees of such issuer) shall be promptly applied toward the prepayment of the
Term Loans with such application being made first, to any installment due to be
paid within twelve months of such prepayment and, second, ratably to the
remaining installments thereof based on the outstanding amount of such remaining
installments; provided that Net Proceeds of such issuance shall be deemed to be
Net Proceeds of such issuance for purposes of this subsection 5.4(b)(i) only
after deducting therefrom any cash proceeds therefrom actually applied to the
redemption of (a) any then outstanding aggregate principal amount of Bridge Debt
(including all accrued interest on such Indebtedness and the amount of all
expenses, premium or penalties associated therewith) and (b) up to 35% of any
Permitted Notes under any "equity clawback" provisions and (c) up to 35% of the
Preferred Stock under any "equity clawback" provisions and, in the case of
clauses (b) and (c), the payment of any expenses, premiums, penalties or accrued
interest with respect thereto; provided that, if at the time of any such
issuance, the Leverage Ratio as of the last day of the most recently ended
Fiscal Quarter of the U.S. Borrower is (A) less than 2.75 to 1.00 and greater
than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00, an amount equal to 25% of the Net Proceeds
thereof shall be applied as set forth above and (B) less than 2.00 to 1.00, no
such prepayment shall be required in respect of such Net Proceeds.

               (ii) If, subsequent to the Closing Date, Holdings, the U.S.
     Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall incur or permit the incurrence of
     any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness permitted pursuant to subsection
     9.1, unless otherwise specified in such subsection), 100% of the Net
     Proceeds thereof shall be promptly applied toward the prepayment of the
     Term Loans with such application being made first, to any installment due
     to be paid within twelve months of such prepayment and, second, ratably to
     the remaining installments thereof based on the outstanding amount of
     remaining installments.

               (iii) If, subsequent to the Closing Date, the U.S. Borrower or
     any of its Subsidiaries shall receive Net Proceeds from any Asset Sale,
     such Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied toward the prepayment of the
     Term Loans with such application being made first, to any installment due
     to be

                                       54

<PAGE>

     paid within twelve months of such prepayment and, second, ratably to the
     remaining installments thereof based on the outstanding amount of such
     remaining installments; provided that such Net Proceeds need not be applied
     to the prepayment of the Term Loans until the earlier of the date that the
     aggregate amount of Net Proceeds received by the U.S. Borrower or any of
     its Subsidiaries from any Asset Sales exceeds $1,000,000 (and has not yet
     been applied to the prepayment of the Term Loans hereunder) and the date
     which is six months after the last application of Net Proceeds pursuant to
     this subsection 5.4(b)(iii).

               (iv) If for any Fiscal Year of the U.S. Borrower commencing with
     the first complete Fiscal Year ending after the Closing Date, there shall
     be Excess Cash Flow for such Fiscal Year, 75% of such Excess Cash Flow
     shall be promptly applied toward prepayment of the Term Loans with such
     application being made first, to any installment due to be paid within
     twelve months of such prepayment and, second, ratably to the remaining
     installments thereof based on the outstanding amount of such remaining
     installments; provided that, if the Leverage Ratio as of the last day of
     the fourth quarter of the Fiscal Year for which such prepayment is being
     made is (A) less than 3.00 to 1.00 and greater than or equal to 2.00 to
     1.00, an amount equal to 50% of such Excess Cash Flow shall be applied as
     set forth above and (B) less than 2.00 to 1.00, no such prepayment shall be
     required with respect to such Excess Cash Flow. Each such prepayment shall
     be made not later than 120 days after the end of such Fiscal Year.

               (v) The U.S. Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent (which
     shall promptly notify each affected Lender) at least one Business Day's
     notice of each prepayment or mandatory reduction pursuant to this
     subsection 5.4(b) setting forth the date and amount thereof. Except as
     otherwise may be agreed by the Administrative Agent, as agent for the
     Required Lenders, any prepayment of Loans pursuant to this subsection 5.4
     shall be applied, first, to any Alternate Base Rate Loans then outstanding
     and the balance of such prepayment, if any, to the Eurodollar Loans then
     outstanding; provided that prepayments of Eurodollar Loans, if not on the
     last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto, shall be prepaid
     subject to the provisions of subsection 5.12 or, at the option of the U.S.
     Borrower with respect to any mandatory prepayment, the amount of such
     prepayment (after application to any Alternate Base Rate Loans) shall be
     deposited with the Administrative Agent as cash collateral for the Loans on
     terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and thereafter
     shall be applied in the order of the Interest Periods next ending most
     closely to the date such prepayment is required to be made and on the last
     day of each such Interest Period. After such application, unless an Event
     of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any remaining interest
     earned on such cash collateral shall be paid to the U.S. Borrower.

                                       55

          (c) The Term Loans shall be repaid in consecutive semi-annual
installments on the dates set forth below (each such day, an "Installment
Payment Date"), in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) the
percentage specified for each such Installment Payment Date multiplied by (ii)
the aggregate amount of the outstanding Term Loans on the Change of Control
Payment Date (after giving effect to any Change of Control Term Loans made on
such date):

Amounts repaid on account of the Term Loans pursuant to this subsection or
otherwise paid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed.
Accrued interest on the amount of any prepayments shall be paid on the Interest
Payment Date next succeeding the date of any partial prepayment in the case of
any Alternate Base Rate Loans and on the date of such prepayment in the case of
any Eurodollar Loans or a prepayment in full of the Term Loans.

          (d) The Canadian Borrower may, subject to subsection 5.12, at any time
and from time to time, prepay the C$ Loans in whole or in part, without premium
or penalty, provided that the Canadian Borrower shall give the Canadian
Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' (Canada) irrevocable notice of
each such prepayment in the case of C$ Prime Loans, and three Business Days'
(Canada) irrevocable notice of each such prepayment in the case of Bankers'
Acceptances, specifying (i) the date and amount of such prepayment (which, in
the case of any Bankers' Acceptance, shall be the full undiscounted face amount
thereof) and (ii) whether the amounts prepaid are on account of C$ Prime Loans
or Bankers' Acceptances. If such notice is given, the

                                       56

<PAGE>

Canadian Borrower shall make such prepayment, and the payment amount specified
in such notice shall be due and payable, on the date specified therein. Partial
prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount of C$1,000,000 or a whole
multiple of C$500,000 in excess thereof with respect to Bankers' Acceptances,
and C$500,000 or a whole multiple of C$100,000 in excess there of in the case of
C$ Prime Loans.

          (e) If, at any time, the U.S. Borrower shall cease to own 100% of the
Capital Stock of the Canadian Borrower, all C$ Loans outstanding at such time
shall become immediately due and payable in full by the Canadian Borrower, and
the right of the Canadian Borrower to borrow C$ Loans hereunder shall be
immediately terminated.

          (f) If, on any Calculation Date, the Aggregate Canadian Revolving
Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate Canadian Revolving Credit Commitments,
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof on such Calculation Date
to the Borrowing Parties and, on the immediately succeeding Reset Date, the
Canadian Borrower shall repay or prepay C$ Loans in an amount sufficient to
eliminate such excess.

          (g) All payments and optional prepayments (other than prepayments as
set forth in subsection 5.11 with respect to increased costs) of Eurodollar
Loans hereunder shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections
so that, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of all
Eurodollar Loans with the same Interest Period shall not be less than $1,000,000
or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof.

          5.5 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Eurodollar Loans shall bear
interest for each day during each Interest Period applicable thereto, commencing
on (and including) the first day of such Interest Period to, but excluding, the
last day of such Interest Period, on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate determined for such Interest Period
plus the Applicable Margin.

          (b) Alternate Base Rate Loans shall bear interest for the period from
and including the date such Loans are made to, but excluding, the maturity date
thereof, or to, but excluding, the conversion date if such Loans are earlier
converted into Eurodollar Loans, on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a
rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

          (c) C$ Prime Loans shall bear interest for the period from and
including the date such Loans are made to, but excluding, the maturity date
thereof, or to, but excluding the conversion date if such Loans are earlier
converted into Bankers' Acceptances, on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a
rate per annum equal to the C$ Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin for
Revolving Credit Loans that are Alternate Base Rate Loans.

          (d) If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of any of the
Loans or any Bankers' Acceptance, (ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any
other amount payable by a Credit Party hereunder or under any other Credit
Document, shall not be

                                       57

<PAGE>

paid when due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise),
then any such Loan, if a Eurodollar Loan, shall be converted into an Alternate
Base Rate Loan at the end of the then-current Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Loan (which conversion shall occur automatically and without need for
compliance with the conditions for conversion set forth in subsection 5.2), and
any such overdue amount shall, without limiting the rights of the Lenders under
Section 10, bear interest (which shall be payable on demand) at a rate per annum
which is (x) in the case of a Loan, 2% plus the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin (or, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, the Eurodollar Rate for
the Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin plus 2%, if higher), or (y) in
all other cases, equal to the rate that would be applicable to an Alternate Base
Rate Term Loan plus 2.00%, in each case from the date of such non-payment until
paid in full (as well after as before judgment).

          (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this subsection 5.5,
interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date.

          (f) (i) If any provision of this Agreement would obligate any party to
this Agreement to make any payment of interest or other amount payable to any
Canadian Lender in an amount or calculated at a rate that would be prohibited by
law or would result in a receipt by the such Lender of interest at a criminal
rate (as such terms are construed under the Criminal Code (Canada)), then
notwithstanding such provision, such amount or rate shall be deemed to have been
adjusted with retroactive effect to the maximum amount or rate of interest, as
the case may be, as would not be so prohibited by law or so result in a receipt
by such Lender of interest at a criminal rate, such adjustment to be effected,
to the extent necessary, as follows:

          (x) first, by reducing the amount or rates of interest required to be
paid under this subsection 5.5; and

          (y) thereafter, by reducing any fees, commissions, premiums and other
amounts that would constitute interest for purposes of Section 347 of the
Criminal Code (Canada).

               (ii) If, notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this
     subsection 5.5(f), and after giving effect to all adjustments contemplated
     thereby, any Canadian Lender shall have received an amount in excess of the
     maximum permitted by such clause, then the party having paid such amount
     shall be entitled, by notice in writing to such Lender, to obtain
     reimbursement from such Lender of an amount equal to such excess, and,
     pending such reimbursement, such amount shall be deemed to be an amount
     payable by such Lender to such party.

               (iii) Any amount or rate of interest referred to in this
     subsection 5.5(f) shall be determined in accordance with generally accepted
     actuarial practices and principles as an effective annual rate of interest
     over the term of any C$ Prime Loan on the assumption that any charges, fees
     or expenses that fall within the meaning of "interest" (as defined in the
     Criminal

                                       58

     Code (Canada)) shall, if they relate to a specific period of time, be
     prorated over that period of time and otherwise be prorated over the
     Revolving Credit Commitment Period and, in the event of dispute, a
     certificate of a Fellow of the Canadian Institute of Actuaries appointed by
     the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive for the purposes of such
     determination absent manifest error.

          5.6 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) (i) Interest in respect of
Alternate Base Rate Loans, at any time that the Alternate Base Rate is
determined by reference to the Prime Rate and (ii) interest in respect of C$
Prime Loans (and all other amounts denominated in C$) shall be calculated on the
basis of a 365 (or 366 as the case may be) day year for the actual days elapsed.
Interest in respect of (x) Eurodollar Loans and in respect of Alternate Base
Rate Loans at any time that the Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference
to the Federal Funds Effective Rate and (y) all fees hereunder shall be
calculated on the basis of a 360 day year for the actual days elapsed. The
Administrative Agent shall as soon as practicable notify the U.S. Borrower and
the Lenders of each determination of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the
interest rate on a Loan resulting from a change in the Alternate Base Rate or
the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become effective as of the opening
of business on the day on which such change in the Alternate Base Rate is
announced or such change in the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements becomes
effective, as the case may be. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the U.S. Borrower and the Lenders of the effective date and
the amount of each such change.

          (b) For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) and disclosure
thereunder, whenever any interest or fee to be paid hereunder or in connection
herewith is to be calculated on the basis of any period of time that is less
than a calendar year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in such
calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of
days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by
360 or 365, as applicable. The rates of interest under this Agreement are
nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed
reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this
Agreement.

          (c) Each determination of an interest rate by the Applicable
Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrowing Parties and the Lenders in the absence
of manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the U.S.
Borrower, or any Lender, deliver to the U.S. Borrower or such Lender a statement
showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining the
Eurodollar Rate.

          5.7 Certain Fees. The U.S. Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, the fees separately agreed to in
writing from time to time by the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower.

          5.8 Inability to Determine Interest Rate. In the event that the
Administrative Agent shall have determined (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be conclusive and binding upon the U.S. Borrower) that (a) by
reason of

                                       59

<PAGE>

circumstances affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period
with respect to (i) proposed Loans that the U.S. Borrower has requested be made
as Eurodollar Loans, (ii) any Eurodollar Loans that will result from the
requested conversion of all or part of the Alternate Base Rate Loans into
Eurodollar Loans or (iii) the continuation of any Eurodollar Loan as such for an
additional Interest Period, or (b) dollar deposits in the relevant amount and
for the relevant period with respect to any such Eurodollar Loan are not
generally available to the Lenders in their respective Eurodollar Lending
Offices' interbank Eurodollar markets, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith
give telecopy or e-mail notice of such determination, confirmed in writing, to
the U.S. Borrower and the Lenders at least one day prior to, as the case may be,
the requested Borrowing Date, the conversion date or the last day of such
Interest Period. If such notice is given (i) any requested Eurodollar Loans
shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Loans, (ii) any Alternate Base Rate Loans
that were to have been converted to Eurodollar Loans shall be continued as
Alternate Base Rate Loans, and (iii) any outstanding Eurodollar Loans shall be
converted on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto
into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Until such notice has been withdrawn by the
Administrative Agent (which the Administrative Agent agrees to do when the
circumstances that prompted delivery of such notice no longer exist), no further
Eurodollar Loans shall be made and no Alternate Base Rate Loans shall be
converted to Eurodollar Loans.

          5.9 Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Except to the extent
otherwise provided herein, each borrowing of Loans by a Borrowing Party from the
Lenders and any reduction of the Commitments of any Class of the Lenders
hereunder shall be made pro rata according to the relevant Commitment
Percentages of the Lenders with respect to the Loans borrowed or the Commitments
of the Class to be reduced.

          (b) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under
this Agreement or any Note or any other Credit Document is insufficient to pay
in full all amounts then due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the
applicable Lenders under this Agreement:

               (i) If the Administrative Agent has not received a Payment
     Sharing Notice (or, if the Administrative Agent has received a Payment
     Sharing Notice but the Event of Default specified in such Payment Sharing
     Notice has been cured or waived in accordance with the provisions of this
     Agreement), such payment shall be distributed by the Administrative Agent
     and applied by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in the following
     order: first, to the payment of fees and expenses due and payable to the
     Administrative Agent under and in connection with this Agreement and the
     other Credit Documents; second, to the payment of all expenses due and
     payable under subsection 12.5, ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
     the aggregate amount of such payments owed to each such Lender; third, to
     the payment of fees due and payable under subsections 3.2 and 3.9, ratably
     among the Lenders in accordance with the Commitment Percentage of each
     Lender of the Commitment for which such payment is owed and, in the case of
     the Issuing Lender, the amount retained by the Issuing Lender for its own

                                       60

<PAGE>

     account pursuant to subsection 3.9; fourth, to the payment of interest then
     due and payable on the Loans and the L/C Obligations ratably in accordance
     with the aggregate amount of interest owed to each such Lender; and, fifth,
     to the payment of the principal amount of the Loans and the L/C Obligations
     which is then due and payable ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
     the aggregate principal amount owed to each such Lender; or

               (ii) If the Administrative Agent has received a Payment Sharing
     Notice which remains in effect, all payments received by the Administrative
     Agent under this Agreement or any Note shall be distributed by the
     Administrative Agent and applied by the Administrative Agent and the
     Lenders in the following order: first, to the payment of all amounts
     described in clauses "first" through "third" of the foregoing clause (i) in
     the order set forth therein; second, to the payment of the interest accrued
     on all Loans and L/C Obligations, regardless of whether any such amount is
     then due and payable, ratably among the Lenders in accordance with the
     aggregate accrued interest plus the aggregate principal amount of all Loans
     and L/C Obligations then due and payable and owed to such Lender; and,
     third, to the payment of the principal amount of all Loans and L/C
     Obligations, regardless of whether any such amount is then due and payable,
     ratably among the Lenders in accordance with the aggregate principal amount
     owed to such Lender.

The provisions of this subsection 5.9(b) shall apply mutatis mutandis to any
Payment Sharing Notice received by the Canadian Administrative Agent and to any
payments received by the Canadian Administrative Agent and the distribution
thereof by the Canadian Administrative Agent.

          (c) If any Revolving Credit Lender (a "Non-Funding Lender") has (x)
failed to make a Revolving Credit Loan or a C$ Loan required to be made by it
hereunder and the Applicable Administrative Agent has determined that such
Lender is not likely to make such Revolving Credit Loan or such C$ Loan or (y)
given notice to any Borrowing Party or either of the Administrative Agents that
it will not make, or that it has disaffirmed or repudiated any obligation to
make, any Revolving Credit Loan or any C$ Loan as required hereunder, in each
case by reason of the provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery
and Enforcement Act of 1989, as amended, or otherwise, (i) any payment made on
account of the principal of the Revolving Credit Loans or any C$ Loan
outstanding shall be made as follows:

          (A) in the case of any such payment made on any date when and to the
     extent that in the determination of the Applicable Administrative Agent the
     relevant Borrowing Party would be able under the terms and conditions
     hereof to reborrow the amount of such payment under the Commitments and to
     satisfy any applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 7 to such
     reborrowing, such payment shall be made on account of the outstanding
     Revolving Credit Loans or C$ Loans, as applicable, held by the Lenders
     other than the Non-Funding Lender pro rata according to the respective
     outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Loans or C$ Loans, as
     applicable, of such Lenders; and

                                       61

<PAGE>

          (B) otherwise, such payment shall be made on account of the
     outstanding Revolving Credit Loans or C$ Loans, as applicable, held by the
     applicable Lenders pro rata according to the respective outstanding
     principal amounts of such Revolving Credit Loans or C$ Loans, as
     applicable; and

               (ii) any payment made on account of interest on the Revolving
     Credit Loans or C$ Loans, as applicable, shall be made pro rata according
     to the respective amounts of accrued and unpaid interest due and payable on
     the Revolving Credit Loans or C$ Loans, as applicable, with respect to
     which such payment is being made. The relevant Borrowing Party agrees to
     give the Applicable Administrative Agent such assistance in making any
     determination pursuant to subparagraph (i)(A) of this paragraph as the
     Applicable Administrative Agent may reasonably request. Any such
     determination by the Applicable Administrative Agent shall be conclusive
     and binding on the Lenders.

          (d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the U.S.
Borrower on account of principal, interest and fees shall be made without
set-off or counterclaim and shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the applicable Lenders at the Administrative Agent's office located
at Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010 (or such other place as the
Administrative Agent shall notify the U.S. Borrower from time to time in
accordance with subsection 12.2), in Dollars and in immediately available funds.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such payments in accordance
with the provisions of subsection 5.9(b) or (c) upon receipt in like funds as
received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurodollar Loans)
would become due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall become due and payable on the next succeeding Business Day and, with
respect to payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then
applicable rate during such extension. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan
becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and with respect to
payments of principal, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable
rate during such extension), unless the result of such extension would be to
extend such payment into another calendar month in which event such payment
shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. All payments (including
prepayments) to be made by the Canadian Borrower hereunder, whether on account
of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall be made without set off or
counterclaim and shall be made to the Canadian Administrative Agent, for the
account of the Canadian Lenders, at the Canadian Administrative Agent's office
located at One First Canadian Place, Suite 3000, P.O. Box 301, Toronto, Ontario,
Canada M5X 1C9 (or such other place as the Canadian Administrative Agent shall
notify the Canadian Borrower from time to time in accordance with subsection
12.2), in Canadian Dollars and in immediately available funds (provided,
however, that all amounts in respect of commitment fees payable by the Canadian
Borrower pursuant to subsection 3.2 shall be paid in Dollars and in immediately
available funds). If any payment hereunder becomes due and payable on a day
other than a Business Day (Canada), such payments shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day (Canada) (and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension), unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment
into

                                       62

<PAGE>

another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day (Canada). If any date for performance of any
non-monetary obligation of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary would
occur on a day other than a Business Day or Business Day (Canada), as
applicable, such date for performance shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day or Business Day (Canada), respectively.

          (e) Unless the Applicable Administrative Agent shall have been
notified in writing by any Lender prior to a borrowing that such Lender will not
make the amount which would constitute its Commitment Percentage of such
borrowing available to the Applicable Administrative Agent, the Applicable
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available
to the Applicable Administrative Agent, in accordance with subsection 4.2, 4.3
or 5.1, as applicable, and the Applicable Administrative Agent may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian
Borrower, as the case may be, a corresponding amount. If such amount is not made
available to the Applicable Administrative Agent by the required time on the
Borrowing Date or Borrowing Date (Canada), as the case may be, therefor, such
Lender shall pay to the Applicable Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount
with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily average Federal Funds
Effective Rate or, in the case of C$ Loans, the C$ Prime Rate, for the period
until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the Applicable
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Applicable Administrative Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this subsection
5.9(e) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment
Percentage of such borrowing is not in fact made available to the Applicable
Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing
Date (or three Business Days (Canada) of such Borrowing Date (Canada), as the
case may be), the Applicable Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to
recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to
Alternate Base Rate Loans or C$ Prime Loans, as the case may be, hereunder (in
lieu of any otherwise applicable interest), on demand, from the U.S. Borrower or
the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, without prejudice to any rights which
the U.S. Borrower (or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be) or the
Applicable Administrative Agent may have against such Lender hereunder. Nothing
contained in this subsection 5.9 shall relieve any Lender which has failed to
make available its ratable portion of any borrowing hereunder from its
obligation to do so in accordance with the terms hereof.

          (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by it on any
Borrowing Date (or Borrowing Date (Canada), as the case may be) shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan
on such Borrowing Date (or Borrowing Date (Canada), as the case may be), but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Loan
to be made by such other Lender on such Borrowing Date (or Borrowing Date
(Canada), as the case may be).

          5.10 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if (i)
any Change in Law occurring after the date that any lender becomes a Lender
party to this Agreement, shall make it unlawful for such Lender to make or
maintain Eurodollar Loans

                                       63

<PAGE>

as contemplated by this Agreement, then, unless such Lender is able to make or
maintain such Eurodollar Loans at another branch or office of such Lender
without, in such Lender's sole determination, causing it to suffer any economic,
legal or regulatory disadvantage, the commitment of such Lender hereunder to
make Eurodollar Loans or to convert all or a portion of Alternate Base Rate
Loans into Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be suspended until such time, if
any, as such illegality shall no longer exist and such Lender's Loans then
outstanding as Eurodollar Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to
Alternate Base Rate Loans for the duration of the respective Interest Periods
(or, if permitted by applicable law, at the end of such Interest Periods) and
all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such Eurodollar
Loans shall be applied instead to such Lender's Alternate Base Rate Loans. The
U.S. Borrower hereby agrees to pay any Lender, promptly upon its demand, any
amounts payable pursuant to subsection 5.12 in connection with any conversion in
accordance with this subsection 5.10 (such Lender's notice of such costs, as
certified in reasonable detail as to such amounts to the U.S. Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, to be conclusive absent manifest error).

          5.11 Requirements of Law. (a) In the event that any Change in Law or
compliance by any Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having
the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
occurring after the date that any lender becomes a Lender party to this
Agreement:

               (i) does or shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve,
     special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held
     by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or
     loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds
     by, any office of such Lender which are not otherwise included in the
     determination of the Eurodollar Rate or the rate with respect to C$ Loans,
     as applicable; or

               (ii) does or shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
its Eurodollar Lending Office or Canadian Lending Office of making, converting,
renewing or maintaining advances or extensions of credit or to reduce any amount
receivable hereunder, in each case, in respect of its Eurodollar Loans or C$
Loans, as the case may be, then, in any such case, the U.S. Borrower (or the
Canadian Borrower in the case of C$ Loans) shall pay such Lender, within 10 days
after the U.S. Borrower's receipt of a certificate from such Lender in
accordance with paragraph (f) of this Subsection 5.11, additional amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount
receivable which such Lender deems to be material as determined by such Lender
with respect to such Eurodollar Loans or C$ Loans, as the case may be, together
with interest on each such amount from the date required to be paid until
payment in full thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate in
the case of Eurodollar Loans, and the C$ Prime Rate in the case of C$ Loans,
plus 1%; provided, however, that this subsection 5.11(a) shall not apply with
respect to taxes and amounts relating thereto, which shall be governed solely
and exclusively by subsection 5.11(b).

                                       64

<PAGE>

          (b) In the event that any Change in Law occurring after the date that
any Person becomes a Lender party to this Agreement (or if an Assignee, the date
that the assigning Lender became a party to this Agreement) does or shall
subject any such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office or Canadian Lending
Office to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any
Note, any Eurodollar Loans or any C$ Loans made by it, or change the basis of
taxation of payments to such Lender or its Eurodollar Lending Office or Canadian
Lending Office of principal, the commitment fee, interest or any other amount
payable hereunder (except for (x) net income, franchise or gross receipts taxes
imposed on the net income or gross receipts of such Lender or its Eurodollar
Lending Office or Canadian Lending Office by the jurisdiction under the laws of
which such Lender is organized or carries on business or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or by any jurisdiction in
which such Lender's Eurodollar Lending Office or Canadian Lending Office is
located or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein,
including changes in the rate of tax on the overall net income or gross receipts
of such Lender or such Eurodollar Lending Office or Canadian Lending Office, (y)
taxes resulting from the substitution of any such system by another system of
taxation; provided that the taxes payable by Lenders subject to such other
system of taxation are not generally charged to borrowers from such Lenders
having loans or advances bearing interest at a rate similar to the Eurodollar
Rate and (z) all liabilities, penalties and interest with respect to any of the
foregoing) (all such non-excluded taxes being called "Indemnified Taxes"), all
payments made by the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower under this Agreement
shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of
Indemnified Taxes. If any Indemnified Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amounts payable by the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower to the Applicable
Administrative Agent, or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to it
shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Applicable
Administrative Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Indemnified Taxes)
interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the
amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, an Assignee pursuant to
subsection 12.6(c)(i) shall receive additional amounts only to the extent the
assigning Lender would be entitled under this section. Whenever any Indemnified
Taxes are payable by the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as promptly as
possible thereafter, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may
be, shall send to the Applicable Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, a certified copy of an original official receipt showing payment
thereof. If the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower fails to pay any
Indemnified Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit
to the Applicable Administrative Agent the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case
may be, shall indemnify the Applicable Administrative Agent and the Lenders for
any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by the
Applicable Administrative Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

          (c) In the event that any Change in Law occurring after the date that
any Person becomes a Lender party to this Agreement with respect to any such
Lender shall, in the opinion of such Lender, require that any Commitment of such
Lender be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for purposes of
calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be maintained by such Lender or
any corporation controlling such

                                       65

<PAGE>

Lender, and such Change in Law shall have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's or such corporation's capital, as the case may be, as a
consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder to a level below that which
such Lender or such corporation, as the case may be, could have achieved but for
such Change in Law (taking into account such Lender's or such corporation's
policies, as the case may be, with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time following notice by
such Lender to the Applicable Administrative Agent (which shall in turn
immediately forward such notice to the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower,
as applicable) of such Change in Law as provided in paragraph (c) of this
subsection 5.11, within 15 days after demand by such Lender, the U.S. Borrower
or the Canadian Borrower, as applicable, shall pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such corporation,
as the case may be, on an after-tax basis for such reduction.

          (d) The U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be,
shall not be required to make any payments to any Lender for any additional
amounts pursuant to this subsection 5.11 unless such Lender has given written
notice to the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be,
through the Applicable Administrative Agent, of its intent to request such
payments prior to or within 60 days after the date on which such Lender became
entitled to claim such amounts, which written notice sets forth in reasonable
detail the basis and calculation of such amounts. If any Lender has notified the
U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, through the
Applicable Administrative Agent of any increased costs pursuant to paragraph (a)
or (b) of this subsection 5.11, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as
the case may be, at any time thereafter may, upon at least three Business Days'
notice to the Applicable Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Lenders thereof), and subject to subsection 5.12, prepay (or convert into
Alternate Base Rate Loans in the case of Eurodollar Loans) all (but not a part)
of the Eurodollar Loans or the C$ Loans, as applicable, then outstanding. Each
Lender agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the
operation of paragraph (a) or (b) of this subsection 5.11 with respect to such
Lender, it will, if requested by the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as
applicable, to the extent permitted by law or by the relevant Governmental
Authority and consistent with its internal policies, endeavor in good faith to
avoid or minimize the increase in costs or reduction in payments resulting from
such event (including, without limitation, endeavoring to change its Eurodollar
Lending Office or Canadian Lending Office, as applicable); provided, that such
avoidance or minimization can be made in such a manner that such Lender, in its
sole determination, suffers no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage. If
any Lender requests compensation from the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian
Borrower, as the case may be, under this subsection 5.11, the U.S. Borrower or
the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, may, by notice to such Lender (with a
copy to the Applicable Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such
Lender thereafter to make or continue Loans of the Type with respect to which
such compensation is requested, or to convert Loans of any other Type into Loans
of such Type, until the Requirement of Law giving rise to such request ceases to
be in effect; provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
Lender to receive the compensation so requested.

                                       66

          (e) Each U.S. Lender (and in case of an Assignee on the date it
becomes a U.S. Lender) that is not a United States Person (as defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) for federal income tax purposes either (1) in the case
of a U.S. Lender that is a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
the Code, (i) represents to the U.S. Borrower (for the benefit of the U.S.
Borrower and the Administrative Agent) that under applicable law and treaties no
taxes are required to be withheld by the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative
Agent with respect to any payments to be made to such Lender in respect of the
Loans or the L/C Participating Interests, (ii) agrees to furnish to the U.S.
Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, either U.S. Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") Form W-8ECI (with respect to a complete exemption because the
income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business) or IRS Form
W-8BEN (wherein such Lender claims entitlement to complete exemption from U.S.
Federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder) and (iii) agrees
(for the benefit of the U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent), to the
extent it may lawfully do so at such times, to provide the U.S. Borrower, with a
copy to the Administrative Agent, a new Form W-8ECI (with respect to a complete
exemption because the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or
business) or Form W-8BEN (wherein such Lender claims entitlement to complete
exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax on all interest payments hereunder)
upon the expiration or obsolescence of any previously delivered form and
comparable statements in accordance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations
and amendments duly executed and completed by such Lender, and to comply from
time to time with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations with regard to such
withholding tax exemption or (2) in the case of a U.S. Lender that is not a
"bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (i) agrees to
furnish to the U.S. Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, (A) a
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto (any such certificate,
a "Subsection 5.11(e)(2) Certificate") and (B) two accurate and complete
original signed copies of W-8ECI (with respect to a complete exemption because
the income is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business) or Form
W-8BEN, certifying to such Lender's legal entitlement at the Closing Date (or,
in the case of an Assignee, on the date it becomes a U.S. Lender) to a complete
exemption from U.S. withholding tax under the provisions of Section 881(c) of
the Code with respect to all payments to be made under this Agreement, and (ii)
agrees, to the extent legally entitled to do so, upon reasonable request by the
U.S. Borrower, to provide to the U.S. Borrower (for the benefit of the U.S.
Borrower and the Administrative Agent) such other forms as may be required in
order to establish the legal entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from
withholding with respect to payments under this Agreement. In addition, each
Lender, Issuing Lender, and agent of a Lender or Issuing Lender that is a U.S.
person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes, unless such Person is an exempt recipient within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations (S) 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii), shall deliver to the
U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time(s) and in the manner(s)
specified for delivery of the foregoing IRS forms, two accurate and complete
original signed copies of IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form thereto)
certifying that such Person is exempt from U.S. backup withholding tax on
payments made hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection 5.11
or 5.9(d) to the contrary, the U.S. Borrower shall have no obligation to pay any
amount to or for the account of any U.S.

                                       67

<PAGE>

Lender (or the Eurodollar Lending Office of any U.S. Lender) on account of any
taxes pursuant to this subsection 5.11, to the extent that such amount results
from (i) the failure of any Lender to comply with its obligations pursuant to
this subsection 5.11 or (ii) any representation or warranty made or deemed to be
made by any U.S. Lender pursuant to this subsection 5.11(e) proving to have been
incorrect, false or misleading in any material respect when so made or deemed to
be made.

          (f) If any Lender, Issuing Lender, or agent of a Lender or Issuing
Lender determines in its sole reasonable discretion that it has actually
received any refund of tax in connection with any deduction or withholding or
payment of any additional amount pursuant to this Section 5.11, it shall pay
over such refund to the U.S. Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the U.S. Borrower under this
Section 5.11 with respect to the tax giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Lender and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided, that the U.S. Borrower, upon the request of any Lender,
agrees to repay the amount paid over to the U.S. Borrower (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Lender in the event the Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require any
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to
its taxes which it deems confidential) to the U.S. Borrower or any other Person.

          (g) A certificate in reasonable detail as to any amounts submitted by
such Lender, through the Applicable Administrative Agent, to the U.S. Borrower
or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, shall be conclusive in the absence
of manifest error. The covenants contained in this subsection 5.11 shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and repayment of the Loans.

          5.12 Indemnity. (a) The U.S. Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender
and to hold such Lender harmless from any loss or expense (but without
duplication of any amounts payable as default interest) which such Lender may
sustain or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the U.S. Borrower in payment
of the principal amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loans of such Lender,
including, but not limited to, any such loss or expense arising from interest or
fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make
or maintain its Eurodollar Loans hereunder, (b) default by the U.S. Borrower in
making a borrowing after the U.S. Borrower has given a notice in accordance with
subsection 5.1 or in making a conversion of Alternate Base Rate Loans to
Eurodollar Loans or in continuing Eurodollar Loans as such, in either case,
after the U.S. Borrower has given notice in accordance with subsection 5.2, (c)
default by the U.S. Borrower in making any prepayment after the U.S. Borrower
has given a notice in accordance with subsection 5.4 or (d) a payment or
prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan, any mandatory assignment of a Eurodollar Loan
pursuant to subsection 5.14 or conversion (including without limitation, as a
result of subsection 5.4 and/or a conversion pursuant to subsection 5.10) of any
Eurodollar Loan into an Alternate Base Rate Loan, in any such case on a day
which is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto, including,
but not limited to, any such loss or

                                       68

<PAGE>

expense arising from interest or fees payable by such Lender to lenders of funds
obtained by it in order to maintain its Eurodollar Loans hereunder (but
excluding loss of profit). This covenant shall survive termination of this
Agreement and repayment of the Loans.

          (b) The Canadian Borrower agrees to indemnify each Canadian Lender and
to hold such Lender harmless from any loss or expense (but without duplication
of any amounts payable as default interest) which such Lender may sustain or
incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Canadian Borrower in payment of the
principal amount of or interest on any C$ Loans, including, but not limited to,
any such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by such Lender to
lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain C$ Loans hereunder,
(b) default by the Canadian Borrower in making a borrowing after the Canadian
Borrower has given a notice in accordance with subsection 4.2 or 4.3 or in
making a conversion of C$ Loans after the Canadian Borrower has given notice in
accordance with subsection 4.4 or (c) default by the Canadian Borrower in making
any prepayment after the Canadian Borrower has given a notice in accordance with
subsection 5.4(d). This covenant shall survive termination of this Agreement and
repayment of the Loans.

          5.13 Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The U.S. Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each applicable Lender (i) the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Credit Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Credit Termination Date,
(ii) the principal amount of the Term Loans of such Lender payable on each
Installment Payment Date, in accordance with subsection 5.4(c) (or the then
unpaid principal amount of such Term Loans on the date that the Term Loans
become due and payable pursuant to Section 10), and (iii) the then unpaid
principal amount of the Swing Line Loans of the Swing Line Lender on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date. The U.S. Borrower hereby further agrees to
pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of the U.S. Loans from time to time
outstanding from the date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per
annum and on the dates set forth in subsection 5.5.

          (b) The Canadian Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to
the Canadian Administrative Agent for the account of each Canadian Lender on the
Revolving Credit Termination Date the then unpaid principal amount of each C$
Loan. The Canadian Borrower hereby further agrees to pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of the C$ Prime Loans from time to time outstanding from the
date hereof until payment in full thereof at the rates per annum and on the
dates set forth in subsection 5.5.

          (c) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice
an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the U.S. Borrower and the
Canadian Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from
time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

          (d) The Administrative Agents shall, on behalf of the Lenders and for
the benefit of the Borrowing Parties, maintain the Registers pursuant to
subsection 12.6(d), and a subaccount therein for each Lender, in which shall be
recorded (i) the

                                       69

<PAGE>

Commitment of each Lender and the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type
thereof and each Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) whether such Loan has
been made to the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, (iii) any Note
evidencing such Loan, (iv) the amount of any principal or interest due and
payable or to become due and payable from the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian
Borrower, as the case may be, to each Lender hereunder and (v) both the amount
of any sum received by the Applicable Administrative Agent hereunder from the
U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, and each Lender's
share thereof.

          (e) The entries made in the Registers and the accounts of each Lender
maintained pursuant to subsection 5.13(c) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the
obligations of the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be,
therein recorded; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Applicable
Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error
therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the U.S. Borrower or
the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, to repay (with applicable interest)
the Loans made to the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may
be, by such Lender or to repay any other obligations in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

          (f) (i) The U.S. Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the
Applicable Administrative Agent by any Lender, the U.S. Borrower will execute
and deliver to such Lender (A) a promissory note of the U.S. Borrower evidencing
the Revolving Credit Loans of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit
A with appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a "Revolving
Credit Note"), (B) a promissory note of the U.S. Borrower evidencing the Closing
Date Term Loan of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 with
appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a "Closing Date Term
Note"), (C) a promissory note of the U.S. Borrower evidencing the Change of
Control Term Loan of such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 with

and principal amount (the "Swing Line Note"); and

               (ii) The Canadian Borrower agrees that, upon the request to the
     Canadian Administrative Agent by any Canadian Lender, the Canadian Borrower
     will execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Canadian

     substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2 with appropriate insertions as to
     date and principal amount (a "C$ Note").

          5.14 Replacement of Lenders. In the event any Lender or the Issuing
Lender is (a) a Non-Funding Lender, (b) is a Non-Consenting Lender, (c)
exercises its rights pursuant to subsection 5.10 or (d) requests payments
pursuant to subsections 3.10 or 5.11, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian
Borrower, as the case may be may require, at its own expense (including payment
of any processing fees under subsection 12.6(e)) and

                                       70

<PAGE>

subject to subsection 5.12, such Lender or the Issuing Lender to assign, at par
plus accrued interest and fees, without recourse (in accordance with subsection
12.6) all of its interests, rights and obligations hereunder (including all of
its Commitments and the Loans and other amounts at the time owing to it
hereunder and its Notes and its interest in the Letters of Credit, if
applicable) to a bank, financial institution or other entity specified by the
U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be; provided that (i)
such assignment shall not conflict with or violate any law, rule or regulation
or order of any court or other Governmental Authority, (ii) the U.S. Borrower or
the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, shall have received the written
consent of the Applicable Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed, to such assignment, (iii) the U.S. Borrower
or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, shall have paid to the assigning
Lender or the Issuing Lender all monies other than principal, interest and fees
accrued and owing hereunder to it (including pursuant to subsections 3.10, 5.10,
5.11 and 5.12) and (iv) in the case of a required assignment by the Issuing
Lender, the Letters of Credit shall be canceled and returned to the Issuing
Lender. For purposes of this subsection 5.14, the term "Non-Consenting Lender"
means, in the event that (i) the U.S. Borrower or the Administrative Agent has
requested the Lenders to consent to a departure or waiver of any provisions of
the Credit Documents or to agree to any amendment thereto, (ii) the consent,
waiver or amendment in question requires the consent of each affected Lender in
accordance with the terms of subsection 12.1 or all the Lenders with respect to
a certain class of the Loans and (iii) the Required Lenders or more than 50% of
the class of such Lenders have agreed to such consent, waiver or amendment, any
Lender who does not agree to such consent, waiver or amendment.

          5.15 Reliance on Representation of the U.S. Borrower. Each of the U.S.
Borrower and the Canadian Borrower hereby agrees that the Administrative Agents
and the Lenders may rely on any representation, warranty, certificate, notice,
document or telephone request which purports to be executed or made, and which
the Applicable Administrative Agent or the Lenders, as the case may be, in good
faith believe to have been executed or made, by the U.S. Borrower or the
Canadian Borrower or any of their respective authorized officers, and (i) the
U.S. Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify and hold each of the
Administrative Agents and the Lenders harmless for any action, including the
making of the borrowings hereunder, and any loss or expense, taken or incurred
by any of them as a result of their good faith reliance upon any such
representations, warranty, certificate, notice, document or telephone request
made by the U.S. Borrower or to which the U.S. Borrower is a party and (ii) the
Canadian Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of
the Administrative Agents and the Lenders for any action, including the making
of the borrowings hereunder, and any loss or expense, taken or incurred by any
of them as a result of their good faith reliance on upon any representation,
warranty, certificate, notice, documents or telephonic request made by the
Canadian Borrower or to which the Canadian Borrower is a party.

          SECTION 6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

          In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to
make the Loans and to induce the Issuing Lender to issue, and the Participating
Lenders to

                                       71

<PAGE>

participate in, the Letters of Credit, the U.S. Borrower hereby represents and
warrants to each Lender and each of the Administrative Agents as of the Closing
Date and as of the making of any extension of credit hereunder (other than with
respect to any borrowing of the Change of Control Term Loans):

          6.1 Financial Condition. (a) The U.S. Borrower has heretofore
furnished to the Lenders (i) the audited consolidated balance sheets of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 28, 2002 and December
29, 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three Fiscal Years in the period ended on
December 28, 2002, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from
Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet
and related statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for each Fiscal Quarter
subsequent to December 28, 2002 ended 45 days before the Closing Date, certified
by a Responsible Officer of the Company. Such financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition and results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as at
such dates and for such periods. Such balance sheets and the notes thereto
disclose all material liabilities, direct or contingent, of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof. All such financial
statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods
involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants and
disclosed therein and that the unaudited financial statements do not contain
notes thereto).

          (b) The forecasts, pro forma financial information and financial
projections contained in the Confidential Information Memorandum are based on
the good faith assumptions of management of the Company and its subsidiaries,
which assumptions are believed by such management to be reasonable at the time
made; it being understood that such forecasts, information and projections do
not address the impact of any purchase accounting treatment required by GAAP as
a result of the Merger.

          6.2 No Material Adverse Change. Since December 28, 2002, there has
been no change, development or event which has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the U.S. Borrower
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          6.3 Existence; Compliance with Law. Each of Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, (b) is in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation (to the extent such concept
is recognized in such jurisdiction) and has full power and authority and
possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations and
approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted, other than any
such failures to be in good standing or such franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations and approvals the lack of which, individually or in the

                                       72

<PAGE>

aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
(c) is duly qualified and in good standing (to the extent such concept is
applicable in the applicable jurisdiction) to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or holding of its
properties makes such qualification necessary, except such jurisdictions where
the failure so to qualify would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with all applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, orders, permits and regulations of any Governmental Authority
or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, except where noncompliance would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.4 Power; Authorization. Each of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries has the power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
each of the Credit Documents to which it is a party, and each of the U.S.
Borrower and the Canadian Borrower has the power and authority and legal right
to borrow hereunder and, in the case of the U.S. Borrower only, to have Letters
of Credit issued for its account hereunder. Each of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries has taken all necessary action to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of each of the Credit Documents to which it
is or will be a party and each of the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower
has taken all necessary action to authorize the borrowings hereunder and, in the
case of the U.S. Borrower only, the issuance of Letters of Credit for its
account hereunder. No consent or authorization of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or
performance by Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or for
the validity or enforceability in accordance with its terms against Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, of any Credit Document except for
(i) such consents, authorizations and filings which have been obtained or made
and are in full force and effect, (ii) such consents, authorizations and
filings, the failure to obtain or perform which would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) such filings as are necessary to
perfect the Liens of the Lenders created pursuant to this Agreement and the
Security Documents.

          6.5 Enforceable Obligations. This Agreement has been, and each of the
other Credit Documents has been or will be, duly executed and delivered on
behalf of each Credit Party that is party thereto. This Agreement constitutes,
and each of the other Credit Documents constitute, the legal, valid and binding
obligation of each Credit Party that is party thereto, and is enforceable
against each Credit Party that is party thereto in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law).

          6.6 No Legal Bar. The execution, delivery and performance of each
Credit Document, the incurrence or issuance of and use of the proceeds of the
Loans and of drawings under the Letters of Credit and the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Documents, (a) will not violate any Requirement of
Law or any Contractual Obligation applicable to or binding upon any of Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets, in any manner which, individually or in the

                                       73

<PAGE>

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and
(b) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the
properties or assets of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant
to any Requirement of Law applicable to it, as the case may be, or any of its
Contractual Obligations, except for the Liens arising under the Security
Documents and Permitted Liens.

          6.7 No Material Litigation. Other than as set forth on Schedule 6.7,
(i) no litigation by, investigation known to the U.S. Borrower by, or proceeding
of, any Governmental Authority is pending against Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries (including after giving effect to the Transactions) with
respect to the Transactions or the validity, binding effect or enforceability of
any Credit Document, the Loans made hereunder, the use of proceeds thereof, or
of any drawings under a Letter of Credit and (ii) no lawsuits, claims,
proceedings or investigations are pending or, to the knowledge of the U.S.
Borrower, threatened against or affecting Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, assets, operations or
businesses (including after giving effect to the Transactions), which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          6.8 Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act. None
of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment
company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" (as each of the
quoted terms is defined or used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended) or (b) a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
as amended.

          6.9 Federal Reserve Regulation. No part of the proceeds of any of the
Loans or any drawing under a Letter of Credit will be used for any purpose which
violates the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board. None of Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is engaged or will engage,
principally or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose of "purchasing" or "carrying" any "margin stock" within
the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms under said Regulation U.

          6.10 No Default. Each of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries has performed all material obligations required to be performed by
it under its Contractual Obligations (including after giving effect to the
Transactions) and none of them is (with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice, or both) in breach or default in any respect thereunder, except to the
extent that such failure to perform, breach or default would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. None of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries (including after giving effect to the Transactions)
is in default under any judgment, order or decree of any Governmental Authority,
domestic or foreign, applicable to it or any of its properties, assets,
operations or business, except to the extent that any such defaults would not,
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       74

<PAGE>

          6.11 Taxes. Each of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has filed or caused to be filed all material tax returns required to have been
filed (taking into account applicable extension periods) by it and has paid all
taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any assessments made
against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or other charges
imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority, other than
any such taxes, fees or charges (a) the amount or validity of which is currently
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to
which reserves (or other sufficient provisions) in conformity with GAAP have
been provided on the books of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
the case may be or (b) the failure of which to so pay would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          6.12 Subsidiaries. The Subsidiaries of the U.S. Borrower and their
jurisdictions of incorporation and the percentage ownership interest of the U.S.
Borrower therein on the Closing Date are as set forth on Schedule 6.12. The
shares of Capital Stock of the Subsidiaries so indicated on Schedule 6.12 are
owned by the U.S. Borrower, directly or indirectly, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Liens created under the Security Documents).

          6.13 Ownership of Property; Liens. Each of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries, has good and valid title to all of its material
assets (other than real property or interests in real property) in each case
free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever except Permitted Liens.
With respect to real property or interests in real property, as of the Closing
Date each of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has (i)
fee title to all of the real property listed (together with the address thereof)
on Schedule 6.13 under the heading "Fee Properties" (each, a "Fee Property") and
(ii) good and valid title to the leasehold estates in all of the real property
leased by it and, in the case of any such leasehold estates located in the
United States with a base aggregate annual rent in excess of $50,000, listed
(together with the address thereof) on Schedule 6.13 under the heading "Leased
Properties" (each, a "Leased Property"), in each case, free and clear of all
Liens of any nature whatsoever, except (A) Permitted Liens and (B) as to Leased
Property, the terms and provisions of the respective lease therefor and any
matters affecting the fee title and any estate superior to the leasehold estate
related thereto, none of which interfere in any material respect with the
ability of the lessee of such Leased Property to utilize such Leased Property
for its intended purposes.

          6.14 ERISA. Neither a Reportable Event nor an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the date on which this
representation is made or deemed made with respect to any Plan that would result
in a material liability to the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and
each Plan has complied during such period in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code. Neither the U.S. Borrower nor any
Commonly Controlled Entity has been involved in any transaction that would cause
the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to be subject to material liability
with respect to a Plan to which the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Commonly Controlled Entity contributed or was obligated to

                                       75

<PAGE>

contribute during the six-year period ending on the date this representation is
made or deemed made; or incurred any material liability under Title IV of ERISA
which would become or remain a material liability of the U.S. Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. No termination of a Single Employer
Plan has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during
such five-year period ending on the date this representation is made or deemed
made that would result in a material liability to the U.S. Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Single
Employer Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as
of the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation
is made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to
such accrued benefits by an amount that would result in a material liability to
the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the U.S. Borrower, nor any
of its Subsidiaries nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a complete or
partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan, and neither the U.S. Borrower,
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any Commonly Controlled Entity would become
subject to any liability under ERISA if the U.S. Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or any such Commonly Controlled Entity were to withdraw completely
from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding the
date on which this representation is made or deemed made, in either case that
would result in a material liability to the U.S. Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the U.S. Borrower, no such Multiemployer Plan
is in Reorganization or Insolvent. The present value (determined using actuarial
and other assumptions which are reasonable in respect of the benefits provided
and the employees participating) of the liability of the U.S. Borrower, its
Subsidiaries and each Commonly Controlled Entity for post retirement benefits to
be provided to their current and former employees under Plans which are welfare
benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) does not, in the aggregate,
exceed the assets under all such Plans allocable to such benefits by an amount
that would result in a material liability to the U.S. Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries except as disclosed in the audited financial statements of the U.S.
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries provided to the Lenders prior to the
Closing Date. For purposes of this subsection 6.14, a material liability means a
liability that would have a Material Adverse Effect.

to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Lenders, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the pledged stock
described therein (to the extent such matter is governed by the law of the
United States or a jurisdiction therein) and, when stock certificates

title and interest of the pledgor party thereto in the pledged stock described

or a jurisdiction therein).

          (b) Each of the Collateral Agreement and the Canadian Collateral

each of the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 6.15(b), or arrangements have been
made for such filing in such jurisdictions, and upon such filing, and upon the
taking of possession of, or obtaining control over, by the Applicable
Administrative Agent of any such collateral the security interests in which may
be perfected only by possession or by obtaining control, such security interests
will, subject to the existence of Permitted Liens, constitute perfected first
priority liens on, and security interests in, all right, title and interest of
the debtor party thereto in the collateral described therein, except to the
extent that a security interest cannot be perfected therein by the filing of a
financing statement or the taking of possession or by obtaining control under
the Uniform Commercial Code or PPSA, as applicable, of the relevant
jurisdiction.

interest in the collateral described therein, and upon recording the Mortgages
in the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 6.13 (or, in the case of a Mortgage
delivered pursuant to subsection 8.9, the jurisdiction in which the property
covered by such Mortgage is located), such security interests will, subject to
the existence of Permitted Liens, constitute first liens on, and perfected
security interests in, all right, title and interest of the debtor party thereto
in the collateral described therein.

Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, outstanding under any Environmental Law.

          6.18 Accuracy and Completeness of Information. The factual statements
contained in any certificates or documents furnished or to be furnished to the
Applicable Administrative Agent or the Lenders from time to time in connection
with this Agreement, taken as a whole, do not and will not, to the knowledge of
the U.S. Borrower, as of the date when made, contain any untrue statement of a

such noncompliance, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall promptly
undertake reasonable efforts to achieve compliance or to contest by appropriate
proceedings any alleged noncompliance and provided that, in any case, such
noncompliance, and any other noncompliance with Environmental Law and any

benefit of the Lenders, a new pledge agreement or such amendments to the
relevant Security Agreement as the Administrative Agent reasonably shall deem

the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) deliver to the Administrative
Agent the certificates, if any, representing such Capital Stock, together with

an assumption agreement, substantially in the form annexed to the Collateral
Agreement, that results in such Subsidiary becoming a party to the Subsidiary
Guarantee and the Collateral Agreement (or such comparable documentation which
is in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent),
and (B) to take all actions necessary or advisable to cause the Lien created by
the Collateral Agreement to be duly perfected to the extent required by such
agreement in accordance with all applicable Requirements of Law, including,
without limitation, the filing of financing statements in such jurisdictions as

amendments to the relevant Security Agreement as the Administrative Agent
reasonably shall deem necessary or advisable to grant to the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, a Lien on the Capital Stock of such

(provided that in no event shall more than 65% of the Capital Stock of any such
Foreign Subsidiary be required to be so pledged), and (ii) if such Capital Stock
is issued in certificated form, deliver to the Administrative Agent any
certificates representing such Capital Stock, together with undated stock powers
executed and delivered in blank by a duly authorized officer of the U.S.
Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and take or cause to be taken
all such other actions under the law of the jurisdiction of organization of such
Foreign Subsidiary as may be necessary or advisable to perfect such Lien on such
Capital Stock, and if reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, deliver
to the Administrative Agent legal opinions relating to the matters described in

Agent, within 60 days of such request, security interests and Mortgages in such
owned real property of the U.S. Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries as are
acquired after the Closing Date by the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary and
that, together with any improvements thereon, individually have a value of at
least $5,000,000 (based on the purchase price thereof if such real estate is the
only asset being purchased in such transaction, otherwise the determination of
value shall be made by the U.S. Borrower in good faith), as additional security
for the obligations of the Credit Parties under any Credit Document (unless the
subject property is already mortgaged to a third party to the extent permitted
by subsection 9.2). Such Mortgages shall be granted pursuant to documentation
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Administrative Agent and
shall constitute valid and enforceable perfected Liens subject only to Permitted
Liens and such other Liens reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.
The Mortgages or instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in
such manner and in such places as are required by law to establish, perfect,
preserve and protect the Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent required to
be granted pursuant to the Mortgages and all taxes, fees and other charges
payable in connection therewith shall be paid by the U.S. Borrower in full. If
requested by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, the U.S. Borrower
shall provide a lender's title policy with respect to each such Mortgage paid
for by the U.S. Borrower, issued by a nationally recognized title insurance
company, together with such endorsements, coinsurance and reinsurance as may be
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, insuring each Mortgage as a
first lien on the relevant Mortgaged Property and subject only to Liens
expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent.

          (e) With respect to any Person that is or becomes a Canadian
Subsidiary that has material assets, promptly (and in any event within 30 days
after such Person becomes a Canadian Subsidiary), execute and deliver to the

results in such Person becoming a party to (i) the Canadian Subsidiary Guarantee
and (ii) the Canadian Collateral Agreement.

          (f) The U.S. Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent reasonable
advance notice prior to entering into any Specified Sale-Leaseback Transaction
and, if the property to be subject thereto, together with any improvements
thereon, has a value of at least $5,000,000 (based on the proposed sale price
thereof), (i) the form of lease relating thereto shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of the Administrative Agent and (ii) upon consummation of
such Specified Sale-Leaseback Transaction, the U.S. Borrower shall grant, or
cause the applicable Subsidiary to grant, to the Administrative Agent a
leasehold Mortgage in the property subject thereto, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

          (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Security
Document to the contrary, (i) in no event shall Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or
any Subsidiary be required to comply with the provisions of paragraphs (c), (d)
or (f) of this subsection 8.9 with respect to any asset as to which the
Administrative Agent, upon the

                                       91

<PAGE>

request of the U.S. Borrower, shall determine in its reasonable discretion that
the costs of obtaining a security interest in such asset are excessive in
relation to the benefit to the Lenders of the security afforded thereby and (ii)
neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to grant
to the Administrative Agent any Mortgage in respect of any real property listed
on Schedule 1.1(a); provided, however, that if any such real property is owned
in fee by the U.S. Borrower or a Subsidiary on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary shall comply with the
provisions of paragraph (d) of this subsection 8.9 with respect to such real
property (without giving effect to any dollar thresholds contained therein, but
subject to clause (i) of this subsection 8.9(g)) within 30 days after such
anniversary.

          8.10 Change of Control Offers. Within three Business Days following
the Closing Date, the U.S. Borrower shall mail the Change of Control Offers to

Existing Indenture and the Certificate of Designation, respectively.

or any Subsidiary (x) incurred in the ordinary course of business (provided
that, any such payment by Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary of

advanced by such Person on the security of such property or rental obligations
of the U.S. Borrower or such Subsidiary (a "Sale-Leaseback Transaction"),
provided that this subsection 9.17 shall not prohibit any Sale-Leaseback

transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
involving any Plan, (ii) any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in
Section 302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, shall exist with respect to any
Plan or any Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan shall arise on the assets of the
U.S. Borrower or any Commonly Controlled Entity, (iii) a Reportable Event shall
occur with respect to, or proceedings shall commence to have a trustee

ERISA, or (v) the U.S. Borrower or any Commonly Controlled Entity shall, or in
the reasonable opinion of the Required Lenders is likely to, incur any liability

          (h) One or more judgments or decrees shall be entered against

                                      114

<PAGE>

then, and in any such event, (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified
in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (f) above with respect to Holdings or the
U.S. Borrower, automatically (i) the Commitments shall immediately terminate and
the Loans hereunder (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing

(ii) all obligations of the U.S. Borrower in respect of the Letters of Credit,
although contingent and unmatured, shall become immediately due and payable and
the Issuing Lender's obligations to issue the Letters of Credit shall
immediately terminate and (b) if such event is any other Event of Default, so
long as any such Event of Default shall be continuing, either or both of the
following actions may be taken: (i) with the consent of the Required Lenders,
the Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the U.S. Borrower, declare the
Commitments and the Issuing Lender's obligations to issue the Letters of Credit
to be terminated forthwith, whereupon the Commitments and such obligations shall
immediately terminate; and (ii) with the consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent shall, by notice of default to the U.S. Borrower, (A)
declare all or a portion of the Loans hereunder (with accrued interest thereon)
and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the Notes to be due and
payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable,
and (B) declare all or a portion of the obligations of the U.S. Borrower in
respect of the Letters of Credit, although contingent and unmatured, to be due
and payable forthwith, whereupon the same shall immediately become due and
payable and/or demand that the U.S. Borrower discharge any or all of the
obligations supported by the Letters of Credit by paying or prepaying any amount
due or to become due in respect of such obligations. All payments under this
Section 10 on account of undrawn Letters of Credit shall be made by the U.S.
Borrower directly to a cash collateral account established by the Administrative
Agent for such purpose for application to the U.S. Borrower's reimbursement
obligations under subsection 3.8 as drafts are presented under the Letters of
Credit, with the balance, if any, to be applied to the U.S. Borrower's
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes as the Administrative Agent shall
determine with the approval of the Required Lenders. Except as expressly
provided above in this Section 10, presentment, demand, protest and all other
notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived.

          SECTION 11. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS; THE ISSUING LENDER

          11.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints CSFB as the Administrative Agent and Credit Suisse First Boston Toronto
Branch as the Canadian Administrative Agent under this Agreement and irrevocably
authorizes CSFB as Administrative Agent or Credit Suisse First Boston Toronto
Branch as Canadian Administrative Agent, as applicable, for such Lender to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Credit Documents and to
exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the
Applicable Administrative Agent by the terms of the Credit Documents, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, including, without
limitation, in the case of the Administrative Agent, entering into the
Intercreditor Agreement with The Bank of Nova Scotia in substantially

                                      115

<PAGE>

the form of Exhibit R. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere
in this Agreement, the Administrative Agents shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into the
Credit Documents or otherwise exist against either of the Administrative Agents.

          11.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agents may execute any
of their respective duties under this Agreement and each of the other Credit
Documents by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. Neither
Administrative Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of
any agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care, except as
otherwise provided in subsection 11.3.

          11.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither of the Administrative Agents, nor
any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully
taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with
the Credit Documents (except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or
willful misconduct, as determined in the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction), or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Credit Party or
any officer thereof contained in the Credit Documents or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Applicable Administrative Agent under or in connection with, the Credit
Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of the Credit Documents or for any failure of any Credit Party to
perform its obligations thereunder. Neither of the Administrative Agents shall
be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, any Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any
Credit Party.

          11.4 Reliance by Administrative Agents. Each Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
Note, entries maintained in the Registers, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to any Borrowing Party), independent accountants and other
experts selected by either of the Administrative Agents. Each Administrative
Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Applicable Administrative Agent. Each
Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under any Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, where a higher percentage of the
Lenders is expressly required hereunder, such Lenders) as it deems appropriate
or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any
and all liability and expense which may be

                                      116

<PAGE>

incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The
Administrative Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under any Credit Document in accordance with a request
of the Required Lenders (unless a higher percentage of Lenders is expressly
required), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the
Notes.

          11.5 Notice of Default. Neither of the Administrative Agents shall be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default hereunder unless such Administrative Agent has received written notice
from a Lender or the U.S. Borrower or any other Credit Party referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". In the event that either of the Administrative
Agents receives such a notice, such Administrative Agent shall promptly give
notice thereof to the other Administrative Agent and to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agents shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders;
provided that unless and until the Administrative Agents shall have received
such directions, the Administrative Agents may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default or Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of
the Lenders.

          11.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender expressly acknowledges that neither of the Administrative Agents nor any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
either of the Administrative Agents hereafter taken, including any review of the
affairs of the Credit Parties, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by such Administrative Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents
to the Administrative Agents that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agents or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter
into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agents or any other Lender, and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under the Credit Documents, and to make such investigation as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower and its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents
expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Applicable
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agents shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Credit Parties which may come into the
possession of the Administrative Agents or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

                                      117

<PAGE>

          11.7 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify each of the
Administrative Agents in its capacity as such (in each case to the extent not
reimbursed by the Credit Parties and without limiting the obligation of the
Credit Parties to do so), ratably according to the respective amounts of their
respective Commitments (or, to the extent such Commitments have been terminated,
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans, Bankers'
Acceptances and the L/C Obligations and the respective obligations, whether as
Issuing Lender or a Participating Lender, under the Letters of Credit), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind
whatsoever which may at any time (including without limitation at any time
following the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against either of the Administrative Agents, as applicable, in any way relating
to or arising out of the Credit Documents or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken
or omitted by either of the Administrative Agents, as applicable, under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall be liable
for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting solely from the Applicable Administrative Agent's gross negligence or
willful misconduct, as determined in the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The agreements in this subsection 11.7 shall survive the repayment
of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

          11.8 The Administrative Agents in their Individual Capacities. Each of
the Administrative Agents and their respective Affiliates may make loans to,
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries as though such Administrative Agent were
not an Administrative Agent hereunder. With respect to its Loans made or renewed
by it and any Note issued to it, each Administrative Agent shall have the same
rights and powers, duties and liabilities under the Credit Documents as any
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Administrative Agent
and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative Agents in
their respective individual capacities.

          11.9 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders, and the
Administrative Agent may be removed as Administrative Agent by the U.S. Borrower
upon 30 days' notice to the Administrative Agent. If the Administrative Agent
shall so resign or be so removed as Administrative Agent under the Credit
Documents, then, (i) if Deutsche Bank AG or one of its Affiliates is a Lender
hereunder at such time and it accepts such appointment in its sole discretion,
Deutsche Bank AG (acting through a branch to be determined by it) shall become
the successor Administrative Agent for the Lenders or (ii) if neither Deutsche
Bank AG nor any of its Affiliates is a Lender hereunder at such time or Deutsche
Bank AG is unwilling to accept such appointment as successor Administrative
Agent, then the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor agent for the Lenders which successor agent shall, so long as no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, be approved by the U.S. Borrower,
which shall not unreasonably withhold its approval, whereupon, in either such
case, such

                                      118

<PAGE>

successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Notes. After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Section 11 shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
the Administrative Agent under the Credit Documents. The provisions of this
subsection 11.9 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the resignation and removal of
the Canadian Administrative Agent.

          11.10 Issuing Lender as Issuer of Letters of Credit. Each U.S.
Revolving Credit Lender hereby acknowledges that the provisions of this Section
11 shall apply to the Issuing Lender, in its capacity as issuer of the Letters
of Credit, in the same manner as such provisions are expressly stated to apply
to the Administrative Agent, except that obligations to indemnify the Issuing
Lender shall be ratable among the U.S. Revolving Credit Lenders in accordance
with their respective U.S. Revolving Credit Commitments (or, if the U.S.
Revolving Credit Commitments have been terminated, the outstanding principal
amount of their respective U.S. Revolving Credit Loans and L/C Obligations and
their respective participating interests in the outstanding Letters of Credit).

          11.11 Administrative Agent as Joint and Several Creditor. Solely for
purposes of the pledge of shares of Jostens Can Investments B.V., a Netherlands
corporation and Jostens International Holdings B.V., a Netherlands corporation,
the U.S. Borrower and each Lender agree that the Administrative Agent shall be
the joint and several creditor (together with the relevant Lenders) of each
obligation of the U.S. Borrower towards each Lender under the Credit Documents,
and that accordingly, the Administrative Agent will have its own independent
right to demand performance by the U.S. Borrower of those obligations. However,
(i) any discharge of any such obligation to one of the Administrative Agent or a
Lender shall, to the same extent, discharge the corresponding obligation owing
to the other, and (ii) a Lender and the Administrative Agent shall not, by
virtue of this subsection 11.11, be entitled to pursue the U.S. Borrower
concurrently for the same obligation.

          SECTION 12. MISCELLANEOUS

          12.1 Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, no Credit Document nor any terms thereof may be amended,
supplemented, waived or modified except in accordance with the provisions of
this subsection 12.1. With the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the respective Credit Parties may, from time to time,
enter into written amendments, supplements or modifications hereto or to any
other Credit Document for the purpose of adding any provisions to any Credit
Document to which they are parties or changing in any manner the rights of the
Lenders or of any such Credit Party thereunder or waiving, on such terms and
conditions as the Administrative Agent may specify in

                                      119

Collateral released pursuant to this clause (a) (ii) (other than Collateral
released pursuant to the proviso to this clause (a)) during the calendar year in

calendar year, has fair market value on the proposed date of release in excess
of 20% of the fair market value of all Collateral (including any Guarantee) on
such date without the written consent of the Supermajority Lenders; provided

and no consent shall be required for (i) releases of Collateral in connection
with any dispositions permitted by subsection 9.5, (ii) releases of Collateral
in accordance with subsection 12.11 or (iii) upon the reincorporation of
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any Subsidiary in a new jurisdiction or the
creation of a new Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower, any release of Collateral in
connection with the transfer of such released Collateral to such reincorporated
entity or new Subsidiary in compliance with subsection 9.4; provided that the
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that such release and
transfer, together with any grant and perfection of a new Lien therein in favor
of the Administrative Agent, will cause no material impairment of the value of
the Collateral taken as a whole, after giving effect to such release and
transfer;

          (b) except as provided in subsection 12.1(d), no such waiver and no
such amendment, supplement or modification shall extend the final maturity date

any installment of any Loan, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest thereon (it being understood and agreed that neither changes to the
definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Indebtedness or Leverage Ratio
(or any other component definition of any of the foregoing) nor the election not
to impose (or once imposed, an election to rescind) the default rate of interest
provided for in the Credit Documents shall be (or be deemed to be) a reduction
in the rate of interest payable hereunder for the purposes of this subsection
12.1(b)), or reduce or extend the time of payment of any fee payable to the
Lenders hereunder, or reduce the principal amount of any Loan, or change the
amount of any Lender's Commitment or Commitment Percentage, or require any
Lender to offer Interest Periods of greater than six months, in each case,
without the prior written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;

          (c) no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification
affecting the then Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent or

Commitments or, if the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated, the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans (the Term Loans
and the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Non-Funding Lender to be disregarded
in determining such percentage at any time);

          (f) no such waiver and no such amendment, supplement or modification
shall amend, modify or waive any provision of subsection 5.9(a) or (b) or this
subsection 12.1 or reduce the percentage specified in (or otherwise modify) the
definition of Required Lenders or Supermajority Lenders or consent to the
assignment or transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations
under any Credit Agreement, in each case without the prior written consent of
each Lender;

any such waiver and any such amendment, supplement or modification described in
this subsection 12.1 shall apply equally to each of the Lenders and shall be
binding upon each Credit Party and its Subsidiaries, the Lenders, the
Administrative Agents and the Issuing Lender and all future holders of the Notes
and the Loans. Any extension of a Letter of Credit by the Issuing Lender shall
be treated hereunder as a new Letter of Credit. In the case of any waiver, the
Credit Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative Agents and Issuing Lender shall
be restored to their former position and rights hereunder and under the
outstanding Notes, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed to
be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent thereon.

          12.2 Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
respective parties hereto to be effective shall be in writing (including by

provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon the Administrative Agent,
the Canadian Administrative Agent or the Lenders pursuant to subsections 3.4,

further, that the failure to provide the copies of notices to the U.S. Borrower

in any liability to either of the Administrative Agents.

          12.3 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of either of the Administrative Agents or any
Lender, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,

the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

          12.4 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties made hereunder and in any document, certificate or statement
delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the execution

          12.5 Payment of Expenses and Taxes. The U.S. Borrower agrees (a) to
pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Canadian
Administrative Agent for all their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, negotiation, preparation and
execution of the Credit Documents and any other documents prepared in connection
herewith, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of
one counsel to the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Canadian
Administrative Agent in each relevant jurisdiction (all of the foregoing being
subject in the case of the Arrangers to the terms of the Assignment Letter
Agreement dated as of July 3, 2003, among CSFB, Credit Suisse First Boston LLC,
Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and the
U.S. Borrower), (b) to pay or reimburse all of the reasonable expenses,
including without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, incurred
by the Administrative Agent and the Canadian Administrative Agent in connection
with the administration of the facilities provided for herein or in connection
with any amendments, waivers, work-outs or restructurings in respect thereof,
(c) to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and each Lender for all their costs and
expenses incurred in connection with, and to pay, indemnify, and hold the
Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Lender and each Lender harmless from and against any and all other
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of
or in connection with, the enforcement or preservation of any rights under any
Credit Document and any such other documents, including, without

                                      123

<PAGE>

limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel in each relevant
jurisdiction to the Administrative Agent incurred in connection with the
foregoing and in connection with advising the Administrative Agent with respect
to its rights and responsibilities under this Agreement and the documentation
relating thereto, and, at any time after and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, one counsel in each relevant jurisdiction to the Lenders, (d) to
pay, indemnify, and to hold each Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and each
Lender harmless from any and all recording and filing fees and any and all
liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay (other than to the
extent attributable to such Administrative Agent, Arranger or Lender) in paying,
stamp, excise and other similar taxes (other than withholding taxes), if any,
which may be payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution and delivery of, or consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by, or any amendment, supplement or modification of, or any waiver
or consent under or in respect of, any Credit Document and any such other
documents, and (e) to pay, indemnify, and hold the Administrative Agent, the
Arrangers, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and each Lender
and their respective Affiliates, officers, directors and trustees harmless from
and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) which may be incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Lender or the Lenders or such Affiliates, officers, directors or
trustees (x) arising out of or in connection with any investigation, litigation
or proceeding related to this Agreement, the other Credit Documents, the
proceeds of the Loans and the transactions contemplated by or in respect of such
use of proceeds, or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, whether
or not the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lender or any of the Lenders or such Affiliates, officers,
directors or trustees is a party thereto, including, without limitation, any of
the foregoing relating to the violation of, noncompliance with or liability
under, any Environmental Law applicable to Holdings, the U.S. Borrower, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the facilities and properties owned, leased or
operated by Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (y)
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by reason of or in connection
with the execution and delivery or transfer of, or payment or failure to make
payments under, Letters of Credit (it being agreed that nothing in this
subsection 12.5(d)(y) is intended to limit the U.S. Borrower's obligations
pursuant to subsection 3.8) (all the foregoing, collectively, the "indemnified
liabilities"); provided that the U.S. Borrower shall have no obligation
hereunder with respect to indemnified liabilities of the Administrative Agent,
the Arrangers, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any
Lender or any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors and trustees
arising from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or material
breach of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
by, the person seeking indemnification (to the extent so determined in the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) or (ii) legal proceedings
commenced against the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or Lender by any security holder or
creditor thereof arising out of and based upon rights afforded any such security
holder or creditor solely in its capacity as such or (iii) legal proceedings
commenced against the

                                      124

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Lender or any such Lender by any Transferee (as defined in subsection
12.6). Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable
law, each of Holdings and the U.S. Borrower agrees not to assert, and hereby
waives (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to assert and to
waive) all rights for contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect
to all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever, under
or related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or
otherwise against the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender, except to the extent any
of the foregoing (i) arise as a result of the gross negligence of wilful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or any Lender (to the extent so
determined in the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) or (ii)
relate to any violation of Environmental Laws that first occurred on or with
respect to any real property after such real property has been transferred to
the Applicable Administrative Agent by foreclosure, sale, deed in lieu of
foreclosure or other similar transfer. The agreements in this subsection 12.5
shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

          12.6 Successors and Assigns; Participations and Assignments. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the U.S. Borrower,
the Canadian Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the
Canadian Administrative Agent, all future holders of the Notes and the Loans,
and their respective successors and assigns, except that none of Holdings, the
U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower may assign or transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Canadian Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender and
each Lender, and any attempted assignment without such consent shall be null and
void.

          (b) Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its commercial banking,
lending or investment business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants") participating
interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any participating interest in the
Letters of Credit of such Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment
of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender hereunder. In the event of
any such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the
performance thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for
all purposes under this Agreement and the relevant Borrowing Party and the
Applicable Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents. The Borrowing Parties agree that if
amounts outstanding under this Agreement and the Notes are due and unpaid, or
shall have been declared or shall have become due and payable upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the
right of setoff in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under
this Agreement and any Note to the same extent as if the amount of its
participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this

                                      125

<PAGE>

Agreement or any Note; provided that such right of setoff shall be subject to
the obligation of such Participant to share with the Lenders, and the Lenders
agree to share with such Participant, as provided in subsection 12.7. The
Borrowing Parties also agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of subsections 3.10, 5.11 and 5.12 with respect to its participation in
the Letters of Credit, if applicable, and in the Commitments and the Loans
outstanding from time to time as if it were a Lender; provided that in the case
of subsection 5.11(e), such Participant shall have complied with the
requirements of such subsection; provided further that no Participant shall be
entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to any such subsection than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount
of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant
had no such transfer occurred. Each Lender agrees that the participation
agreement pursuant to which any Participant acquires its participating interest
(or any other document) may afford voting rights to such Participant, or any
right to instruct such Lender with respect to voting hereunder, only with
respect to matters requiring the consent of either all of the Lenders hereunder
or all of the Lenders holding the relevant Term Loans or Revolving Credit
Commitments subject to such participation. In each case in which a Lender has
sold a participating interest to a Participant pursuant to this Section 12.6,
such Lender shall maintain a register and record therein the amounts of such
Participant's entitlement to payments of principal and interest with respect to
such participating interest.

          (c) Subject to paragraph (h) of this subsection 12.6, any Lender may,
in the ordinary course of its commercial banking, lending or investment business
and in accordance with applicable law, (i) at any time and from time to time
assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the Notes to any Lender or any Affiliate thereof or any Related Fund; provided
that, in the event of a sale of less than all of such rights and obligations,
such assigning Lender after any such sale to any other Lender or any Affiliate
or Related Fund of such Lender shall retain Commitments and/or Loans and/or L/C
Participating Interests aggregating at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount
as the Applicable Administrative Agent may determine) and (ii) with the consent
of the U.S. Borrower (on its own behalf and, if applicable, on behalf of the
Canadian Borrower; provided that such consent shall not be required after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, or if such
assignment is made in connection with the primary syndication of the Revolving
Credit Commitments or the Term Loans to Persons previously identified to the
U.S. Borrower in writing and agreed to by the U.S. Borrower), and the Applicable
Administrative Agent (which in each case shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) at any time and from time to time assign to one or more additional
banks, mutual funds or financial institutions or other entities who invest in
commercial loans (each, an "Assignee"), all or any part of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the Notes, pursuant to an Assignment and
Acceptance, executed by such Assignee, such transferor Lender (and, except as
provided in clause (i) above, in the case of an Assignee that is not then a
Lender or an Affiliate or Related Fund thereof, by the U.S. Borrower (on its own
behalf and, if applicable, on behalf of the Canadian Borrower) and the
Applicable Administrative Agent), and delivered to the Applicable Administrative
Agent for its acceptance and recording in the applicable Register; provided that
(A) each such sale pursuant to clause (ii) of this subsection 12.6(c) shall be
in a principal amount of at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser

                                      126

<PAGE>

amount as the Applicable Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower may
determine) unless the assigning Lender is transferring all of its rights and
obligations and (B) in the event of a sale of less than all of such rights and
obligations, such Lender after any such sale shall retain Commitments and/or
Loans and/or L/C Participating Interests aggregating at least $1,000,000 (or
such lesser amount as the Applicable Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower
may determine). In lieu of manually executing and delivering to the Applicable
Administrative Agent any such Assignment and Acceptance, the parties to such
assignment may electronically execute and deliver to the Applicable
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance via an electronic settlement
system acceptable to the Applicable Administrative Agent (which initially shall
be ClearPar, LLC). Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording in
the applicable Register, from and after the effective date determined pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder with a Commitment as set forth
therein, and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest transferred, as reflected in such Assignment and Acceptance, be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an
Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of the indemnification provisions set forth in subsection 12.5).

          (d) Each Applicable Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders for
the benefit of the Borrowing Parties, shall maintain at the address of such
Administrative Agent referred to in subsection 12.2 a copy of each Assignment
and Acceptance delivered to it and a register (each, a "Register" and
collectively, the "Registers") for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the U.S. Lenders or Canadian Lenders, as applicable, and (i) the Commitment of
each such Lender and the amount of each U.S. Loan or Canadian Loan, as
applicable, made hereunder, the Type thereof and each Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) any Note evidencing such Loan, (iii) the amounts of any principal
or interest due and payable, or to become due and payable, from the U.S.
Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as applicable, to each such Lender hereunder,
(iv) the amounts of any principal or interest paid to, or for the account of,
each such Lender hereunder, and (v) the amounts of any sums received by such
Administrative Agent hereunder from the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower,
as applicable, as well as each such Lender's share thereof. The entries in the
Registers shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the U.S.
Borrower, the Canadian Borrower, the Administrative Agents and the Lenders shall
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Registers as the owner of a Loan
or other obligation hereunder as the owner thereof for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents, notwithstanding any notice to the
contrary. Any assignment of any Loan or other obligation hereunder shall be
effective only upon appropriate entries with respect thereto being made in the
applicable Register. The Registers shall be available for inspection by the U.S.
Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                                      127

<PAGE>

          (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an Assignee (and, in the case of an Assignee that is not
then a Lender or an Affiliate or a Related Fund thereof, by the U.S. Borrower
(on its own behalf and, if applicable, on behalf of the Canadian Borrower) and
the Applicable Administrative Agent), together with payment to the Applicable
Administrative Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,500 (unless (w)
such Assignment and Acceptance is electronically executed and delivered as
provided in subsection 12.6(b)), (x) such fee is waived at the discretion of the
Applicable Administrative Agent or (y) the assigning Lender is a predecessor
Administrative Agent that has been removed in accordance with subsection 11.9,
in which case such fee shall not apply), the Applicable Administrative Agent
shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Acceptance and (ii) on the
effective date determined pursuant thereto record the information contained
therein in the applicable Register and give notice of such acceptance and
recordation to the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower, if applicable (no
such assignment shall become effective unless and until so recorded); provided
that, in the case of contemporaneous assignments by a Lender to more than one
Related Fund, only a single $3,500 fee shall be payable for all such
contemporaneous assignments (unless such fee is inapplicable or waived as
provided above). On or prior to such effective date, the U.S. Borrower or the
Canadian Borrower, as applicable, at its own expense, shall execute and deliver
to the Applicable Administrative Agent (in exchange for any or all of the Term
Loan Notes, Revolving Credit Notes or C$ Notes of the assigning Lender, if any)
new Term Loan Notes, Revolving Credit Notes or C$ Notes, as the case may be, to
the order of such Assignee and its registered assigns (if requested) in an
amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment, the Term Loans or the C$ Prime
Loans, as the case may be, assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment or any Term
Loans or C$ Prime Loans hereunder, new Term Loan Notes, Revolving Credit Notes
or C$ Notes, as the case may be, to the order of the assigning Lender and its
registered assigns in an amount equal to the Commitment or such Term Loans or C$
Prime Loans, as the case may be, retained by it hereunder (if requested). Such
new Notes shall be dated the Closing Date and shall otherwise be in the form of
the Notes replaced thereby.

          (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
"SPC"), identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender
to the Applicable Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian
Borrower, as applicable, the option to provide to either Borrowing Party all or
any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to
make to such Borrowing Party pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all
or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
Loan pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) with respect to an SPC of a Canadian
Lender, such SPC shall be a resident of Canada for purposes of the ITA. The
making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for
any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability
for which shall remain with the Granting Lender). In

                                      128

<PAGE>

furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is
one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial
paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute against, or
join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings under the
laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this subsection 12.6, any SPC may (i) with
notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the applicable Borrowing
Party and the Applicable Administrative Agent and without paying any processing
fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the
Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the U.S.
Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as applicable, and the Applicable
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Granting Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any
amendment or waiver or any provision of any Credit Document or the obligation to
pay any amount payable by the Granting Lender under the Credit Documents
continue to be the Lender of record hereunder. In each case in which a Lender
has granted to an SPC the option to provide to the U.S. Borrower all or any part
of a Loan that such Lender would otherwise be obligated to make hereunder, such
Lender shall (i) maintain a register and record therein the amounts of such
SPC's entitlement to payments of principal and interest with respect to such
Loan, and (ii) collect from such SPC, prior to such SPC's receipt of payments
with respect to such Loan, the forms, certificates, and statements required
pursuant to Section 5.11 hereof, as if such SPC were a Lender. In each case in
which such SPC has assigned all or a portion of its interest in any Loan to any
financial institution pursuant to this Section 12.6(f), such SPC shall (i)
maintain a register and record therein the amounts of the entitlement of such
financial institution to payments of principal and interest with respect to such
Loan, and (ii) collect from such financial institution, prior to the receipt by
such financial institution of payments with respect to such Loan, the forms,
certificates, and statements required pursuant to Section 5.11 hereof.

          (g) The Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, the Canadian
Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will use reasonable efforts
to protect the confidentiality of any confidential information concerning
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower authorizes
each Lender to disclose (i) to its employees, officers, Affiliates and advisors,
who shall be bound by the confidentiality provisions hereof and who shall use
such information only for purposes of preserving, exercising or enforcing the
rights of such Lender hereunder, (ii) to any regulatory authority as required by
law, (iii) in connection with any enforcement or other legal action (in which
case, such Person agrees to inform the U.S. Borrower prior to making such
disclosure to the extent it is reasonably practicable to do so) and (iv) to any
Participant, Assignee or pledgee (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective
Transferee or to any direct or indirect contractual counterparty under a swap
agreement that relates to

                                      129

<PAGE>

any Loan (or to such contractual counterparty's professional advisor), any and
all information in such Lender's possession concerning Holdings, the U.S.
Borrower and its Subsidiaries which has been delivered to such Lender by or on
behalf of the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
or which has been delivered to such Lender by or on behalf of the U.S. Borrower
or the Canadian Borrower in connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of
the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries prior to becoming a party to this
Agreement; provided that each Lender shall cause its respective prospective
Transferees and swap counterparties (and their professional advisors), to agree
in writing to protect the confidentiality of any confidential information
concerning Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates in
accordance with the provisions of this paragraph (g).

          (h) If, pursuant to this subsection 12.6, any interest in this
Agreement or any Note is transferred to any Transferee which is organized under
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof,
the transferor Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the
effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with the terms of this Agreement
including without limitation subsection 5.11(e).

          (i) For avoidance of doubt, the parties to this Agreement acknowledge
that the provisions of this subsection concerning assignments of Loans and Notes
relate only to absolute assignments and that such provisions do not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment by a Lender of any Loan or Note to any Federal Reserve Bank
in accordance with applicable law; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

          12.7 Adjustments; Set-off. (a) If any relevant U.S. Lender or Canadian
Lender, as applicable (a "benefitted Lender") shall at any time receive any
payment of all or part of any of its Loans or L/C Participating Interests, as
the case may be, or interest thereon, or receive any collateral in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
proceedings of the nature referred to in clause (f) of Section 10, or otherwise)
in a greater proportion than any such payment to and collateral received by any
other relevant U.S. Lender or Canadian Lender, as applicable, if any, in respect
of such other relevant Lender's Loans or L/C Participating Interests, as the
case may be, or interest thereon, in each case except as otherwise contemplated
by this Agreement such benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other
relevant U.S. Lenders or Canadian Lenders, as applicable, such portion of each
such other relevant Lender's Loans or L/C Participating Interests, as the case
may be, or shall provide such other relevant Lenders with the benefits of any
such collateral, or the proceeds thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such
benefitted Lender to share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or
proceeds ratably with each of the relevant U.S. Lenders or Canadian Lenders, as
applicable; provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment or
benefits is thereafter recovered from such benefitted Lender, such purchase
shall be rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest. Subject to paragraph (b) of this
subsection 12.7, the Borrowing Parties agree that each Lender so purchasing a
portion of another Lender's

                                      130

<PAGE>

Loans and/or L/C Participating Interests may exercise all rights of payment
(including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such portion
as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion. The
Applicable Administrative Agent shall promptly give the applicable Borrowing
Party notice of any set-off; provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity of such set-off.

          (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by
law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to Holdings, the
U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, any such notice being expressly waived
by Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and the Canadian Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable law, upon the filing of a petition under any of the provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code or amendments thereto (or in the case of the Canadian
Borrower, any comparable law or statute), by or against; the making of an
assignment for the benefit of creditors by; the application for the appointment,
or the appointment, of any receiver of, or of any substantial portion of the
property of; the issuance of any execution against any substantial portion of
the property of; the issuance of a subpoena or order, in supplementary
proceedings, against or with respect to any substantial portion of the property
of; or the issuance of a warrant of attachment against any substantial portion
of the property of; Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, to set
off and apply against any indebtedness, whether matured or unmatured, of
Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower to such Lender, any amount
owing from such Lender to Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower,
at or at any time after, the happening of any of the above mentioned events. The
aforesaid right of set-off may be exercised by such Lender against Holdings, the
U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower or against any trustee in bankruptcy,
debtor in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver or
execution, judgment or attachment creditor of Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the
Canadian Borrower, or against anyone else claiming through or against Holdings,
the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower or such trustee in bankruptcy, debtor
in possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, receiver, or execution,
judgment or attachment creditor, notwithstanding the fact that such right of
set-off shall not have been exercised by such Lender prior to the making, filing
or issuance, or service upon such Lender of, or of notice of, any such petition;
assignment for the benefit of creditors; appointment or application for the
appointment of a receiver; or issuance of execution, subpoena, order or warrant.
Each Lender agrees promptly to notify Holdings, the U.S. Borrower or the
Canadian Borrower, as applicable, and the Applicable Administrative Agent after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided that the failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.

          12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, including
by means of facsimile, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be
deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. A set of the copies of this
Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the U.S. Borrower and
each of the Administrative Agents. This Agreement shall become effective with
respect to Holdings, the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower, the
Administrative

Agent shall have received copies of this Agreement executed by Holdings, the
U.S. Borrower, the Canadian Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Canadian
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or, in the case of any Lender, shall have
received telephonic confirmation from such Lender stating that such Lender has
executed counterparts of this Agreement or the signature pages hereto and sent
the same to the Administrative Agent.

          12.9 Governing Law; No Third Party Rights. This Agreement and the
Notes and the rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement and the
Notes shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with,
the law of the State of New York. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and, except as
set forth in subsection 12.6, no other Persons shall have any right, benefit,
priority or interest under, or because of the existence of, this Agreement.

          12.10 Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers. (a) Each party to this
Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

               (i) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
     proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents,
     or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof, to
     the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New
     York, the courts of the United States for the Southern District of New
     York, and appellate courts from any thereof;

               (ii) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought
     in such courts, and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have
     to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that
     such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees
     not to plead or claim the same;

               (iii) agrees that service of process in any such action or
     proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or
     certified mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage
     prepaid, to such party at its address set forth in subsection 12.2 or at
     such other address of which the Applicable Administrative Agent shall have
     been notified pursuant thereto; and

               (iv) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
     service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the
     right to sue in any other jurisdiction.

          (b) Each party hereto unconditionally waives trial by jury in any
legal action or proceeding referred to in paragraph (a) above and any
counterclaim therein.

          12.11 Releases. The Administrative Agents and the Lenders agree to
cooperate with Holdings, the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries with respect to
any sale or other disposition permitted by subsection 9.5 and promptly take such
action and execute and deliver such instruments and documents necessary to
release the liens and security interests created by the Security Documents
relating to any of the assets or

                                      132

<PAGE>

property affected by any such sale permitted by subsection 9.5, including,
without limitation, any Uniform Commercial Code or PPSA amendment, release or
termination or partial release or termination statements.

          12.12 Interest. Each provision in this Agreement and each other Credit
Document is expressly limited so that in no event whatsoever shall the amount
paid, or otherwise agreed to be paid, by the Borrowing Parties for the use,
forbearance or detention of the money to be loaned under this Agreement or any
other Credit Document or otherwise (including any sums paid as required by any
covenant or obligation contained herein or in any other Credit Document which is
for the use, forbearance or detention of such money), exceed that amount of
money which would cause the effective rate of interest to exceed the highest
lawful rate permitted by applicable law (the "Highest Lawful Rate"), and all
amounts owed under this Agreement and each other Credit Document shall be held
to be subject to reduction to the effect that such amounts so paid or agreed to
be paid which are for the use, forbearance or detention of money under this
Agreement or such other Credit Document shall in no event exceed that amount of
money which would cause the effective rate of interest to exceed the Highest
Lawful Rate. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement or any other Credit
Document to the contrary, if the maturity of the Loans or the obligations in
respect of the other Credit Documents are accelerated for any reason, or in the
event of any prepayment of all or any portion of the Loans or the obligations in
respect of the other Credit Documents by either of the Borrowing Parties or in
any other event, earned interest on the Loans and such other obligations of the
applicable Borrowing Party may never exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, and any
unearned interest otherwise payable on the Loans or the obligations in respect
of the other Credit Documents that is in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate shall
be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment or
other such event and (if theretofore paid) shall, at the option of the holder of
the Loans or such other obligations, be either refunded to the applicable
Borrowing Party or credited on the principal of the Loans. In determining
whether or not the interest paid or payable, under any specific contingency,
exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the applicable Borrowing Party and the Lenders
shall, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, amortize, prorate,
allocate and spread, in equal parts during the period of the actual term of this
Agreement, all interest at any time contracted for, charged, received or
reserved in connection with this Agreement.

          12.13 Special Indemnification. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, (A) each Lender, or Transferee of any Lender pursuant
to subsection 12.6(g) of this Agreement, shall indemnify the U.S. Borrower, the
Canadian Borrower and each of the Administrative Agents, and hold each of them
harmless against any and all payments, expenses or taxes which the U.S.
Borrower, the Canadian Borrower or either of the Administrative Agents may
become subject to or obligated to pay if and to the extent that, (i) on the
Closing Date or the effective date of transfer, as the case may be, such Lender,
or such Transferee of a Lender pursuant to subsection 12.6(g) of this Agreement,
(a) makes the representation and covenants set forth in subsection 5.11(e) of
this Agreement and the Assignment and Acceptance, and (b) is not in fact also
qualified to make the representation and covenants set forth in subsection
5.11(e) of this Agreement and the Assignment and Acceptance, and (ii) as a

                                      133

<PAGE>

result of any Change in Law or compliance by such Lender, or Transferee, with
any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
central bank or other Governmental Authority the U.S. Borrower, the Canadian
Borrower or either of the Administrative Agents is required to make any
additional payments on account of U.S. withholding taxes and amounts related
thereto with respect to any payments under this Agreement, any Note, or a
Eurodollar Loan, made prior to such Change in Law or request or directive, none
of which payments would have been required if such Lender, or Transferee, was
qualified on the Closing Date or the date of the transfer, as the case may be,
to make the representation and covenants set forth in subsection 5.11(e) of this
Agreement and the Assignment and Acceptance, as the case may be, and (B) each
Lender, or Transferee of any Lender pursuant to subsection 12.6(g) of this
Agreement, agrees that to the extent any amount payable by such Lender or
Transferee pursuant to this subsection 12.13 remains unpaid on any Interest
Payment Date or the date on which any prepayment is made, the U.S. Borrower or
the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be, shall have the right to set-off
against any payment due to such Lender or Transferee on such date any amounts
owing to the U.S. Borrower or the Canadian Borrower, as the case may be,
pursuant to this subsection 12.13.

          12.14 Tax Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
any party subject to confidentiality obligations hereunder or under any other
related document (and any employee, representative or other agent of such party)
may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, such
party's U.S. federal income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax
structure of the transactions contemplated hereby relating to such party and all
materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are
provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, no
such party shall disclose any information relating to such tax treatment or tax
structure to the extent nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply
with applicable securities laws. This paragraph is intended to cause the
transactions contemplated hereby not to be treated as having been offered under
conditions of confidentiality for purposes of Section 1.6011-4(b)(3) (or any
successor provision) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 6011
of the Code, and shall be construed in a manner consistent with such purpose. In
addition, each party hereto acknowledges that it has no proprietary or exclusive
rights to the tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby or any tax
matter or tax idea related to such transactions.

          12.15 Documentation Agents. None of the Documentation Agents shall
have any duties or obligations under this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents, express or implied. None of the Documentation Agents shall incur any
personal liability by reason of being named as a Documentation Agent hereunder.
