share of Common Stock (the &#147;Share&#148;) (or cash equal to the Fair Market

</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vesting. Except as provided in this Paragraph&nbsp;3 and in Paragraphs 4, 6,
7, 10 and 11,
on each Vesting Date you shall become vested in the number or percentage of
the Shares specified next to such
Vesting Date on the Award Statement (which amount may be rounded to
avoid fractional Shares). While
continued active Employment is not required in order to receive
delivery of the Shares corresponding to your
outstanding 2002 Year-End RSUs that are or become vested, all other conditions
of this Award Agreement shall
continue to apply to such vested 2002 Year-End RSUs and the Shares
corresponding to such vested 2002 Year-
End RSUs will not be delivered unless and until those conditions are satisfied.
Unless the Committee determines
otherwise, and except as provided in Paragraphs 3(c), 6 or 7, if your
Employment terminates for any reason, your
rights in respect of all of your 2002 Year-End RSUs with respect to which the
Vesting Date has not occurred as
of the effective date of such termination shall terminate, and no Shares (or
cash) shall be delivered in respect of
such 2002 Year-End RSUs.

on each Delivery Date the number or percentage of Shares specified next to
such Delivery Date on the Award
Statement (which number of Shares may be rounded to avoid fractional
Shares) with respect to your then
outstanding 2002 Year-End RSUs shall be delivered. Unless otherwise provided
in the Signature Card, the Firm
may deliver cash in lieu of all or any portion of the Shares otherwise
deliverable on any Delivery Date. Unless
otherwise determined by the Committee, or as otherwise provided in this
Award Agreement, delivery of Shares
shall be effected by book-entry credit to a custody account (the &#147;Custody
Account&#148;) maintained by you with The
Chase Manhattan Bank or such successor custodian as may be designated by GS
Inc. No delivery of Shares shall
be made unless you have timely returned the Signature Card. You shall be
the beneficial owner of any Shares
properly credited to the Custody Account. You shall have no right to any
dividend or distribution with respect to
such Shares if the record date for such dividend or distribution is
prior to the date the Custody Account is
properly credited with such Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Delivery Date occurs at a time when you
are considered by GS Inc. to be one of its &#147;covered employees&#148; within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;162(m) of the Code,
then, unless the Committee determines otherwise, delivery of the Shares (or
cash) automatically shall be deferred

a covered employee.

to Paragraph
6(b), if your Employment with the Firm is terminated by reason of Extended
Absence or Retirement, and provided
your rights with respect to any outstanding 2002 Year-End RSUs have not
previously terminated, the condition
set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;4(a) shall be waived with respect to your then
outstanding unvested 2002 Year-End RSUs
(as a result of which any such then outstanding 2002 Year-End RSUs shall vest),
but all other conditions of this
Award Agreement shall continue to apply.

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without limiting the application of Paragraph&nbsp;4(b) and Paragraph
4(c), your rights in
respect of any outstanding 2002 Year-End RSUs that become vested
solely by reason of Paragraph&nbsp;6(a)
immediately shall terminate and no Shares (or cash) shall be delivered in
respect of such 2002 Year-End RSUs if,

participation interest in, any Competitive
Enterprise, or (ii)&nbsp;associate in any capacity (including, but not
limited to, association as an officer, employee,
partner, director, consultant, agent or advisor) with any Competitive
Enterprise. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its discretion, this
Paragraph&nbsp;6(b) will not apply if your
termination of employment by reason of Extended Absence or Retirement
is characterized by the Firm as
&#147;involuntary&#148; or by &#147;mutual agreement&#148; other than for Cause and if you
execute an appropriate general waiver
and release of claims and an agreement to pay any associated tax liability,
both as may be prescribed by the Firm
or its designee. No termination of Employment initiated by you,
including any termination claimed to be a
&#147;constructive termination&#148; or termination for &#147;good reason&#148; will
