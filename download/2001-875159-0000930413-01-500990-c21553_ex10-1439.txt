expiry date shall not be extended, then the Administrative Agent will give such
notice if requested to do so by the Required Lenders in a notice given to the

Parties shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to
such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (A) the aggregate LC Exposure of
the Lenders shall not exceed the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate amount of
the Commitments OVER (ii) the aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit
identified in Schedule VI (other than Backstopped Letters of Credit and Replaced
Letters of Credit) at the time outstanding and (B) the sum of (i) the LC
Exposure of each Lender PLUS (ii) the aggregate stated amount of all letters of
credit identified in Schedule VI issued by such Lender (other than Backstopped
Letters of Credit and Replaced Letters of Credit) at the time outstanding shall
not exceed the Commitment of such Lender.

                  (d) EXPIRY DATE. Each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expire
at or prior to the close of business on the date one year after the date of the

substituted or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with, (vi) the
occurrence of any Default, (vii) the existence of any proceedings of the type
described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VIII with respect to any other Account
Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations, (viii) any lack
of validity or enforceability of any of such reimbursement obligations against
any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement
obligations, or (ix) any other event or circumstance


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT

                                      -14-

whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
obligations of any Account Party hereunder.

                  Neither the Administrative Agent, nor any Lender nor any of
their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or
in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Syndicated Letter of Credit
or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of
the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or other communication under or relating to any Syndicated Letter of
Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error
in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes
beyond their control; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to
excuse the Administrative Agent or a Lender from liability to any Account Party
to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims
in respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Parties to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Account Party that are caused by
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or a
Lender. The parties hereto expressly agree that:

                  (i) the Administrative Agent may accept documents that appear
         on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
         Syndicated Letter of Credit without responsibility for further
         investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
         and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such
         Syndicated Letter of Credit;

                  (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have the right, in its
         sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such
         payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
         of such Syndicated Letter of Credit; and

                  (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be
         exercised by the Administrative Agent when determining whether drafts
         and other documents presented under a Syndicated Letter of Credit
         comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to
         the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care
         inconsistent with the foregoing).

                  (c) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Administrative Agent shall,
within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under any Syndicated Letter of
Credit. The Administrative Agent shall promptly after such examination (i)
notify each of the Lenders and the Account Parties by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and (ii) deliver to each Lender a copy of
each document purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Syndicated
Letter of Credit. With respect to any drawing properly made under a Syndicated
Letter of Credit, each Lender will make an LC Disbursement in respect of such
Syndicated Letter of Credit in accordance with its liability under such
Syndicated Letter of Credit and this Agreement, such LC Disbursement to be made
to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for
such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make any
such LC Disbursement available to the beneficiary of such Syndicated Letter of
Credit by promptly

                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -15-

crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account identified by
such beneficiary in connection with such demand for payment. Promptly following
any LC Disbursement by any Lender in respect of any Syndicated Letter of Credit,
the Administrative Agent will notify the Account Parties of such LC
Disbursement; PROVIDED that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice
shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to reimburse the
Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

                  (d) INTERIM INTEREST. If any LC Disbursement with respect to a
Syndicated Letter of Credit is made, then, unless the Account Parties shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made,
the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including
the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Account
Parties reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum equal to (i) 1%
PLUS the Alternate Base Rate to but excluding the date three Business Days after
such LC Disbursement and (ii) from and including the date three Business Days
after such LC Disbursement, 3% PLUS the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (e) RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION. The Account Parties hereby agree,
as between themselves, that if any Account Party shall pay any reimbursement
obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement with respect to a Syndicated Letter
of Credit issued to support the obligations of another Account Party (the
"SPECIFIED ACCOUNT PARTY"), the Specified Account Party shall, on demand (but
subject to the next sentence), pay to such first Account Party an amount equal
to the amount of such reimbursement. The payment obligation of a Specified
Account Party to another Account Party under this paragraph (e) shall be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the
obligations of the Specified Account Party under this Agreement and each other
Credit Document, and such other Account Party shall not exercise any right or
remedy with respect to such reimbursement until payment and satisfaction in full
of all of such obligations of the Specified Account Party.

                  SECTION 2.04.  TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENTS.

                  (a)  SCHEDULED TERMINATION.  Unless previously terminated, the
Commitments shall terminate at the close of business on the Commitment
Termination Date.

                  (b) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTION. The Account Parties
may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments;
PROVIDED that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that
is $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $5,000,000 and (ii) the Account Parties
shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if the total LC Exposure would
exceed the total Commitments.

                  (c) NOTICE OF VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTION. XL Capital
shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days
prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such
election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any
notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each notice delivered by XL Capital pursuant to this Section shall be
irrevocable; PROVIDED that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered
by XL Capital may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness
of other credit facilities, in which


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -16-

case such notice may be revoked by XL Capital (by notice to the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied.

                  (d) EFFECT OF TERMINATION OR REDUCTION. Any termination or
reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the
Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments.

                  SECTION 2.05.  FEES.

                  (a) FACILITY FEE. XL Capital agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a facility fee, which shall
accrue at a rate per annum equal to 0.06%, (i) prior to the termination of such
Lender's Commitment, on the daily amount of such Commitment (whether used or
unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding
the earlier of the date such Commitment terminates and the Commitment
Termination Date and (ii) if such Lender continues to have any LC Exposure after
its Commitment terminates, on the daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure from
and including the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates to but
excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure. Accrued
facility fees shall be payable on each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the
date the Commitments terminate and the Commitment Termination Date; PROVIDED
that after the termination of the Commitments, facility fees shall be payable on
demand. All facility fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day).

                  (b) SYNDICATED LETTER OF CREDIT FEE. XL Capital agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a letter of credit fee
which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to 0.315% on the average daily
aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Syndicated Letters of Credit during
the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of
the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such
Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure. Syndicated Letter of Credit fees accrued
through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business
Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur
after the Effective Date; PROVIDED that all such fees shall be payable on the
date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the
date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Letter of
credit fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                  (c) PARTICIPATED LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. XL Capital agrees to
pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a participation
fee with respect to its participations in Participated Letters of Credit, which
shall accrue at a rate of 0.315% per annum on the average daily amount of such
Lender's LC Exposure in respect of Participated Letters of Credit (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on
which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any such LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Lender a fronting
fee, which shall accrue at a rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily
amount of the LC Exposure in respect of Participated Letters of Credit
(excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date of termination


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -17-

of the Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any such LC
Exposure, as well as the Issuing Lender's standard administrative fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Participated
Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and
fronting fees accrued through and including each Quarterly Date shall be payable
on the third Business Day following such Quarterly Date, commencing on the first
such date to occur after the Effective Date; PROVIDED that all such fees shall
be payable on the date on which the Commitments terminate and any such fees
accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on
demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this paragraph
shall be payable within 10 days after demand. All participation fees and
fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be
payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).

                  (d)  ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES.  XL Capital agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and
at the times separately agreed upon between XL Capital and the Administrative
Agent.

                  (e) PAYMENT OF FEES. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid
on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent
for distribution, in the case of the facility fees and the letter of credit fees
referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section, to the Lenders entitled
thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.06.  INCREASED COSTS.

                  (a)  INCREASED COSTS GENERALLY.  If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
         account of, or credit extended by, any Lender; or

                  (ii)  impose on any Lender any other condition affecting this
         Agreement or any Letter of Credit;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder, then the Account
Parties jointly and severally agree that they will pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional
costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If any Lender determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Letters of Credit issued by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender
or such Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
(taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such
Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to
time the Account Parties will pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any
such reduction suffered.

                                      -18-


                  (c) CERTIFICATES FROM LENDERS. A certificate of a Lender
setting forth such Lender's good faith determination of the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be,
as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to XL
Capital and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Account Parties shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof by XL Capital.

                  (d) DELAY IN REQUESTS. Failure or delay on the part of any
Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED that the
Account Parties shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior
to the date that such Lender notifies XL Capital of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to
claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90 day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.

                  SECTION 2.07.  TAXES.

                  (a) PAYMENTS FREE OF TAXES. Any and all payments by or on
account of any obligation of the Account Parties hereunder shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes; PROVIDED that if
any Account Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case
may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Account Party shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Account Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) PAYMENT OF OTHER TAXES BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. In
addition, each Account Party shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Account
Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days
after written demand to XL Capital therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to XL Capital by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive as between such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and the Account Parties
absent manifest error.

<PAGE>

                                      -19-


                  (d) EVIDENCE OF PAYMENTS. As soon as practicable after any
payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Account Party to a
Governmental Authority, XL Capital on behalf of such Account Party shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued
by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) EXEMPTIONS. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent
shall, at the written request of XL Capital, provide to any Account Party such
form, certification or similar documentation, if any (each duly completed,
accurate and signed) as is currently required by any Account Party Jurisdiction
or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such other requirements, if any, as is
currently applicable in such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction, in order to obtain an exemption from, or reduced rate of,
deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which
such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to an applicable
tax treaty or the law of such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction; PROVIDED that XL Capital shall have furnished to such Lender or
the Administrative Agent in a reasonably timely manner copies of such
documentation and notice of such requirements together with applicable
instructions. The Account Parties shall not be required to indemnify any Lender
or the Administrative Agent under Section 2.07(a) or (c) for any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes would
not be imposed but for the failure by such Lender or the Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, to comply with the provisions of the preceding sentence.
Upon the written request of XL Capital, each Lender and the Administrative Agent
will provide to XL Capital such form, certification or similar documentation
(each duly completed, accurate and signed) as may in the future be required by
any Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such
other requirements, if any, as may be applicable in such Account Party
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction in order to obtain an exemption from, or
reduced rate of, deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes to which such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to
an applicable tax treaty or the law of the relevant jurisdiction, PROVIDED that
neither such Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to
provide such form, certification or similar document if it would be unduly
burdensome, would require such Lender or the Administrative Agent to disclose
any confidential information or would otherwise be materially disadvantageous to
such Lender or the Administrative Agent and PROVIDED FURTHER that the Account
Party shall have furnished to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in a
reasonably timely manner copies of such documentation and notice of such
requirements together with applicable instructions.

                  SECTION 2.08.  PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING
OF SET-OFFS.

                  (a) PAYMENTS BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Account Parties shall
make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether reimbursement
of LC Disbursements, interest or fees, or under Section 2.06 or 2.07, or
otherwise) or under any other Credit Document (except to the extent otherwise
provided therein) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date when due,
in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts
received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -20-

offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments pursuant to
Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in Dollars.

                  (b) APPLICATION OF INSUFFICIENT PAYMENTS. If at any time
insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to
pay fully all amounts of unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then
due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees
then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance
with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second,
to pay unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent otherwise
provided herein: (i) each reimbursement of LC Disbursements shall be made to the
Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.05 shall be made for account of
the Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments
under Section 2.04 shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the
Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments and
(ii) each payment of interest shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata
in accordance with the amounts of interest then due and payable to the
respective Lenders.

                  (d) SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its LC Disbursements and accrued
interest thereon then due than the proportion received by any other Lender, then
the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face
value) participations in the LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of LC Disbursements;
PROVIDED that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed to apply to any payment made by any Account Party pursuant to and
in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained
by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to any Account Party
or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this
paragraph shall apply). Each Account Party consents to the foregoing and agrees,
to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise
against such Account Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to
such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such
Account Party in the amount of such participation.

                  (e) PRESUMPTIONS OF PAYMENT. Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from an Account Party prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -21-

Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that such Account
Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In
such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact made such payment,
then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (f) CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. If any
Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.08(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such
Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations
are fully paid.

                  SECTION 2.09.  MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

                  (a) DESIGNATION OF A DIFFERENT LENDING OFFICE. If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 2.06, or if any Account Party is required to
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.07, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.06 or 2.07, as the
case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender. Each Account Party hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.

                  (b) REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.06, or if any Account Party is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 2.07, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to
make LC Disbursements hereunder, or if any Lender ceases to be an NAIC Approved
Lender, then XL Capital may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may
be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); PROVIDED that (i) XL
Capital shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative
Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding amount of its LC
Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Account Party (in the
case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment
resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.06 or payments required
to be made pursuant to Section 2.07, such assignment will result in a reduction
in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any
such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a

result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the
relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                  SECTION 2.10.  PARTICIPATED LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, in addition to the issuance of Syndicated Letters of Credit provided for
in Section 2.01, any Account Party may request the Issuing Lender to issue, at
any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Participated
Letters of Credit for its own account. Each Participated Letter of Credit shall
be in such form as is consistent with the requirements of the applicable
regulatory authorities in Illinois, California or New York as reasonably
determined by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise agreed to by the
Administrative Agent and XL Capital. Participated Letters of Credit issued
hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments.

                  (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. To
request the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Participated Letter of Credit), an
Account Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing
Lender) to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in
advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a
notice requesting the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Participated Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
(which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Participated Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the
amount of such Participated Letter of Credit, the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare,
amend, renew or extend such Participated Letter of Credit. If requested by the
Issuing Lender, such Account Party also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request
for a Participated Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any
form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by such
Account Party to, or entered into by any Account Party with, the Issuing Lender
relating to any Participated Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

                  (c) LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNTS. A Participated Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Participated Letter of Credit each
Account Party shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure of
the Issuing Lender with respect to Participated Letters of Credit (determined
for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the
Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed $50,000,000
and (ii) the total LC Exposure of the Lenders shall not exceed the total
Commitments.

                  (d) EXPIRY DATE. Each Participated Letter of Credit shall
expire at or prior to the close of business on the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Participated Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any
renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension).

                                      -23-


                  (e) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Participated Letter
of Credit (or an amendment to a Participated Letter of Credit increasing the
amount thereof) by the Issuing Lender, and without any further action on the
part of the Issuing Lender or the Lenders, the Issuing Lender hereby grants to
each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Lender, a
participation in such Participated Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such
Participated Letter of Credit. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of
Participated Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Participated Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance
of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments. In consideration
and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the
Issuing Lender, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made
by the Issuing Lender in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit promptly
upon the request of the Issuing Lender at any time from the time of such LC
Disbursement until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Account Parties or
at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the
Account Parties for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly following receipt by
the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Account Parties pursuant to the
next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment
to the Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made payments
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders
and the Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a
Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any LC
Disbursement shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (f) REIMBURSEMENT. If any Lender shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit, regardless of the
identity of the Account Party of such Participated Letter of Credit, the Account
Parties jointly and severally agree that they shall reimburse such Lender in
respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such LC Disbursement not later than noon, New York City time, on (i)
the Business Day that the Account Parties receive notice of such LC
Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Account
Parties receive such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time.

                  If the Account Parties fail to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Account Parties in respect thereof and such
Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.

                  (g) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Account Parties' joint and
several obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements in respect of any Participated
Letter of Credit as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Participated
Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other
document presented under a Participated Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any

                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -24-

respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect,
(iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Participated Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly
with the terms of such Participated Letter of Credit (PROVIDED that the Account
Parties shall not be obligated to reimburse such LC Disbursements unless payment
is made against presentation of a draft or other document that at least
substantially complies with the terms of such Participated Letter of Credit),
(iv) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Account Party, the
time for any performance of or compliance with any of such reimbursement
obligations of any other Account Party shall be waived, extended or renewed, (v)
any of such reimbursement obligations of any other Account Party shall be
amended or otherwise modified in any respect, or any guarantee of any of such
reimbursement obligations shall be released, substituted or exchanged in whole
or in part or otherwise dealt with, (vi) the occurrence of any Default, (vii)
the existence of any proceedings of the type described in clause (g) or (h) of
Article VIII with respect to any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of
such reimbursement obligations, (viii) any lack of validity or enforceability of
any of such reimbursement obligations against any other Account Party or any
guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations, or (ix) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that
might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of the obligations of any Account Party hereunder.

                  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing
Lender, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the payment or failure to make
any payment under a Participated Letter of Credit (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence) as a result of determining
whether drafts or other documents presented under a Participated Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof, or any error, omission, interruption, loss
or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Participated Letter of Credit (including any document
required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical
terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing
Lender; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing
Lender from liability to the Account Parties to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Account Parties to the extent permitted by applicable law)
suffered by the Account Parties that are caused by the Issuing Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Participated Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that:

                  (i) the Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
         Participated Letter of Credit without responsibility for further
         investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
         and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such
         Participated Letter of Credit;

                  (ii) the Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole
         discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such
         payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
         of such Participated Letter of Credit; and


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -25-


                  (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be
         exercised by the Issuing Lender when determining whether drafts and
         other documents presented under a Participated Letter of Credit comply
         with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the
         extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care inconsistent
         with the foregoing).

                  (h) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Lender shall, within
a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Participated Letter of
Credit. The Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the
Administrative Agent and XL Capital by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such
demand for payment and whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make a LC
Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

                  (i) INTERIM INTEREST. If any LC Disbursement is made with
respect to a Participated Letter of Credit, then, unless the Account Parties
shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is
made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and
including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that
the Account Parties reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum equal
to (i) 1% PLUS the Alternate Base Rate to but excluding the date three Business
Days after such LC Disbursement and (ii) from and including the date three
Business Days after such LC Disbursement, 3% PLUS the Alternate Base Rate.
Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of the Issuing
Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any
Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Lender
shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

                  (j) REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING LENDER. The Issuing Lender may
be replaced at any time by written agreement between XL Capital, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
replacement of the Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become
effective, the Account Parties shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of
the replaced Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(c). From and after the
effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Lender shall
have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Lender under this
Agreement with respect to Participated Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter
and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to refer
to such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and
all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the replaced Issuing Lender shall
remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations
of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Participated Letters
of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to
issue additional Participated Letters of Credit.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                    GUARANTEE

                  SECTION 3.01. THE GUARANTEE. Each Guarantor hereby jointly and
severally guarantees to each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their
respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the LC Disbursements (and
interest) made by the Lenders to each of the Account Parties (other than such
Guarantor in its capacity as an Account Party hereunder) and all other amounts
from time to time owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by such
Account Parties under this Agreement, in each case strictly in accordance with
the terms thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called the
"GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS"). Each Guarantor hereby further jointly and severally
agrees that if any Account Party (other than such Guarantor in its capacity as
an Account Party hereunder) shall fail to pay in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, such Guarantor will promptly pay the same, without any demand or
notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or
renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in
full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in
accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

                  SECTION 3.02. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of
the Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and
several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the obligations of the Account Parties under this Agreement or
any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor, it being the intent of this Article that the obligations of the
Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several,
under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, which shall
remain absolute and unconditional as described above:

                  (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the
         Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of
         the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
         compliance shall be waived;

                  (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein
         shall be done or omitted; or

                  (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
         be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be modified,
         supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under this
         Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein shall
         be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
         or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in
         part or otherwise dealt with.

<PAGE>

                                      -27-


The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any
Account Party under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred
to herein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security
for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  SECTION 3.03. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the Guarantors
under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that
for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Account Party in respect of
the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any
holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result of any
proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Guarantors
jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent
and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender
in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment
constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

                  SECTION 3.04. SUBROGATION. The Guarantors hereby jointly and
severally agree that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments
they shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance
by them of their guarantee in Section 3.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise,
against any Account Party or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  SECTION 3.05. REMEDIES. The Guarantors jointly and severally
agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the
Account Parties under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for
purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against any Account Party and that, in the
event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable
by any Account Party) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors
for purposes of Section 3.01.

                  SECTION 3.06.  CONTINUING GUARANTEE.  The guarantee in this
Article is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations
whenever arising.

                  SECTION 3.07. RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION. The Guarantors (other
than XL Capital) hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any such Guarantor
shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the
payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other Guarantor
(other than XL Capital) shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but
subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount
equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for
this

                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                      -28-

purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such
Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of
such Guaranteed Obligations. The payment obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess
Funding Guarantor under this Section shall be subordinate and subject in right
of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Guarantor
under the other provisions of this Article III and such Excess Funding Guarantor
shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment
and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations.

                  For purposes of this Section, (i) "EXCESS FUNDING GUARANTOR"
means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Guarantor that has paid an
amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii)
"EXCESS PAYMENT" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount
paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such
Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) "PRO RATA SHARE" means, for any Guarantor, the
ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate
present fair saleable value of all properties of such Guarantor (excluding any
shares of stock of any other Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and
liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and
unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder and any obligations of any other Guarantor that have been Guaranteed
by such Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair saleable value
of all properties of all of the Guarantors (other than XL Capital) exceeds the
amount of all the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated,
unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the
Guarantors under this Article III) of all of the Guarantors (other than XL
Capital), determined (A) with respect to any Guarantor that is a party hereto on
the date hereof, as of the date hereof, and (B) with respect to any other
Guarantor, as of the date such Guarantor becomes a Guarantor hereunder.

                  SECTION 3.08. GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. In
any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or
Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 3.01
would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 3.07, be held or
determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims
of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section
3.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the
amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor,
any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, be automatically
limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not
subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  Each Account Party represents and warrants to the Lenders
that:

                  SECTION 4.01. ORGANIZATION; POWERS. Such Account Party and
each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as



                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT

aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every
jurisdiction where such qualification is required.

                  SECTION 4.02. AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The Transactions
are within such Account Parties' corporate powers and have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate and, if required, by all necessary shareholder
action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by such Account
Party and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Account
Party, enforceable against such Account Party in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, examination or similar laws of general applicability
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the application of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  SECTION 4.03. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of (including any
exchange control approval), registration or filing with, or any other action by,
any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and are in
full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or
the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of such Account Party or
any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not
violate or result in a default under any material indenture, agreement or other
instrument binding upon such Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries or assets,
or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any such
Person, and (d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of such Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 4.04. FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.

                  (a) FINANCIAL CONDITION. Such Account Party has heretofore
furnished to the Lenders the consolidated balance sheet and statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of such Account Party and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (A) as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31,
1999 and December 31, 2000, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
independent public accountants (as provided in XL Capital's Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000), and (B) as of
and for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001, as provided in XL Capital's
Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for the fiscal quarter ended March 31,
2001. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of such Account
Party and its respective consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such
periods in accordance with GAAP or (in the case of XL Europe, XL Insurance or XL
Re) SAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in
the case of the statements referred to in clause (B) of the first sentence of
this paragraph.

                  (b) NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since December 31, 2000, there

                  SECTION 4.05.  PROPERTIES.

                  (a) PROPERTY GENERALLY. Such Account Party and each of its
Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real
and personal property material to its business, subject only to Liens permitted
by Section 7.03 and except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with
its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such

                  (b) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Such Account Party and each of its
Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames,
copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business,
and the use thereof by such Account Party and its Subsidiaries does not infringe
upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 4.06.  LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (a) ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS. Except as disclosed in
Schedule III or as routinely encountered in claims activity, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority now pending against or, to the knowledge of such Account Party,
threatened against or affecting such Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination
and that could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the
Transactions.

                  (b) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Schedule IV
and except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, neither such Account Party nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to
comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any
permit, license or other approval required for its business under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has incurred any Environmental Liability, (iii) has
received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv)
knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

                  SECTION 4.07. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND AGREEMENTS. Such
Account Party and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or
its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  SECTION 4.08. INVESTMENT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS. Such
Account Party is not (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company"

paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a)
Taxes that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for
which such Person has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the
extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 4.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used
for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as
of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,
exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan by an amount that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  Except as could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, (i) all contributions required to be made by any
Account Party or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to a Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan have been timely made, (ii) each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been maintained
in compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws and has been maintained, where required, in good standing with the
applicable Governmental Authority and (iii) neither any Account Party nor any of
their Subsidiaries has incurred any obligation in connection with the
termination or withdrawal from any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.

                  SECTION 4.11. DISCLOSURE. The reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information furnished by such Account Party to the Lenders
in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder
(taken as a whole) do not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; PROVIDED that,
with respect to projected financial information, such Account Party represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time.

                  SECTION 4.12. USE OF CREDIT. Neither such Account Party nor
any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose, whether
immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying Margin Stock, and no
Letter of Credit will be used in connection with buying or carrying any Margin
Stock.

                  SECTION 4.13. SUBSIDIARIES. Set forth in Schedule V is a
complete and correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of XL Capital as of the
date hereof, together with, for each such Subsidiary, (i) the jurisdiction of

with the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no outstanding Equity Rights
with respect to any Account Party.

                  SECTION 4.14. WITHHOLDING TAXES. Based upon information with
respect to each Lender provided by each Lender to the Administrative Agent, as
of the date hereof, the payment of the LC Disbursements and interest thereon,
the fees under Section 2.05 and all other amounts payable hereunder will not be
subject, by withholding or deduction, to any Taxes imposed by any Account Party
Jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 4.15. STAMP TAXES. To ensure the legality, validity,
enforceability or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement, it is not
necessary that this Agreement or any other document be filed or recorded with
any Governmental Authority or that any stamp or similar tax be paid on or in
respect of this Agreement, or any other document other than such filings and
recordations that have already been made and such stamp or similar taxes that

                  SECTION 4.16.  LEGAL FORM.  This Agreement is in proper legal
form under the laws of any Account Party Jurisdiction for the admissibility
thereof in the courts of such Account Party Jurisdiction.

         statements of XL Capital so long as the financial information required
         to be contained in such Report is substantially the same as the
         financial information required under this paragraph (b));

         of all periodic and other reports, proxy statements and other materials
         filed by such Account Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries with
         the SEC, or any Governmental Authority succeeding to any or all of the
         functions of said Commission, or with any U.S. or other securities

         7.03(g) and the aggregate book value of liabilities which are subject
         to Liens permitted under Section 7.03(g) (it being understood that the
         reports required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section shall
         satisfy the requirement of this clause (i) of this paragraph (f) if
         such reports set forth separately,

         book values) and (ii) a calculation showing the portion of each of such
         aggregate amounts which portion is attributable to transactions among
         wholly-owned Subsidiaries of XL Capital; and

                  (g) promptly following any request therefor, such other
         information regarding the operations, business affairs and financial
         condition of XL Capital or any of its Subsidiaries, or compliance with
         the terms of this Agreement, as the Administrative Agent or any Lender

         reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Each notice delivered under this Section shall be accompanied by a statement of
a Financial Officer or other executive officer of the relevant Account Party
setting forth the details of the event or development requiring such notice and
any action taken or proposed to be taken by such Account Party with respect
thereto.

                  SECTION 6.03. PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE AND FRANCHISES. Each
Account Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain its
corporate existence and its material rights and franchises in full force and
effect in its jurisdiction of incorporation; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall

Account Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, qualify and
remain qualified as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which failure
to receive or retain such qualification would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 6.04. INSURANCE. Each Account Party will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain with financially sound and reputable
insurers, insurance with respect to its properties in such amounts as is
customary in the case of corporations engaged in the same or similar businesses
having similar properties similarly situated.

                  SECTION 6.05. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Each Account Party

hereafter owned, leased or otherwise possessed by and used or useful in its
business and will make or cause to be made all needful and proper repairs,
renewals, replacements and improvements thereto so that the business carried on
in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times except if the
failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect, PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the foregoing shall not impose on such Account Party or any Subsidiary of
such Account Party any obligation in respect of any property leased by such
Account Party or such Subsidiary in addition to such Account Party's obligations
under the applicable document creating such Account Party's or such Subsidiary's
lease or tenancy.

         all taxes, assessments and other governmental charges or levies imposed
         upon it or any of its properties or income;

                  (b) on or prior to the date when due, all lawful claims of

         upon any such property; and

                  (c) on or prior to the date when due, all other lawful claims
         which, if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien upon any such
         property (other than Liens not forbidden by Section 7.03) or which, if
         unpaid, might give rise to a claim entitled to priority over general
         creditors of such Account Party in any proceeding under the Bermuda
         Companies Law or Bermuda Insurance Law, or any insolvency proceeding,
         liquidation, receivership, rehabilitation, dissolution or winding-up
         involving such Account Party or such Subsidiary;

PROVIDED that, unless and until foreclosure, distraint, levy, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced, such Account Party need not pay or
discharge any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as the
validity thereof is contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted and so long as such reserves or other appropriate
provisions as may be required by GAAP or SAP, as the case may be, shall have
been made therefor and so long as such failure to pay or discharge does not have
a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 6.07. FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES. Such Account
Party will, and will cause each of its consolidated Subsidiaries to, make and
keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements required under Section 6.01 in conformity with GAAP and
SAP, as applicable, and to maintain accountability for assets.

                  SECTION 6.08. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. Each Account
Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all

may thereafter be declared to be due and payable) and thereupon such fees and

in the State of New York (the "UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE")), in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal
to the total LC Exposure as of such date PLUS any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon; PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall
become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to any Account Party described in clause (g) or

of the Account Parties hereby grant a security interest to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in such collateral account and in any
financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with any Account Party or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders,

have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to any Account Party or any of their Subsidiaries that
is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by an Account Party or a Lender, and the Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into
(i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or

                                      -45-

observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V or elsewhere herein, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Account Party), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying
the Lenders and the Account Parties. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with XL Capital, to appoint a
successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1)
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of
the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be
made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to
each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
paragraph). The fees payable by XL Capital to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between XL Capital and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Lead
Arranger, Bookrunner and Co-Syndication Agents named on the cover page of this
Agreement shall not have any duties or liabilities under this Agreement, except
in their capacity, if any, as Lenders.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other

                  SECTION 10.02.  WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS.

                  (a) NO DEEMED WAIVERS; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or
delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power
hereunder shall operate as a


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                       -47-

waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this
Agreement or consent to any departure by the Account Parties therefrom shall in
any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of
this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Administrative
Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the
time.

                  (b) AMENDMENTS. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by the Obligors and the Required Lenders or
by the Obligors and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required
Lenders; PROVIDED that no such agreement shall:

                  (i)  increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written
         consent of such Lender,

                  (ii) reduce the amount of any reimbursement obligation of an
         Account Party in respect of any LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
         interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the
         written consent of each Lender affected thereby,

                  (iii) postpone the scheduled date for reimbursement of any LC
         Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder,
         or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone
         the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment or any Letter of
         Credit (other than an extension thereof pursuant to an "evergreen"
         provision"), without the written consent of each Lender affected
         thereby,

                  (iv) change Section 2.08(c) or 2.08(d) without the consent of
         each Lender affected thereby,

                  (v) release any of the Guarantors from any of their guarantee
         obligations under Article III without the written consent of each
         Lender, and

                  (vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the
         percentage in the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any
         other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
         required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
         determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
         consent of each Lender;

and PROVIDED FURTHER that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION 10.03.  EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.
                                  ----------------------------------

                  (a) COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Account Parties shall pay (i) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its
Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this
Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of one legal
counsel for the Administrative Agent and one legal counsel for the Lenders, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including in connection with any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iii) all transfer, stamp,
documentary or other similar taxes, assessments or charges levied by any
governmental or revenue authority in respect of this Agreement or any other
document referred to herein.

                  (b) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Account
Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
"INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (but not including
Excluded Taxes), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of,
in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any
Letter of Credit or the use of any thereof (including any refusal by any Lender
to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents
presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by any Account
Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any
way to any Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; PROVIDED that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses result from or arise
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c) REIMBURSEMENT BY LENDERS. To the extent that the Account
Parties fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative
Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees
to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its
capacity as such.

                                       -49-


                  (d) WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ETC. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, no Account Party shall assert, and each Account
Party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Letter of Credit or the use thereof.

                  (e)  PAYMENTS.  All amounts due under this Section shall be
payable promptly after written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 10.04.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a) ASSIGNMENTS GENERALLY. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Account Party
shall assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment
or transfer by an Account Party without such consent shall be null and void).
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal
or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) ASSIGNMENTS BY LENDERS. Any Lender may assign to one or
more NAIC Approved Lenders all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment) and under any
Letter of Credit to which it is a party (if such Letter of Credit permits such
assignment or the beneficiary consents thereto); PROVIDED that

                  (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a
         Lender Affiliate, each of the Account Parties and the Administrative
         Agent must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which
         consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),

                  (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a
         Lender Affiliate or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
         assigning Lender's Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the
         assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the
         date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
         delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
         $5,000,000 unless each of the Account Parties and the Administrative
         Agent otherwise consent,

                  (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
         of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement,

                  (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
         to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with
         a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and

                  (v)  the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver
an Administrative Questionnaire to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to XL
Capital);


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                       -50-


PROVIDED FURTHER that any consent of the Account Parties otherwise required
under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under clause
(a), (b), (g) or (h) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing. Upon
acceptance and recording pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and
after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a
Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 10.03). Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does
not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "GRANTING LENDER") may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an "SPV")
of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the
Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Account Parties, the option
to provide to the Account Parties all or any part of any LC Disbursement that
such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Account Parties
pursuant to Section 2.01, PROVIDED that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
commitment by any SPV to make any LC Disbursement, (ii) if an SPV elects not to
exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such LC
Disbursement, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such LC
Disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Account Parties may
bring any proceeding against either or both the Granting Lender or the SPV in
order to enforce any rights of the Account Parties hereunder. The making of an
LC Disbursement by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting
Lender to the same extent, and as if, such LC Disbursement were made by the
Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for
any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable,
for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender makes such
payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the
date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute
against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof
arising out of any claim against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPV may
with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Account Parties or
the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign
all or a portion of its interests in any Letter of Credit to its Granting Lender
or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Account Parties and the
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with
respect to commercial paper issued by such SPV to issue such Letters of Credit
and such SPV may disclose, on a confidential basis, confidential information
with respect to any Account Party and its Subsidiaries to any rating agency,
commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit liquidity
enhancement to such SPV. This paragraph may not be amended without the consent
of any SPV at the time holding LC Disbursements under this Agreement.

                                       -51-


                  (c) MAINTENANCE OF REGISTER BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The
Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Account
Parties, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by any Account Party and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from
time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) EFFECTIVENESS OF ASSIGNMENTS. Upon its receipt of a duly
completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an
assignee, the assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the
assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such
assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent
shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained
therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
paragraph.

                  (e) PARTICIPATIONS. Any Lender may, without the consent of the
Account Parties or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more
banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents
(including all or a portion of its Commitment); PROVIDED that (i) any such
participation sold to a Participant which is not a Lender, a Lender Affiliate or
a Federal Reserve Bank shall be made only with the consent (which in each case
shall not be unreasonably withheld) of XL Capital and the Administrative Agent,
unless a Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case the consent of XL
Capital shall not be required, (ii) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall remain unchanged, (iii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iv) the Account Parties, the Administrative
Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant
to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender
shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or the other Credit Documents; PROVIDED that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the
first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to
paragraph (f) of this Section, the Account Parties agree that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.06 and 2.07 to the same extent
as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
paragraph (b) of this Section.

                  (f) LIMITATIONS ON RIGHTS OF ASSIGNEES AND PARTICIPANTS. A
Participant or Assignee shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.06 and 2.07 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                       -52-

such Participant or the Lender interest assigned, unless the sale of the
participation to such Participant or the assignment is made with the Account
Parties' prior written consent.

                  (g) CERTAIN PLEDGES. Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or
assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.

                  (h) NO ASSIGNMENTS TO ANY ACCOUNT PARTY OR AFFILIATES.
Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign
or participate any interest in any LC Exposure held by it hereunder to any
Account Party or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent
of each Lender.

                  SECTION 10.05. SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Account Parties herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit
is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
The provisions of Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and
remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the expiration or termination of the Letters
of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

                  SECTION 10.06. COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and
any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.07. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                       -53-

and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a
particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 10.08. RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time
and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or the account of any Account Party against any of and all
the obligations of such Account Party now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may
have.

                  SECTION 10.09.  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.

                  (a)  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. Each Obligor hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting
in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern
District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Obligor or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) WAIVER OF VENUE. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

                  (d) SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to
this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  (e) WAIVER OF IMMUNITIES. To the extent that any Account Party
has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from
any legal process (whether


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                       -54-

through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution or execution, on the ground of sovereignty or otherwise) with respect
to itself or its property, it hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, such immunity in respect of its obligations under
this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION 10.11. HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.12.  TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION;
CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  (a) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION. Each of the Account
Parties acknowledge that from time to time financial advisory, investment
banking and other services may be offered or provided to any Account Party or
one or more of their Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of such
Lender and each of the Account Parties hereby authorizes each Lender to share
any information delivered to such Lender by such Account Party and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of
such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate,
it being understood that (i) any such information shall be used only for the
purpose of advising the Account Parties or preparing presentation materials for
the benefit of the Account Parties and (ii) any such subsidiary or affiliate
receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of
this Section as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive
the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or
the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  (b) CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its and its Affiliates'
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure
is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and
instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or
any Lender, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party to this
Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any
suit,


                  LETTER OF CREDIT AND REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                       -55-

action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement in writing containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this paragraph and for the benefit of the
Account Parties, to (a) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement or (b) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any
swap or derivative transaction relating to any Account Party and its
obligations, (vii) with the consent of the Account Parties or (viii) to the
extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of
a breach of this paragraph or (B) becomes available to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than an Account
Party. For the purposes of this paragraph, "Information" means all information
received from an Account Party relating to an Account Party or its business,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by such Account Party;
PROVIDED that, in the case of information received from an Account Party after
the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery
as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of
Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will not trade the
securities of any of the Account Parties based upon non-public Information that
is received by them.

                  SECTION 10.13. JUDGMENT CURRENCY. This is an international
loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars and payment in New York
City is of the essence, and the obligations of each Account Party under this
Agreement to make payment to (or for account of) a Lender in Dollars shall not
be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment
expressed in or converted into any other currency or in another place except to
the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by such
Lender in New York City of the full amount of Dollars payable to such Lender
under this Agreement. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it
is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency (in
this Section called the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY"), the rate of exchange that shall be
applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase such Dollars at the principal office of the
Administrative Agent in New York City with the judgment currency on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of
each Account Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender hereunder (in this Section called an "ENTITLED PERSON")
shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such
judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following
receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the
judgment currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking
procedures purchase and transfer Dollars to New York City with the amount of the
judgment currency so adjudged to be due; and each Account Party hereby, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify
such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in
Dollars, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled
Person in Dollars hereunder exceeds the amount of the Dollars so purchased and
transferred.
