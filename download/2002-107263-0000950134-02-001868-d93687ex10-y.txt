                                  MASTER LEASE

         THIS MASTER LEASE ("Lease") is executed and delivered effective as of
this 13th day of September, 2001 (the "Effective Date"), and is entered into by
and among WILLIAMS HEADQUARTERS BUILDING COMPANY, a Delaware corporation
("Lessor"), WILLIAMS TECHNOLOGY CENTER, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company ("Lessee"), and WILLIAMS COMMUNICATIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Guarantor").

                                    RECITALS

         The circumstances underlying the execution and delivery of this Lease
are as follows:

         A. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
respective meanings given them in Article II, below.

         B. On even date herewith, Lessor has purchased from Lessee One
Technology Center also known as Williams Technology Center, and other related
assets all located in Tulsa, Oklahoma (all of which comprise the Leased
Properties as defined hereinbelow).

         C. Lessor now wishes to lease the Leased Properties to Lessee, and
Lessee wishes to lease the Leased Properties from Lessor, on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Lease.

         D. As a material inducement to Lessor to enter into this Lease,
Guarantor desires to unconditionally guaranty the performance of all of Lessee's
duties and obligations hereunder.

         IN CONSIDERATION of the foregoing, the covenants and agreements
contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Lessor, Lessee and Guarantor agree as
follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                LEASEHOLD ESTATE

         1.1 LEASE. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set
forth, Lessor leases to Lessee, and Lessee leases from Lessor, the Leased
Properties. Each Facility is leased subject to all covenants, conditions,
restrictions, easements and other matters affecting such Facility, whether or
not of record, including the Permitted Encumbrances and other matters which
would be disclosed by an inspection of the Facility or by an accurate survey
thereof.

         1.2 INDIVISIBILITY. This Lease constitutes one indivisible lease of the
Leased Properties, and not separate leases governed by similar terms. The Leased
Properties constitute one economic unit, and the Base Rent and all other
provisions have been negotiated and agreed to based on a demise of all of the
Leased Properties as a single, composite, inseparable transaction and would have
been substantially different had separate leases or a divisible lease


<PAGE>

been intended. Except as expressly provided herein for specific, isolated
purposes (and then only to the extent expressly otherwise stated), all
provisions of this Lease apply equally and uniformly to all the Leased
Properties as one unit. An Event of Default with respect to any Leased Property
is an Event of Default as to all of the Leased Properties. The parties intend
that the provisions of this Lease shall at all times be construed, interpreted
and applied so as to carry out their mutual objective to create an indivisible
lease of all the Leased Properties and, in particular but without limitation,
that for purposes of any assumption, rejection or assignment of this Lease under
11 U.S.C. Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, this is one indivisible and
non-severable lease and executory contract dealing with one legal and economic
unit which must be assumed, rejected or assigned as a whole with respect to all
(and only all) the Leased Properties covered hereby.

         1.3 TERMS. This Lease shall have the Category 1 FF&E Term for the
Category 1 FF&E, the Category 2 FF&E Term for the Category 2 FF&E, and the
Realty Term for the Land and Leased Improvements (collectively the "Term" or
"Terms").

                                   ARTICLE II

                                   DEFINITIONS

         2.1 DEFINITIONS. For all purposes of this Lease, except as otherwise
expressly provided or unless the context otherwise requires, (i) the terms
defined in this Article have the meanings assigned to them in this Article and
include the plural as well as the singular, (ii) all accounting terms not
otherwise defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in accordance with
GAAP as at the time applicable, (iii) unless otherwise specifically designated,
all references in this Lease to designated "Articles," Sections" and other
subdivisions are to the designated Articles, Sections and other subdivisions of
this Lease, and (iv) the words "herein," "hereof" and "hereunder" and other
words of similar import refer to this Lease as a whole and not to any particular
Article, Section or other subdivision.

                  Additional Charges: All Impositions and other amounts,
liabilities and obligations which Lessee assumes or agrees to pay under this
Lease, including without limitation, any and all costs, expenses and charges
relating to the upkeep and operation of the Leased Properties.

                  Affiliate: Any Person which, directly or indirectly, Controls
or is Controlled by or is under common Control with another Person.

                  Approval Threshold: Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($500,000.00).

                  Assessment: Any governmental assessment on the Leased
Properties or any part thereof for public or private improvements or benefits,
whether or not commenced or completed prior to the date hereof and whether or
not to be completed within the Term.

                  Assumed Indebtedness: Any indebtedness or other obligations
expressly assumed in writing by Lessor and secured by a mortgage, deed of trust
or other security agreement to which Lessor's title to the Leased Properties is
subject.

         net to Lessor, so that this Lease shall yield to Lessor the full amount

         any Proceeding for non-payment of Rent, Lessee will not interpose any
         counterclaim or cross complaint or similar pleading of any nature or
         description in such Proceeding unless Lessee would lose or waive such
         claim by the failure to assert it, but Lessee does not waive any rights
         to assert such claim in a separate action brought by Lessee. The
         covenants to pay Rent are independent covenants, and Lessee shall have
         no right to hold back, offset or fail to pay any Rent because of any
         alleged default by Lessor or for any other reason whatsoever.

receive and retain any refund from a taxing authority in respect of an
Imposition paid by Lessee if at the time of the refund no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, but if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing at the time of the refund, Lessee shall not be entitled to receive or
retain such refund and if and when received by Lessor such refund shall be
applied as provided in Article XVI.

sale or the like. Unless Lessee purchases the Leased Properties as provided in
this Lease, upon the expiration of the Term or the earlier termination of this
Lease, without the payment of any additional consideration by Lessor, Lessee

         acceptance, treatment, manufacture, production, installation,
         management, storage, disposal or release of any Hazardous Materials
         except for those

                                       21

         types and quantities of Hazardous Materials necessary for and
         ordinarily associated with the conduct of Lessee's business which are
         used in full compliance with all Environmental Laws.

                  7.3.2 Notice of Environmental Claims, Actions or
         Contaminations. Lessee shall notify Lessor, in writing, immediately
         upon learning of any existing, pending or threatened: (a)
         investigation, inquiry, claim or action by any governmental authority
         in connection with any Environmental Laws, (b) Third Party Claims, (c)
         Regulatory Actions, and/or (d) Contamination of any portion of the
         Leased Properties.

                  7.3.3 Costs of Remedial Actions with Respect to Environmental
         Matters. If any investigation and/or Clean-Up of any Hazardous
         Materials or other environmental condition on, under, about or with
         respect to a Leased Property is required by any Environmental Law,
         Lessee shall complete, at its own expense, such investigation and/or
         Clean-Up or cause any other Person that may be legally responsible
         therefore to complete such investigation and/or Clean-Up.

                  7.3.4 Delivery of Environmental Documents. Lessee shall
         deliver to Lessor complete copies of any and all Environmental
         Documents that may now be in or at any time hereafter come into the
         possession of Lessee.

                  7.3.5 Environmental Audit. At Lessee's expense, Lessee shall
         deliver to Lessor, an Environmental Audit from time to time, upon and
         within thirty (30) days of Lessor's request therefor, but no more than
         once every two (2) calendar years, except in the event of (i) any
         construction or excavation of, or material alteration to any portion of
         the Leased Properties, or (ii) Lessor reasonably suspects that
         Contamination of any portion of the Leased Properties has occurred or
         been discovered, in either case Lessor may thereafter request an
         Environmental Audit. All tests and samplings shall be conducted using
         generally accepted and scientifically valid technology and
         methodologies. Lessee shall give the engineer or environmental
         consultant conducting the Environmental Audit reasonable and complete
         access to the Leased Properties and to all records in the possession of
         Lessee that may indicate the presence (whether current or past) of a
         Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Materials on, in, under,
         about and adjacent to any Leased Property. Lessee shall also provide
         the engineer or environmental consultant full access to and the
         opportunity to interview such persons as may be employed in connection
         with the Leased Properties as the engineer or consultant deems
         appropriate. However, Lessor shall not be entitled to request an
         Environmental Audit from Lessee unless (a) after the Commencement Date
         there have been changes, modifications or additions to Environmental
         Laws as applied to or affecting any of the Leased Properties; (b) a
         significant change in the condition of any of the Leased Properties has
         occurred; (c) there are fewer than six (6) months remaining in the
         Term; or (d) Lessor has another good reason for requesting such
         certificate or certificates. If the Environmental Audit discloses the
         presence of Contamination or any noncompliance with Environmental Laws,
         Lessee shall immediately perform all of Lessee's obligations hereunder
         with respect to such Hazardous Materials or noncompliance.

                  7.3.6 Entry onto Leased Properties for Environmental Matters.
         If Lessee fails to provide an Environmental Audit as and when required
         by Section 7.3.5, in addition to Lessor's other remedies Lessee shall
         permit Lessor from time to time, by its employees, agents, contractors
         or representatives, to enter upon the Leased Properties for the purpose
         of conducting such Investigations as Lessor may desire, the expense of
         which shall promptly be paid or reimbursed by Lessee as an Additional
         Charge. Lessor, and its employees, agents, contractors, consultants
         and/or representatives, shall conduct any such Investigation in a
         manner which does not unreasonably interfere with Lessee's use of and
         operations on the Leased Properties (however, reasonable temporary
         interference with such use and operations is permissible if the
         investigation cannot otherwise be reasonably and inexpensively
         conducted). Other than in an emergency, Lessor shall provide Lessee
         with prior notice before entering any of the Leased Properties to
         conduct such Investigation, and shall provide copies of any reports or
         results to Lessee, and Lessee shall cooperate fully in such
         Investigation.

                  7.3.7 Environmental Matters Upon Termination of the Lease or
         Expiration of Term. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the
         Term of this Lease, Lessee shall cause the Leased Properties to be
         delivered free of any and all Regulatory Actions and Third Party Claims
         and otherwise in compliance with all Environmental Laws with respect
         thereto, and in a manner and condition that is reasonably required to
         ensure that the then present use, operation, leasing, development,
         construction, alteration, refinancing or sale of the Leased Property
         shall not be restricted by any environmental condition existing as of
         the date of such expiration or earlier termination of the Term.

                  7.3.8 Compliance with Environmental Laws. Lessee shall comply
         with, and cause its agents, servants and employees, to comply with, and
         shall use reasonable efforts to cause each occupant and user of any of
         the Leased Properties, and the agents, servants and employees of such
         occupants and users, to comply with each and every Environmental Law
         applicable to Lessee, the Leased Properties and each such occupant or
         user with respect to the Leased Properties. Specifically, but without
         limitation:

                           7.3.8.1 Maintenance of Licenses and Permits. Lessee
                  shall obtain and maintain (and Lessee shall use reasonable
                  efforts to cause each tenant, occupant and user to obtain and
                  maintain) all permits, certificates, licenses and other
                  consents and approvals required by any applicable
                  Environmental Law from time to time with respect to Lessee,
                  each and every part of the Leased Properties and/or the
                  conduct of any business at a Facility or related thereto;

                           7.3.8.2 Contamination. Lessee shall not cause, suffer
                  or permit any Contamination;

                           7.3.8.3 Clean-Up. If a Contamination occurs, the
                  Lessee promptly shall Clean-Up and remove any Hazardous
                  Materials or cause the Clean-Up and the removal of any
                  Hazardous Materials and in any such case such Clean-Up and


                                       23
<PAGE>


                  removal of the Hazardous Materials shall be effected to
                  Lessor's reasonable satisfaction and in any event in strict
                  compliance with and in accordance with the provisions of the
                  applicable Environmental Laws;

                           7.3.8.4 Discharge of Lien. Within twenty (20) days of
                  the date any lien is imposed against the Leased Properties or
                  any part thereof under any Environmental Law, Lessee shall
                  cause such lien to be discharged (by payment, by bond or
                  otherwise to Lessor's absolute satisfaction);

                           7.3.8.5 Notification of Lessor. Within five (5)
                  Business Days after receipt by Lessee of notice or discovery
                  by Lessee of any fact or circumstance which might result in a
                  breach or violation of any covenant or agreement, Lessee shall
                  notify Lessor in writing of such fact or circumstance; and

                           7.3.8.6 Requests, Orders and Notices. Within five (5)
                  Business Days after receipt of any request, order or other
                  notice relating to the Leased Properties under any
                  Environmental Law, Lessee shall forward a copy thereof to
                  Lessor.

                  7.3.9 Environmental Related Remedies. In the event of a breach
         by Lessee beyond any applicable notice and/or grace period of its
         covenants with respect to environmental matters, Lessor may, in its
         sole discretion, do any one or more of the following (the exercise of
         one right or remedy hereunder not precluding the simultaneous or
         subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy hereunder):

                           7.3.9.1 Cause a Clean-Up. Cause the Clean-Up of any
                  Hazardous Materials or other environmental condition on or
                  under the Leased Properties, or both, at Lessee's cost and
                  expense; or

                           7.3.9.2 Payment of Regulatory Damages. Pay on behalf
                  of Lessee any damages, costs, fines or penalties imposed on
                  Lessee or Lessor as a result of any Regulatory Actions; or

                           7.3.9.3 Payments to Discharge Liens. On behalf of
                  Lessee, make any payment or perform any other act or cause any
                  act to be performed which will prevent a lien in favor of any
                  federal, state or local governmental authority from attaching
                  to the Leased Properties or which will cause the discharge of
                  any lien then attached to the Leased Properties; or

                           7.3.9.4 Payment of Third Party Damages. Pay, on

                  immediate payment of all of the costs of such Clean-Up and/or
                  exercise of the remedies set


                                       24

                  forth in this Section 7.3 incurred by Lessor and not
                  theretofore paid by Lessee as of the date of such demand.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

             LEGAL AND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS; ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

         8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL AND INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. In its use,
maintenance, operation and any alteration of the Leased Properties, Lessee, at
its expense, will promptly (i) comply with all Legal Requirements and Insurance
Requirements, whether or not compliance therewith requires structural changes in
any of the Leased Improvements (which structural changes shall be subject to
Lessor's prior written approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) or interferes with or prevents the use and enjoyment of the
Leased Properties, and (ii) procure, maintain and comply with all licenses, and
other authorizations required for the use of the Leased Properties and Lessee's
Personal Property then being made, and for the proper erection, installation,
operation and maintenance of the Leased Properties or any part thereof. The
judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction, or the admission of Lessee in
any action or Proceeding against Lessee, whether or not Lessor is a party
thereto, that Lessee has violated any such Legal Requirements or Insurance
Requirements shall be conclusive of that fact as between Lessor and Lessee.

         8.2 CERTAIN COVENANTS.

                  8.2.1 Existence; Conduct of Business. Lessee, Guarantor, and
         WCG each will (i) continue to engage in business of the same general
         type as now conducted and (ii) do or cause to be done all things
         necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its
         legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges,
         franchises, patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names material to
         the conduct of its business.

                  8.2.2 Payment of Obligations. Lessee, Guarantor and WCG each
         (i) will pay its Debt and other material obligations, including tax
         liabilities, before the same shall become delinquent or in default,
         except where (a) the validity or amount thereof is being contested in
         good faith by appropriate legal process, (b) has set aside on its books
         adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP, (c)
         such contest effectively suspends collection of the contested
         obligation and the enforcement of any Encumbrance securing such
         obligation and (d) the failure to make payment pending such contest
         could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect
         and (ii) shall not breach, in any material respect, or permit to exist
         any material default under, the terms of any material lease,
         commitment, contract, instrument or obligation to which it is a party,
         or by which its properties or assets are bound, except where the
         failure to do the foregoing would not in the aggregate have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  8.2.3 Maintenance of Properties. Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG
         each will keep and maintain all property material to the conduct of its
         business in good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear
         excepted.

                  8.2.4 Insurance. Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG each will
         maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies,
         insurance in such amounts and against such risks as are customarily
         maintained by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses
         operating in the same or similar locations.

                  8.2.5 Casualty and Condemnation. The Lessee will furnish to
         Lessor prompt written notice of any casualty or other insured damage to
         any portion of any of Guarantor's property or assets or the
         commencement of any action or Proceeding for the taking of any of
         Guarantor's property or assets or any part thereof or interest therein
         under power of eminent domain or by condemnation or similar Proceeding
         (in each case with a value in excess of $10,000,000).

                  8.2.6 Books and Records; Inspection and Audit Rights. Lessee,
         Guarantor, and WCG each will keep proper books of record and account in
         which materially full, true and correct entries are made of all
         dealings and transactions in relation to its business and activities.
         Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG each will permit any representatives
         designated by the Lessor at the expense of Lessor, or, if an Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing, at the expense of the
         Lessee, upon reasonable prior notice, to visit and inspect its
         properties, to examine and make extracts from its books and records,
         and to discuss its affairs, finances and condition with its officers
         and independent accountants, all at such reasonable times and as often
         as reasonably requested.

                  8.2.7 Compliance with Laws. Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG each
         will comply with all laws, rules, regulations and orders of any
         Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property (including,
         without limitation, Environmental Laws and ERISA and the rules and
         regulations thereunder), except where the necessity of compliance
         therewith is contested in good faith by appropriate action and such
         failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, could not
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         Lessee and Guarantor each will execute any and all further documents,
         financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all such
         further actions (including the filing and recording of financing
         statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other
         documents), which may be required under any applicable law, or which
         the Lessor may reasonably request, to effectuate the transactions
         contemplated by this Lease or to grant, preserve, protect or perfect
         the Encumbrances created or intended to be created in connection with

                                   MAINTENANCE

         9.1 MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR.

                  9.1.1 Status and Quality. Lessee, at its expense, will keep or
         cause to be kept, the Leased Properties, and all landscaping, private
         roadways, sidewalks and curbs appurtenant thereto which are under
         Lessee's control and Lessee's Personal Property in good order and
         repair, whether or not the need for such repairs arises out of Lessee's
         use, any prior use, the elements or the age of the Leased Properties or
         any portion thereof, or any cause whatsoever except the act or
         negligence of Lessor, and with reasonable promptness shall make all
         necessary and appropriate repairs thereto of every kind and nature,
         whether interior or exterior, structural or non-structural, ordinary or
         extraordinary, foreseen or unforeseen or arising by reason of a
         condition existing prior to the Commencement Date (concealed or
         otherwise). Lessee shall at all times maintain, operate and otherwise
         manage the Leased Properties on a basis and in a manner consistent with
         the higher of that (i) customarily applied to Class A commercial office
         buildings in the vicinity of the City of Tulsa, Oklahoma, or (ii)
         utilized by Lessor in the management of Lessor's facilities adjacent to
         the Center. All repairs shall, to the extent reasonably


                                       30
<PAGE>


         achievable, be at least equivalent in quality to the original work or
         the property to be repaired shall be replaced. Lessee will not take or
         omit to take any action the taking or omission of which might
         materially impair the value or the usefulness of the Leased Properties
         or any parts thereof for the Primary Intended Use.

                  9.1.2 No Liability of Lessor. Lessor shall not under any
         circumstances be required to maintain, build or rebuild any
         improvements on the Leased Properties (or any private roadways,
         sidewalks or curbs appurtenant thereto), or to make any repairs,
         replacements, alterations, restorations or renewals of any nature or
         description to the Leased Properties, whether ordinary or
         extraordinary, structural or non-structural, foreseen or unforeseen, or
         upon any adjoining property, whether to provide lateral or other
         support or abate a nuisance, or otherwise, or to make any expenditure
         whatsoever with respect thereto, in connection with this Lease. Lessee
         hereby waives, to the extent permitted by law, the right to make
         repairs at the expense of Lessor pursuant to any law in effect at the
         time of the execution of this Lease or hereafter enacted.

                  9.1.3 Contracting with Third Parties. Nothing contained in
         this Lease shall be construed as (i) constituting the consent or
         request of Lessor, expressed or implied, to any contractor,
         subcontractor, laborer, materialmen or vendor to or for the performance
         of any labor or services or the furnishing of any materials or other
         property for the construction, alteration, addition, repair or
         demolition of or to any Leased Property or any part thereof, or (ii)
         giving Lessee any right, power or permission to contract for or permit
         the performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
         materials or other property in such fashion as would permit the making
         of any claim against Lessor in respect thereof or to make any agreement
         that may create, or in any way be the basis for any right, title,
         interest, lien, claim or other Encumbrance upon the estate of Lessor in
         the Leased Properties, or any portion thereof. Lessor shall have the
         right to give, record and post, as appropriate, notices of
         non-responsibility under any mechanics' and construction lien laws now
         or hereafter existing.

                  9.1.4 Replacements. Lessee (i) shall promptly replace any of
         the Leased Improvements or Leased Personal Property which become worn
         out, obsolete or unusable or unavailable for the purpose for which
         intended, and (ii) in Lessee's reasonable judgment, may acquire a
         substitute for any item or items of Leased Personal Property which is
         of higher or better quality, performance or function than the item for
         which it is substituted. All replacements shall have a value and
         utility at least equal to that of the items replaced and shall become
         part of the Leased Properties immediately upon their acquisition by
         Lessee. Upon Lessor's request, Lessee shall promptly execute and
         deliver to Lessor a bill of sale or other instrument establishing
         Lessor's lien-free ownership of such replacements. Lessee shall
         promptly repair all damage to the Leased Properties incurred in the
         course of such replacement.

                  9.1.5 Vacation and Surrender. Lessee will, upon the expiration
         or prior termination of the Term, vacate and surrender the Leased
         Properties to Lessor in the condition in which they were originally
         received from Lessor, in good operating


                                       31
<PAGE>


         condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, except as repaired,
         rebuilt, restored, altered or added to as permitted or required by the
         provisions of this Lease.

         9.2 ENCROACHMENTS; RESTRICTIONS. ETC. If, at any time, any of the
Leased Improvements are alleged to encroach upon any property, street or right
of way adjacent to a Leased Property, or to violate any restrictive covenant, or
to impair the rights of others under any easement or right of way, Lessee shall
promptly settle such allegations or take such other lawful action as may be
necessary in order to be able to continue the use of a Leased Property for the
Primary Intended Use substantially in the manner and to the extent such Leased
Property was being used at the time of the assertion of such violation,
impairment or encroachment, provided, however, that no such action shall violate
any other provision of this Lease and any alteration of a Leased Property must
be made in conformity with the applicable requirements of Article X. Lessee
shall not have any claim against Lessor or offset against any of Lessee's
obligations under this lease with respect to any such violation, impairment or
encroachment.

                                    ARTICLE X

                            ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS

         10.1 Construction of Alterations and Additions to the Leased
Properties. Lessee shall not (a) make or permit to be made any structural
alterations, improvements or additions of or to the Leased Properties or any
part thereof, or (b) materially alter the plumbing, HVAC or electrical systems
thereon or (c) make any other alterations, improvements or additions the cost of
which exceeds (i) Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00), per alteration,
improvement or addition, or (ii) One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), in any
Lease Year, unless and until Lessee has (d) caused complete plans and
specifications therefor to have been prepared by a licensed architect and
submitted to Lessor at least ninety (90) Business Days before the planned start
of construction thereof, (e) obtained Lessor's written approval thereof and if
required, the approval of any Facility Mortgagee, and (f) if required to do so
by Lessor, provided Lessor with reasonable assurance of the payment of the cost
of any such alterations, improvements or additions, in the form of a bond,
letter of credit or cash deposit. If Lessor requires a deposit, Lessor shall
retain and disburse the amount deposited in the same manner as is provided for
insurance proceeds in Section 14.6. If the deposit is reasonably determined by
Lessor at any time to be insufficient for the completion of the alteration,
improvement or addition, Lessee shall immediately increase the deposit to the
amount reasonably required by Lessor. Lessee shall be responsible for the
completion of such improvements in accordance with the plans and specifications
approved by Lessor, and shall promptly correct any failure with respect thereto.

                  10.1.1 Lessor's Approval Not Required. Alterations and
         improvements not falling within the categories described in Section
         10.1 may be made by Lessee without the prior approval of Lessor, (i)
         but only in the event any such alternatives or improvements do not
         result in a material reduction in Lessor's opinion, in the value of the
         Leased Properties, and (ii) Lessee shall give Lessor at least thirty
         (30) days prior written Notice of any such alterations and improvements
         in each and every case.

<PAGE>


                  10.1.2 Quality of Work. All alterations, improvements and
         additions shall be constructed in a first class, workmanlike manner, in
         compliance with all Insurance Requirements and Legal Requirements, be
         in keeping with the character of the Leased Properties and the area in
         which the Leased Properties are located and be designed and constructed
         so that the value of the Leased Properties will not be diminished or
         and that the Primary Intended Use of the Leased Properties will not be
         changed. All improvements, alterations and additions shall immediately
         become a part of the Leased Properties.

                  10.1.3 No Claim Against Lessor. Lessee shall have no claim
         against Lessor at any time in respect of the cost or value of any such
         improvement, alteration or addition. There shall be no adjustment in
         the Rent by reason of any such improvement, alteration or addition.
         With Lessor's consent, expenditures made by Lessee pursuant to this
         Article X may be included as capital expenditures for purposes of
         inclusion in the capital expenditures budget for the Facilities and for
         measuring compliance with the obligations of Lessee set forth in
         Section 8.2.

                  10.1.4 Asbestos - Containing Material. In connection with any
         alteration which involves the removal, demolition or disturbance of any
         asbestos-containing material, Lessee shall cause to be prepared at its
         expense a full asbestos assessment applicable to such alteration, and
         shall carry out such asbestos monitoring and maintenance program as
         shall reasonably be required thereafter in light of the results of such
         a assessment.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                      LIENS

         11.1 LIENS. Without the consent of Lessor or as expressly permitted
elsewhere herein, Lessee will not directly or indirectly create or allow to
remain and will promptly discharge at its expense any lien, Encumbrance,
attachment, title retention agreement or claim upon the Leased Properties, and
any attachment, levy, claim or Encumbrance in respect of the Rent, except for
(i) Permitted Encumbrances, (ii) liens of mechanics, laborers, materialmen,

                                   ARTICLE XII

                         PERMITTED CONTESTS AND DEPOSITS

         12.1 PERMITTED CONTESTS. Lessee, on its own or on Lessor's behalf (or
in Lessor's name), but at Lessee's sole cost and expense, shall have the right
to contest, by an appropriate legal Proceeding conducted in good faith and with
due diligence, the amount or validity of any Imposition, Legal Requirement or
Insurance Requirement or Claim, provided (a) prior Notice of such contest is
given to Lessor, (b) the Leased Properties would not be in any danger of being
sold, uninsured or underinsured, forfeited or attached as a result of such
contest, and there is no risk to Lessor of a loss of or interruption in the
payment of, Rent, (c) in the case of


                                       33
<PAGE>


an unpaid Imposition or Claim, collection thereof is suspended during the
pendency of such contest, (d) in the case of a contest of a Legal Requirement,
compliance may legally be delayed pending such contest. Upon request of Lessor,
Lessee shall deposit funds or assure Lessor in some other manner reasonably
satisfactory to Lessor that a contested Imposition or Claim, together with
interest and penalties, if any, thereon, and any and all costs for which Lessee
is responsible will be paid if and when required upon the conclusion of such
contest. Lessee shall defend, indemnify and save harmless Lessor from all costs
or expenses arising out of or in connection with any such contest, including but
not limited to attorneys' fees. If at any time Lessor reasonably determines that
payment of any Imposition or Claim, or compliance with any Legal or Insurance
Requirement being contested by Lessee is necessary in order to prevent loss of
any of the Leased Properties or Rent or civil or criminal penalties or other
damage, upon such prior Notice to Lessee as is reasonable in the circumstances
Lessor may pay such amount, require Lessee to comply with such Legal or
Insurance Requirement or take such other action as it may deem necessary to
prevent such loss or damage. If reasonably necessary, upon Lessee's written
request Lessor, at Lessee's expense, shall cooperate with Lessee in a permitted
contest, provided Lessee upon demand reimburses Lessor for Lessor's costs
incurred in cooperating with Lessee in such contest.

                                    INSURANCE

         13.1 GENERAL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. Lessee will carry or cause to be
carried and maintained in force throughout the entire Term (except as
specifically noted to the contrary) insurance as described in Sections 13.1.1
through 13.1.5, with insurance companies and deductibles/retentions reasonably
acceptable to Lessor. The limits set forth below are minimum limits and will not
be construed to limit Lessee's liability. All costs and deductible amounts will
be for the sole account of the Lessee.

                  13.1.1 Worker's Compensation Insurance. Workers' compensation
         insurance complying with the laws of the State or States having
         jurisdiction over each employee, whether or not Lessee is required by
         such laws to maintain such insurance, and Employer's Liability with
         limits of $1,000,000 each accident, $1,000,000 disease each employee,
         and $1,000,000 disease policy limit, provided however, in lieu of such
         insurance, Lessee may become a qualified self insured for such
         coverage, in which event such coverage shall not be required unless

transfer such amounts to the Facility Mortgagee, unless, pursuant to written
direction by Lessor, Lessee makes such deposits directly with the Facility
Mortgagee.

         13.3 INCREASE IN LIMITS. If from time to time Lessor determines, in the
exercise of its reasonable business judgment, that the limits of the personal
injury or property damage - public liability insurance then being carried are
insufficient, upon Notice from Lessor Lessee shall cause such limits to be

to the provisions of this Section.

         13.4 BLANKET POLICY. Any insurance required by this Lease may be
provided by so called blanket policies of insurance carried by Lessee, provided,
however, that the coverage afforded Lessor thereby may not thereby be less than
or materially different from that which would be provided by a separate policies

meet the requirements of all Facility Mortgages.

         13.5 COPIES OF POLICIES; CERTIFICATES. Copies of the policies of
insurance required by this Lease and certificates thereof shall be delivered to
Lessor not less than thirty (30) days prior to their effective date (and, with

premiums therefor when due, which premiums shall be repayable to Lessor upon
written demand therefor as Additional Charges.

                       DISBURSEMENT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS

         14.1 INSURANCE PROCEEDS. Net Proceeds shall be paid to Lessor and held,
disbursed or retained by Lessor as provided herein.

                  14.1.1 Proceeds of All-Risk Property Insurance. If the Net
         Proceeds are less than the Approval Threshold, and no Event of Default
         has occurred and is continuing, Lessor


                                       36
<PAGE>


         shall pay the Net Proceeds to Lessee promptly upon Lessee's completion
         of the restoration of the damaged or destroyed Leased Property. If the
         Net Proceeds equal or exceed the Approval Threshold, and no Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, the Net Proceeds shall be made
         available for restoration or repair as provided in Section 14.6. Within
         fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the Net Proceeds of All-Risk
         Insurance, Lessor shall determine in its reasonable judgment, as to the
         portion thereof, if any, attributable to the Lessee's Personal Property
         that Lessee is not required and does not elect to restore or replace,
         and the portion so determined attributable to the Lessee's Personal
         Property that Lessee is not required and does not elect to restore or
         replace shall be paid to Lessee.

         14.2 RESTORATION IN THE EVENT OF DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. If all or any
portion of the Leased Properties is damaged by fire or other casualty, Lessee
shall (a) give Lessor Notice of such damage or destruction within five (5)
Business Days of the occurrence thereof, (b) within thirty (30) Business Days of
the occurrence commence the restoration of the Leased Properties and (c)
thereafter diligently proceed to complete such restoration to substantially the
same (or better) condition as the Leased Properties were in immediately prior to
the damage or destruction as quickly as is reasonably possible, but in any event
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the occurrence. Regardless of the
anticipated cost thereof, if the restoration of a Leased Property requires any
modification of structural elements, prior to commencing such modification
Lessee shall obtain Lessor's written approval of the plans and specifications
therefor.

         14.3 RESTORATION OF LESSEE'S PROPERTY. If Lessee is required to restore
the Leased Properties, Lessee shall also concurrently restore any of Lessee's
Personal Property that is integral to the Primary Intended Use of the Leased
Properties at the time of the damage or destruction.

         14.4 NO ABATEMENT OF RENT. Absent termination of this Lease as provided
herein, there shall be no abatement of Rent by reason of any damage to or the
partial or total destruction of any portion of the Leased Properties.

         14.5 WAIVER. Except as provided elsewhere in this Lease, Lessee hereby
waives any statutory or common law rights of termination which may arise by
reason of any damage to or destruction of the Leased Properties.

         14.6 DISBURSEMENT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE
APPROVAL THRESHOLD. If Lessee restores or repairs the Leased Properties pursuant
to this Article XIV, and if the Net Proceeds equal or exceed the Approval
Threshold, the restoration or repair and disbursement of funds to Lessee shall
be in accordance with the following procedures:

                  14.6.1 Plans and Specifications. The restoration or repair
         work shall be done pursuant to plans and specifications approved by
         Lessor and a certified construction cost statement, to be obtained by
         Lessee from a contractor reasonably acceptable to Lessor, showing the
         total cost of the restoration or repair; to the extent the cost exceeds
         the Net


                                       37
<PAGE>


         Proceeds, Lessee shall deposit with Lessor the amount of the excess
         cost, and Lessor shall disburse the funds so deposited in payment of
         the costs of restoration or repair before any disbursement of Net
         Proceeds.

                  14.6.2 Construction Funds. Construction Funds shall be made
         available to Lessee upon request, no more frequently than monthly, as
         the restoration and repair work progresses, subject to a ten (10%)
         percent holdback, pursuant to certificates of an architect selected by
         Lessee that, in the judgment of Lessor, reasonably exercised, is highly
         qualified in the design and construction of the type of Facility being
         repaired and is otherwise reasonably acceptable to Lessor, which
         certificates must be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
         Lessor.

                  14.6.3 Lien Waivers. After the first disbursement to Lessee,
         sworn statements and lien waivers in an amount at least equal to the
         amount of Construction Funds previously paid to Lessee shall be
         delivered to Lessor from all contractors, subcontractors and material
         suppliers covering all labor and materials furnished through the date
         of the previous disbursement.

                  14.6.4 Progress of Work. Lessee shall deliver to Lessor such
         other evidence as Lessor may reasonably request from time to time
         during the course of the restoration and repair, as to the progress of
         the work, compliance with the approved plans and specifications, the
         cost of restoration and repair and the total amount needed to complete
         the restoration and repair, and showing that there are no liens against
         the Leased Properties arising in connection with the restoration and
         repair and that the cost of the restoration and repair at least equals
         the total amount of Construction Funds then disbursed to Lessee
         hereunder.

                  14.6.5 Inadequacy of Construction Funds. If the Construction
         Funds are at any time determined by Lessor to be inadequate for payment
         in full of all labor and materials for the restoration and repair,
         Lessee shall immediately pay the amount of the deficiency to Lessor to
         be held and disbursed as Construction Funds prior to the disbursement
         of any other Construction Funds then held by Lessor.

                  14.6.6 Disbursement. The Construction Funds may be disbursed
         by Lessor to Lessee or to the persons entitled to receive payment
         thereof from Lessee, and such disbursement in either case may be made
         directly or through a third party escrow agent, such as, but not
         limited to, a title insurance company, or its agent, all as Lessor may
         determine in its sole discretion. Provided Lessee is not in default
         hereunder, any excess Construction Funds shall be paid to Lessee upon
         completion of the restoration or repair.

                  14.6.7 Lessee Default. If Lessee at any time fails to promptly
         and fully perform the conditions and covenants set out hereinabove in
         this Section 14.6, and the failure is not corrected within ten (10)
         days of written Notice thereof, or if during the restoration or repair
         an Event of Default occurs hereunder, Lessor may, at its option,
         immediately cease making any further payments to Lessee for the
         restoration and repair.


                                       38
<PAGE>


                  14.6.8 Lessor Reimbursement. Lessor may reimburse itself out
         of the Construction Funds for its reasonable expenses incurred in
         administering the Construction Funds and inspecting the restoration and
         repair work, including without limitation attorneys' and other
         professional fees and escrow fees and expenses.

         14.7 NET PROCEEDS PAID TO FACILITY MORTGAGEE. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if any Facility Mortgagee is entitled to any Net
Proceeds, or any portion thereof, under the terms of any Facility Mortgage, the
Net Proceeds shall be applied, held and/or disbursed in accordance with the
terms of the Facility Mortgage. Lessor shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Net Proceeds to be applied to the restoration of the Leased
Properties.

         14.8 TERMINATION OF LEASE. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in the event the amount of the Net Proceeds from any one (1)
occurrence, (i) exceeds $80,000,000.00, or (ii) exceeds $20,000,000.00 during
the final two (2) years of the Realty Term, Lessor may exercise its option to
require Lessee to purchase the Leased Properties as set forth in Section 42.2.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                                  CONDEMNATION

         15.1 TOTAL TAKING OR OTHER TAKING WITH EITHER LEASED PROPERTY RENDERED
UNSUITABLE FOR ITS PRIMARY INTENDED USE. If title to the fee of the whole of a
Leased Property is Taken, this Lease shall cease and terminate as to the Leased
Property Taken as of the Date of Taking by the Condemnor and Rent shall be
apportioned as of the termination date, provided, however, that if the Award to
Lessor is less than the Repurchase Price for such Leased Property at the time of
such Award, it shall be a condition precedent to the termination of this Lease
as to such Leased Property that Lessee pay the amount of the deficiency to
Lessor. If title to the fee of less than the whole of a Leased Property is
Taken, but such Leased Property is thereby rendered Unsuitable for Its Primary
Intended Use, Lessee and Lessor shall each have the option by written Notice to
the other, at any time prior to the taking of possession by, or the date of
vesting of title in, the Condemnor, whichever first occurs, to terminate this
Lease with respect to such Leased Property as of the date so determined, in
which event this Lease shall thereupon so cease and terminate as of the earlier
of the date specified in such Notice or the date on which possession is taken by
the Condemnor. If this Lease is so terminated as to a Leased Property, Rent
shall be apportioned as of the termination date, and Lessee shall be deemed to
have elected to purchase such Leased Property for the Repurchase Price therefor.
Lessee shall complete the purchase within forty-five (45) days of the Taking,
and Lessee shall receive credit against such Repurchase Price for any portion of
the Award received by Lessor.

         15.2 ALLOCATION OF AWARD. The total Award made with respect to all or
any portion of a Leased Property or for loss of Rent, or for loss of business,
shall be solely the property of and payable to Lessor. Nothing contained in this
Lease will be deemed to create any


                                       39
<PAGE>


additional interest in Lessee, or entitle Lessee to any payment based on the
value of the unexpired term or so-called "bonus value" to Lessee of this Lease.
Any Award made for the taking of Lessee's Personal Property that is not integral
to the Primary Intended Use of the Facilities, or for removal and relocation
expenses of Lessee in any such Proceeding shall be payable to Lessee. Any Award
made for the taking of Lessee's Personal Property that is integral to the
Primary Intended Use of the Facilities shall be payable to Lessor. In any
Proceeding with respect to an Award, Lessor and Lessee shall each seek its own
Award in conformity herewith, at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Lessee may pursue a claim for loss of its business, provided that under the laws
of the State, such claim will not diminish the Award to Lessor.

         15.3 PARTIAL TAKING. In the event of a Partial Taking, and Lessee, at
its own cost and expense, shall within sixty (60) days of the taking of
possession by, or the date of vesting of title in, the Condemnor, whichever
first occurs/date on which such Notice is given commence the restoration of the
Leased Premises to a complete architectural unit of the same general character
and condition (as nearly as may be possible under the circumstances) as existed
immediately prior to the Partial Taking, and complete such restoration with all
reasonable dispatch, but in any event within one hundred eighty (180) days of
the date on which such Notice is given. Lessor shall contribute to the cost of
restoration only such portion of the Award as is made therefor. As long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, if such portion of the Award is
in an amount less than the Approval Threshold, Lessor shall pay the same to
Lessee upon completion of such restoration. As long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, if such portion of the Award is in an amount equal
to or greater than the Approval Threshold, Lessor shall make such portion of the
Award available to Lessee in the manner provided in Section 14.6 with respect to
Net Proceeds in excess of the Approval Threshold.

         15.4 TEMPORARY TAKING. If there is a Taking of possession or the use of
all or part of a Leased Property, but the fee of such Leased Property is not
Taken in whole or in part, until such Taking of possession or use continues for
more than six (6) months, all the provisions of this Lease shall remain in full
force and effect and the entire amount of any Award made for such Taking shall
be paid to Lessee provided there is then no Event of Default. Upon the
termination of any such period of temporary use or occupancy, Lessee at its sole
cost and expense shall restore the affected Leased Property, as nearly as may be
reasonably possible, to the condition existing immediately prior to such Taking.
If any temporary Taking continues for longer than six (6) months, and fifty
percent (50%) or more of any Leased Property is thereby rendered Unsuitable for
Its Primary Use, this Lease shall cease and terminate as to the affected Leased
Property as of the last day of the sixth (6th) month, but if less than fifty
percent (50%) of such Facility is thereby rendered Unsuitable for Its Primary
Use, Lessee and Lessor shall each have the option by at least sixty (60) day's
prior written Notice to the other, at any time prior to the end of the temporary
taking, to terminate this Lease as to the affected Leased Property of the date
set forth in such Notice, and Lessor shall be entitled to any Award made for the
period of such temporary Taking prior to the date of termination of the Lease.
In no event shall Rent or any Additional Charges abate during the period of any
temporary Taking.

         15.5 AWARDS PAID TO FACILITY MORTGAGEE. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if any Facility Mortgagee is entitled to any Award or any
portion thereof,


                                       40
<PAGE>


under the terms of any Facility Mortgage such Award shall be applied, held
and/or disbursed in accordance with the terms of the Facility Mortgage. If the
Facility Mortgagee elects to apply the Award to the indebtedness secured by the
Facility Mortgage: (i) if the Award represents an Award for Partial Taking as
described in Section 15.3 above, Lessee shall restore the affected Facility (as
nearly as possible under the circumstances) to a complete architectural unit of
the same general character and condition as that of the Facility existing
immediately prior to such Taking; or (ii) if the Award represents an Award for a
Total Taking as described in Section 15.1 above, Lessee shall pay to Lessor an
amount equal to the Repurchase Price and Lessor shall transfer its portion of
the award and its interest in the affected Leased Property to Lessee. In any
such restoration or purchase, Lessee shall receive full credit for any portion
of any award retained by Lessor and the Facility Mortgagee.

                                   ARTICLE XVI

                       LESSOR'S RIGHTS ON EVENT OF DEFAULT

         16.1 LESSOR'S RIGHTS UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT. If an Event of Default
shall occur Lessor may terminate this Lease by giving Lessee a Notice of
Termination, and in such event, the Term shall end and all rights of Lessee
under this Lease shall cease on the Termination Date. The Notice of Termination
shall be in lieu of and not in addition to any notice required by the laws of
any State as a condition to bringing an action for possession of the Leased
Premises or to recover damages under this Lease. In addition to Lessor's right
to terminate this Lease, Lessor shall have all other rights set forth in this
Lease and all remedies available at law and in equity. Lessee shall, to the
extent permitted by law, pay as Additional Charges all costs and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Lessor, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses (whether or not litigation is commenced, and if
litigation is commenced, including fees and expenses incurred in any appeals and
post judgment Proceeding) as a result of any default of Lessee hereunder.

         16.2 CERTAIN REMEDIES. If an Event of Default shall occur, whether or
not this Lease has been terminated pursuant to Section 16.1, if required to do
so by Lessor, Lessee shall immediately surrender to Lessor the Leased Properties
to Lessor in the condition required by Section 9.1.5 and quit the same, and
Lessor may enter upon and repossess the Leased Properties by reasonable force,
any summary Proceeding, ejectment or otherwise, and may remove Lessee and all
other persons and any and all personal properties from the Leased Properties,
subject to any Legal Requirements. In addition to all other remedies set forth
or referred to in this Article XVI.

         16.3 DAMAGES. Neither (i) the termination of this Lease pursuant to
Section 16.1, (ii) the repossession of the Leased Properties, (iii) the failure
of Lessor to relet the Leased Properties, (iv) the reletting of all or any
portion thereof, nor (v) the failure of Lessor to collect or receive any rentals
due upon such any reletting, shall relieve Lessee of its liability and
obligations hereunder, all of which shall survive any such termination,
repossession or reletting. In the event this Lease is terminated by Lessor,
Lessee shall forthwith pay to Lessor all accrued and future Rent due and payable
with respect to the Leased Properties to and including the Realty


                                       41
<PAGE>


Expiration Date all of which shall become immediately due and payable, including
without limitation all interest and late charges payable under Section 3.3 with
respect to any late payment of such Rent, and all Additional Charges.

         16.4 LESSEE'S OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE. If an Event of Default occurs,
Lessor may require Lessee to purchase the Leased Properties on the first Rent
payment date occurring after the date of receipt of, or such later date as may
be specified in, a Notice from Lessor requiring such purchase. The purchase
price of the Leased Properties shall be an amount equal to the then Repurchase
Price of the Leased Properties, plus all Rent then due and payable (excluding
the installment of Base Rent due on the purchase date) as of the date of
purchase. If Lessor exercises such right, Lessor shall convey the Leased
Properties to Lessee on the date fixed therefor upon receipt of such purchase
price and this Lease shall thereupon terminate. Any purchase by Lessee of the
Leased Properties pursuant to this Section shall be credited against the damages
specified in Section 16.3.

         16.5 WAIVER. If this Lease is terminated pursuant to Section 16.1,
Lessee waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) any right of
reentry, repossession or redesignation, (ii) any right to a trial by jury in the
event of any summary Proceeding to enforce the remedies set forth in this
Article XVI, and (iii) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force
exempting property from liability for rent or for debt. Acceptance of Rent at
any time does not prejudice or remove any right of Lessor as to any right or
remedy. No course of conduct shall be held to bar Lessor from literal
enforcement of the terms of this Lease.

         16.6 APPLICATION OF FUNDS. Any payments received by Lessor under any of
the provisions of this Lease during the existence or continuance of any Event of
Default shall be applied to Lessee's obligations in the order which Lessor may
determine or as may be prescribed by law.

         16.7 BANKRUPTCY.

                  16.7.1 No Transfer. Neither Lessee's interest in this Lease,
         nor any estate hereby created in Lessee's interest nor any interest
         herein or therein, shall pass to any trustee or receiver or assignee
         for the benefit of creditors or otherwise by operation of law, except
         as may specifically be provided pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (11
         U.S.C. Section 101 et. seq.), as the same may be amended from time to
         time.

                           in addition to any other conditions or obligations

                           reimbursement of pecuniary loss within not more than
                           thirty (30) days of assumption and/or assignment;
                           (ii) the deposit of an additional amount equal to not
                           less than three (3) months' Base Rent, which amount
                           is agreed to be a necessary and appropriate deposit
                           to secure the future performance under the Lease of
                           Lessee or its assignee; (iii) the continued use of
                           the Leased Properties for the Primary Intended Use;

any payment or perform any act required to be made or performed under this
Lease, and fails to cure the same within any grace or cure period applicable
thereto, upon such Notice as may be expressly required herein (or, if Lessor
reasonably determines that the giving of such Notice would risk loss to the
Leased Properties or cause damage to Lessor, upon such Notice as is practical
under the circumstances), and without waiving or releasing any obligation of
Lessee, Lessor may make such payment or perform such act for the account and at
the expense of Lessee, and may, to the extent permitted by law, enter upon the
Leased Properties for such purpose and take all such action thereon as, in
Lessor's sole opinion, may be necessary or appropriate. No such entry shall be
deemed an eviction of Lessee. All amounts so paid by Lessor and all costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) so incurred, together with the late charge and interest provided for
in Section 3.3 thereon, shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor on demand. The
obligations of Lessee and rights of Lessor contained in this Article shall
survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

         December 31, 2000, audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public
         accountants. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material

                  balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows (i)
                  have been prepared in good faith based on the same assumptions
                  used to prepare the pro forma financial statements (which
                  assumptions are believed by Lessee and Guarantor to be
                  reasonable), (ii) are based on the best information available
                  to Lessee and Guarantor after due inquiry, (iii) present

                  long-term commitments or unrealized material losses.

                  2000, there has been no Material Adverse Change.

         to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal property
         material to its business (including the Leased Properties), except for
         minor defects in title that do not interfere with its ability to
         conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
         properties for their intended purposes. None of the properties and
         assets of Lessee or Guarantor is subject to any Encumbrance other than

         with this Lease.

                  each owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, trade names,
                  copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material
                  to its business, and the use thereof by Lessee and Guarantor
                  does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except
                  for any such infringements that, individually or in the
                  aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
                  Material Adverse Effect.

                  17.1.6 Litigation and Environmental Matters. There is no
         action, suit or Proceeding by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
         Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Lessee or Guarantor,
         threatened against or affecting Lessee or Guarantor (i) as to which
         there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that,
         if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or
         in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that
         involve this Lease or any of the other documents contemplated herein.

                           17.1.6.1 Environmental Compliance. Except with
                  respect to other matters that, individually or in the
                  aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
                  Material Adverse Effect, neither Lessee nor Guarantor (i) has
                  failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain,
                  maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval
                  required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject
                  to any liability with respect to any Environmental Law, (iii)
                  has received written notice of any claim with respect to any
                  Environmental Law or (iv) knows of any basis for any
                  violations of any Environmental Law or any release, threatened
                  release or exposure to any Hazardous Materials that is likely
                  to form the basis of any liability under any Environmental
                  Law.

                  17.1.7 Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Lessee and
         Guarantor each is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders
         of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all
         indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its
         property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
         aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  17.1.8 Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither Lessee
         or Guarantor is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject

                  17.1.9 Taxes. Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG each has timely
         filed or caused to be filed all tax returns and reports required to
         have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all taxes required to
         have been paid by or with respect to it, except (a) taxes that are
         being contested in good faith by an appropriate Proceeding and for
         which Lessee or Guarantor, as applicable, has set aside on its books
         adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could
         not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  17.1.10 ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
         expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
         Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could
         reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The
         present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan
         (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
         Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
         financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than
         $25,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
         present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded
         Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of
         Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the
         most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by
         more than $25,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of all such
         underfunded Plans.

                  17.1.11 Disclosure. Lessee and Guarantor have disclosed to
         the Lessor all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
         restrictions to which Lessee or Guarantor is subject, and all other
         matters known to any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
         None of the reports, financial statements, certificates or other
         information furnished by or on behalf of Lessee or Guarantor in
         connection with the negotiation of this Lease or delivered hereunder
         (as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished)
         contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any
         material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
         the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided
         that, with respect to projected financial information, Lessee and
         Guarantor represent only that such information was prepared in good
         faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

                  17.1.12 Insurance. As of the Effective Date, all premiums in
         respect of all insurance described in Article XIII have been paid.

                  17.1.13 Labor Matters. As of the Effective Date, there are no
         strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against Lessee or Guarantor pending or,
         to the knowledge of Lessee or Guarantor, threatened. The hours worked
         by and payments made to employees of Lessee and Guarantor have not been
         in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable
         Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters. All
         payments due from Lessee or Guarantor, or for which any claim may be
         made against Lessee or Guarantor, on account of wages and employee
         health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or
         accrued as a liability on the books of Lessee or Guarantor. The
         execution of this Lease has not and will not give rise to any right of
         termination or


                                       46
<PAGE>


         right of renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective
         bargaining agreement by which Lessee or Guarantor is bound.

                  17.1.14 Solvency. Immediately after the Effective Date and
         immediately following the purchase of the Leased Properties by Lessor
         pursuant to the Purchase Agreement made on the Effective Date and after
         giving effect to the application of the Purchase Price, (a) the fair
         value of the assets of Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG will exceed its debts
         and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present
         fair saleable value of the property of Lessee, Guarantor and WCG will
         be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
         liability of its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent
         or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and
         matured; (c) Lessee, Guarantor, and WCG each will be able to pay its
         debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
         debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) Lessee,
         Guarantor, and WCG each will not have unreasonably small capital with
         which to conduct the business in which it is engaged as such business
         is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the
         Effective Date.

                  17.1.15 No Burdensome Restrictions. No contract, lease,
         agreement or other instrument to which Lessee or Guarantor is a party
         or by which any of its property is bound or affected, no charge,
         corporate restriction, judgment, decree or order and no provision of
         applicable law or governmental regulation could reasonably be expected
         to have Material Adverse Effect.

                  17.1.16 Representations True and Correct. As of the dates when
         made and as of the Effective Date, each representation and warranty of
         Lessee or Guarantor thereto contained in the Purchase Agreement, this
         Lease or any other documents executed in connection herewith, is true
         and correct.

                                  ARTICLE XVIII

                       OCCUPANCY AFTER EXPIRATION OF TERM

         18.1 HOLDING OVER. If Lessee remains in possession of all or any of the
Leased Properties after the expiration of the Term or earlier termination of
this Lease, such possession shall be as a month-to-month tenant, and throughout
the period of such possession Lessee shall pay as Rent for each month one
hundred fifty percent (150%) times the sum of: (i) one-twelfth (1/12th) of the
Base Rent payable during the Lease Year in which such expiration or termination
occurs, plus (ii) all Additional Charges accruing during the month, plus (iii)
any and all other sums payable by Lessee pursuant to this Lease. During such
period of month-to-month tenancy, Lessee shall be obligated to perform and
observe all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease, but shall have
no rights hereunder other than the right, to the extent given by applicable law
to month-to-month tenancies, to continue its occupancy and use of the Leased
Properties until the month-to-month tenancy is terminated. Nothing contained
herein shall constitute the consent, express or implied, of Lessor to the
holding over of Lessee after the expiration or earlier termination of this
Lease.

         18.2 INDEMNITY. If Lessee fails to surrender the Leased Properties in a
timely manner and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.1.5 upon the
expiration or termination of this Lease, in addition to any other liabilities to
Lessor accruing therefrom, Lessee shall defend, indemnify and hold Lessor, its
principals, officers, directors, agents and employees harmless from loss or
liability resulting from such failure, including, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, loss of rental with respect to any new lease in
which the rental payable thereunder exceeds the Rent paid by Lessee pursuant to
this Lease during Lessee's hold-over and any claims by any proposed new tenant
founded on such failure. The provisions of this Section 18.2 shall survive the
expiration or termination of this Lease.

                                   ARTICLE XIX

                          SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT

         19.1 SUBORDINATION. Upon written request of Lessor, any Facility
Mortgagee, or the beneficiary of any deed of trust of Lessor, Lessee will enter
into a written agreement subordinating its rights pursuant to this Lease (i) to
the lien of any mortgage, deed of trust or the interest of any lease in which
Lessor is the lessee and to all modifications, extensions, substitutions thereof
(or, at Lessor's option, agree to the subordination to this Lease of the lien of
said mortgage, deed of trust or the interest of any lease in which Lessor is the
lessee), and (ii) to all advances made or hereafter to be made thereunder. In
connection with any such request, Lessor shall provide Lessee with a
"Non-Disturbance Agreement" reasonably acceptable to such mortgagee, beneficiary
or lessor providing that if such mortgagee, beneficiary or lessor acquires the
Leased Properties by way of foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure, such
mortgagee, beneficiary or lessor will not disturb Lessee's possession under this
Lease and will recognize Lessee's rights hereunder if and for so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. Lessee agrees to consent to
amend this Lease as reasonably required by the Facility Mortgagee, and shall be
deemed to have unreasonably withheld or delayed its consent if the required
changes do not materially (i) alter the economic terms of this Lease, (ii)
diminish the rights of Lessee, or (iii) increase the obligations of Lessee,
provided that Lessee shall also have received the non-disturbance agreement
provided for in this Article.

         19.2 ATTORNMENT. If any Proceeding is brought for foreclosure, or if
the power of sale is exercised under any mortgage or deed of trust made by
Lessor encumbering the Leased Properties, or if a lease in which Lessor is the
lessee is terminated, Lessee shall attorn to the purchaser or lessor under such
lease upon any foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof, sale or lease termination
and recognize the purchaser or lessor as Lessor under this Lease, provided the
purchaser or lessor acquires and accepts the Leased Properties subject to this
Lease.

         19.3 LESSEE'S CERTIFICATE. Lessee shall, upon not less than ten (10)
days prior Notice from Lessor, execute, acknowledge and deliver to Lessor,
Lessee's Certificate containing then-current facts. It is intended that any
Lessee's Certificate delivered pursuant hereto may be relied upon by Lessor, any
prospective tenant or purchaser of the Leased Properties, any mortgagee or
prospective mortgagee, and by any other party who may reasonably rely on such


                                       48

statement. Lessee's failure to deliver the Lessee's Certificate within such time
shall constitute an Event of Default. In addition, Lessee hereby authorizes
Lessor to execute and deliver a certificate to the effect (if true) that Lessee
represents and warrants that (i) this Lease is in full force and effect without
modification, and (ii) Lessor is not in breach or default of any of its
obligations under this Lease.

                                   ARTICLE XX

                                  RISK OF LOSS

         20.1 RISK OF LOSS. During the Term, the risk of loss or of decrease in
the enjoyment and beneficial use of the Leased Properties in consequence of the
damage or destruction thereof by fire, the elements, casualties, thefts, riots,
wars or otherwise, or in consequence of foreclosures, attachments, levies or
executions is assumed by Lessee, and, in the absence of gross negligence,
willful misconduct or material breach of this Lease by Lessor, Lessor shall in
no event be answerable or accountable therefor nor shall any of the events
mentioned in this Article XX entitle Lessee to any abatement of Rent.

                                   ARTICLE XXI

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         21.1 INDEMNIFICATION. Notwithstanding the existence of any insurance or
self-insurance provided for in Article XIII, and without regard to the policy
limits of any such insurance or self-insurance, Lessee shall protect, indemnify,
save harmless and defend Lessor, its principals, officers, directors, agents,
employees, parents, and affiliates from and against all liabilities,
obligations, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), to the
extent permitted by law, imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against Lessor
by reason of: (i) any accident, injury to or death of persons or loss of or
damage to property occurring on or about the Leased Properties or adjoining
sidewalks, including without limitation any claims of malpractice, (ii) any use,
misuse, non-use, condition, maintenance or repair by Lessee of the Leased
Properties, (iii) the failure to pay any Impositions, (iv) any failure on the
part of Lessee to perform or comply with any of the terms of this Lease, and (v)
the nonperformance of any contractual obligation, express or implied, assumed or
undertaken by Lessee or any party in privity with Lessee with respect to the
Leased Properties or any business or other activity carried on with respect to
the Leased Properties during the Term or thereafter during any time in which
Lessee or any such other party is in possession of the Leased Properties or
thereafter to the extent that any conduct by Lessee or any such person (or
failure of such conduct thereby if the same should have been undertaken during
such time of possession and leads to such damage or loss) causes such loss or
claim. Any amounts which become payable by Lessee under this Section shall be
paid within ten (10) days after liability therefor on the part of Lessee is
determined by litigation or otherwise, and if not timely paid, shall bear
interest (to the extent permitted by law) at the Overdue Rate from the date of
such determination to the date of payment. Nothing herein shall be construed as
indemnifying Lessor against its own grossly negligent acts or omissions or
willful misconduct.


                                       49

Lessee's liability under this Article shall survive the expiration or any
earlier termination of this Lease.

                                  ARTICLE XXII

                            RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS

         22.1 GENERAL PROHIBITION AGAINST TRANSFERS. Lessee acknowledges that a
significant inducement to Lessor to enter into this Lease with Lessee on the
terms set forth herein is the combination of financial strength, experience,
skill and reputation possessed by the Lessee named herein, the Person or Persons
in Control of Lessee and Guarantor, together with Lessee's assurance that Lessor
shall have the unrestricted right to approve or disapprove any proposed
Transfer. Therefore, there shall be no Transfer except as specifically permitted
by this Lease or consented to in advance by Lessor in writing. Lessee agrees
that Lessor shall have the right to withhold its consent to any proposed
Transfer on the basis of Lessor's judgment as to the effect the proposed
Transfer may have on the Leased Properties and the future performance of the
obligations of the Lessee under this Lease, whether or not Lessee agrees with
such judgment. Any attempted Transfer which is not specifically permitted by
this Lease or consented to by Lessor in advance in writing shall be null and
void and of no force and effect whatsoever. In the event of a Transfer, Lessor
may collect Rent and other charges from the assignee, subtenant or other
occupant or transferee (any and all of which are herein referred to as a
"Transferee") and apply the amounts collected to the Rent and other charges
herein reserved, but no Transfer or collection of Rent and other charges shall
be deemed to be a waiver of Lessor's rights to enforce Lessee's covenants or an
acceptance of the Transferee as Lessee, or a release of the Lessee named herein
from the performance of its covenants. Notwithstanding any Transfer, Lessee and
Guarantor shall remain fully liable for the performance of all terms, covenants
and provisions of this Lease. Any violation of this Lease by any Transferee
shall be deemed to be a violation of this Lease by Lessee.

         22.2 CONSENT TO CERTAIN TRANSFERS. Lessor acknowledges that Lessee, as
sublessor, intends to enter into subleases with the parties identified on
SCHEDULE 22.2, as sublessees, with respect to the Facilities identified on such
Schedule. Lessor consents to such subleases provided that all such sublease
agreements satisfy all of the requirements set forth in this Lease and otherwise
are satisfactory in form and substance to Lessor. The conditions set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed satisfied as to any sublease
with respect to which Lessor has executed and delivered a Consent and
Non-Disturbance Agreement in substantially the form of EXHIBIT F.
Notwithstanding any such sublease, Lessee and Guarantor shall remain fully
liable for the performance of all terms, covenants and provisions of this Lease.

         22.3 SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT. Lessee shall insert in any sublease
permitted by Lessor provisions to the effect that (i) such sublease is subject
and subordinate to all of the terms and provisions of this Lease and to the
rights of Lessor hereunder, (ii) if this Lease terminates before the expiration
of such sublease, the sublessee thereunder will, at Lessor's option, attorn to
Lessor and waive any right the sublessee may have to terminate the sublease or
to surrender possession thereunder, as a result of the termination of this
Lease, and (iii) if the


                                       50
<PAGE>


sublessee receives a written Notice from Lessor or Lessor's assignee, if any,
stating that Lessee is in default under this Lease, the sublessee shall
thereafter be obligated to pay all rentals accruing under the sublease directly
to the party giving such Notice, or as such party may direct, which payments
shall be credited against the amounts owing by Lessee under this Lease.

authorized representatives to inspect the Leased Properties and Lessee's books

<PAGE>


foregoing, Lessee is and shall be in exclusive control and possession of the
Leased Properties as provided herein, and Lessor shall not in any event
whatsoever be liable for any injury or damage to any property or to any person
happening on or about the Leased Properties nor for any injury or damage to any
property of Lessee, or of any other person, except in the event any such injury
or damage is the direct result of the gross negligence or malfeasance of Lessor.
The right of Lessor to enter and inspect the Leased Properties are for the
purpose of enabling Lessor to be informed as to whether or not Lessee is
complying with the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease and to do such
acts as Lessee may have failed to do, provided however, in no event shall Lessor
have any obligation whatsoever to so perform such acts.

                                   ARTICLE XXV

                                    NO WAIVER

         25.1 NO WAIVER. No failure by Lessor to insist upon the strict
performance of any term hereof or to exercise any right, power or remedy
consequent upon a breach hereof, and no acceptance of full or partial payment of
Rent during the continuance of any such breach, shall constitute a waiver of any
such breach or of any such term. No waiver of any breach shall affect or alter
this Lease, which shall continue in full force and effect with respect to any
other then existing or subsequent breach.

                                  ARTICLE XXVI

         26.1 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. To the extent permitted by law, each legal,
equitable or contractual right, power and remedy of Lessor now or hereafter
provided either in this Lease or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power and remedy and
the exercise or beginning of the exercise by Lessor of any one or more of such
rights, powers and remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or subsequent
exercise by Lessor of any or all of such other rights, powers and remedies.

                                  ARTICLE XXVII

                                    SURRENDER

         27.1 ACCEPTANCE OF SURRENDER. No surrender to Lessor of this Lease or
of the Leased Properties or any part thereof, or of any interest therein, shall
be valid or effective unless agreed to and accepted in writing by Lessor, and no
act by Lessor or any representative or agent of Lessor, other than such a
written acceptance by Lessor, shall constitute an acceptance of any such
surrender.

         28.1 NO MERGER OF TITLE. There shall be no merger of this Lease or of
the leasehold estate created hereby by reason of the fact that the same person,
firm, corporation or other entity may acquire, own or hold, directly or
indirectly, (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate created hereby or any
interest in this Lease or such leasehold estate, and (ii) the fee estate in the
Leased Properties.

         28.2 NO PARTNERSHIP. Nothing contained in this Lease will be deemed or
construed to create a partnership or joint venture between Lessor and Lessee or
to cause either party to be responsible in any way for the debts or obligations
of the other or any other party, it being the intention of the parties that the
only relationship hereunder is that of Lessor and Lessee.

                                  ARTICLE XXIX

         29.1 CONVEYANCE BY LESSOR. Lessor may at its sole option, transfer the
Leased Properties and in connection with any such transfer, may assign this
Lease. If Lessor or any successor owner of the Leased Properties conveys the
Leased Properties other than as security for a debt, Lessor or such successor
owner, as the case may be, shall thereupon be released from all future
liabilities and obligations of Lessor under this Lease arising or accruing from
and after the date of such conveyance or other transfer and all such future
liabilities and obligations shall thereupon be binding upon the new owner.


                                   ARTICLE XXX

                                 QUIET ENJOYMENT

         30.1 QUIET ENJOYMENT. So long as Lessee pays all Rent as it becomes due
and complies with all of the terms of this Lease and performs its obligations
hereunder, Lessee shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy the Leased
Properties for the Term, free of any claim or other action by Lessor or anyone
claiming by, through or under Lessor, but subject to all liens and Encumbrances
of record as of the date hereof or hereafter provided for in this Lease or
consented to by Lessee. Except as otherwise provided in this Lease, no failure
by Lessor to comply with the foregoing covenant will give Lessee any right to
cancel or terminate this Lease or abate, reduce or make a deduction from or
offset against the Rent or any other sum payable under this Lease, or to fail to
perform any other obligation of Lessee. Lessee shall, however, have the right,
by separate and independent action, to pursue any claim it may have against
Lessor as a result of a breach by Lessor of the covenant of quiet enjoyment
contained in this Section.

                           LESSOR'S OPTION TO PURCHASE

         34.1 LESSOR'S OPTION TO PURCHASE LESSEE'S PERSONAL PROPERTY. Unless
Lessee purchases the Leased Properties as provided in this Lease, upon the
expiration or termination of this Lease, Lessor shall have the option on the
terms hereinafter set forth to purchase any of Lessee's Personal Property that
is not deemed to have been sold, assigned, transferred and conveyed to Lessor
pursuant to Section 6.3 hereof, for an amount equal to the then book value
thereof (acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation on the books of Lessee
pertaining thereto), subject to, and with appropriate credits for, any
obligations owing from Lessee to Lessor and for the then outstanding balances
owing on all equipment leases, conditional sale contracts and any other
Encumbrances to which such Lessee's Personal Property is subject. Lessor's
option shall be exercised by Notice to Lessee no more than one hundred eighty
(180) days, nor less than ninety (90) days, before the expiration of the Realty
Term, unless this Lease is terminated prior to its expiration date by reason of
an Event of Default, in which event Lessor's option shall be exercised not more
than ninety (90) days after the date of


                                       57
<PAGE>


termination. Lessor's option shall terminate upon Lessee's purchase of the
Leased Properties. If Lessee does not receive Lessor's Notice exercising its
option before the expiration of the relevant time period, Lessee shall give
Lessor Notice thereof and Lessor's option shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of thirty (30) days after such Notice from Lessee. If Lessor
exercises its option, Lessee shall, in exchange for Lessor's payment of the
purchase price, deliver the purchased Lessee's Personal Property to Lessor,
together with a bill of sale and such other documents as Lessor may reasonably
request in order to carry out the purchase, and the purchase shall be closed by
such delivery and such payment on the date set by Lessor in its Notice of
exercise. Lessor shall be responsible for applicable sales, use and other
similar taxes which are assessed on the sale of Lessee's Personal Property to
Lessor.

         34.2 LEASED PROPERTIES TRADE NAME. If this Lease is terminated pursuant
to Section 16.1 or Lessor exercises its option to purchase Lessee's Personal
Property pursuant to Section 34.1, Lessee shall be deemed to have assigned to
Lessor the exclusive right to use Leased Properties Trade Name in perpetuity.

         34.3 TRANSFER OF OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE FACILITIES. Lessee shall
cooperate fully in transferring operational control of all of the Facilities
which are then subject to this Lease to Lessor or Lessor's nominee if the Term
expires without renewal or this Lease is terminated upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default or for any other reason, and Lessee shall use its best efforts
to cause the business conducted at all such Facilities to continue without
interruption. To that end, pending completion of the transfer of the operational
control of such Facilities to Lessor or its nominee:

                  34.3.1 Employees. Lessee will not terminate the employment of
         any Leased Properties maintenance and operations employees without just
         cause, or change any salaries, provided, however, that without the
         advance written consent of Lessor, Lessee may grant pre-announced wage
         increases of which Lessor has knowledge, increases required by written
         employment agreements and normal raises to non-officers at regular
         review dates; and Lessee will not hire any additional employees except
         in good faith in the ordinary course of business;

                  34.3.2 Change in Control. Lessee will provide all necessary
         information requested by Lessor or its nominee for the preparation and
         filing of any and all necessary applications or notifications of any
         federal or state governmental authority having jurisdiction over a
         change in the operational control of the Facilities, and any other
         information reasonably required to effect an orderly transfer of the
         Facilities;

                  34.3.3 Business and Organization. Lessee shall use all
         reasonable efforts to keep the business and organization of the
         Facilities intact and to preserve for Lessor or its nominee the
         goodwill of the suppliers, distributors, residents and others having
         business relations with Lessee with respect to the Facilities;

                  34.3.4 Operations in Ordinary Course. Lessee shall engage only
         in transactions or other activities with respect to the Facilities
         which are in the ordinary course of its


                                       58
<PAGE>


         business and shall perform all maintenance and repairs reasonably
         necessary to keep the Facilities in satisfactory operating condition
         and repair;

                  34.3.5 Employee Benefits. Lessee shall provide Lessor or its
         nominee with full and complete information regarding the employees of
         the Facilities and shall reimburse Lessor or its nominee for all
         outstanding accrued employee benefits, including accrued vacation, sick
         and holiday pay calculated on a true accrual basis, including all
         earned and a prorated portion of all unearned benefits;

                  34.3.6 Third Party Consents. Lessee shall use all reasonable
         efforts to obtain the acknowledgment and the consent of any creditor,
         lessor or sublessor, mortgagee, beneficiary of a deed of trust or
         security agreement affecting the real and personal properties of Lessee
         or any other party whose acknowledgment and/or consent would be
         required because of a change in the operational control of the
         Facilities and transfer of personal property. The consent must be in
         form, scope and substance satisfactory to Lessor or its nominee,
         including, without limitation, an acknowledgment in respect to all such
         contracts, leases, deeds of trust, mortgage, security agreements, or
         other agreements that Lessee and all predecessors or
         successors-in-interest thereto are not in default in respect thereto,
         that no condition known to the consenting party exists which with the
         giving of notice or lapse of time would result in such a default, and,
         if requested, affirmatively consenting to the change in the operational
         control of the Facilities;

                  34.3.7 Lessor as Attorney-in-Fact. To more fully preserve and
         protect Lessor's rights under this Section, Lessee does hereby make,
         constitute and appoint Lessor its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, for
         it and in its name, place and stead to execute and deliver all such
         instruments and documents, and to do all such other acts and things, as
         Lessor may deem to be necessary or desirable to protect and preserve
         the rights granted under this Section. Lessee hereby grants to Lessor
         the full power and authority to appoint one or more substitutes to
         perform any of the acts that Lessor is authorized to perform under this
         Section, with a right to revoke such appointment of substitution at
         Lessor's pleasure. The power of attorney granted pursuant to this
         Section is coupled with an interest and therefore is irrevocable. Any
         person dealing with Lessor may rely upon the representation of Lessor
         relating to any authority granted by this power of attorney, including
         the intended scope of the authority, and may accept the written
         certificate of Lessor that this power of attorney is in full force and
         effect. Photographic or other facsimile reproductions of this executed
         Lease may be made and delivered by Lessor, and may be relied upon by
         any person to the same extent as though the copy were an original.
         Anyone who acts in reliance upon any representation or certificate of
         Lessor, or upon a reproduction of this Lease, shall not be liable for
         permitting Lessor to perform any act pursuant to this power of
         attorney. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor covenants with Lessee
         that Lessor shall refrain from exercising the power of attorney granted
         hereby except in the case of an Event of Default hereunder or in the
         event of a default, which, in Lessor's reasonable judgment, may lead to
         the suspension or revocation of any license of Lessee or of any
         sublessee.

         34.4 INTANGIBLES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Lease but subject to Articles 40 or 41 relating to the
security interest in favor of Lessor, Leased Personal Property shall not include
goodwill nor shall it include any other intangible personal property that is
severable from Lessor's " interests in real property" within the meaning of
Section 856(d) of the Code, or any similar or successor provision thereto.

                                  ARTICLE XXXV

                             [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED]


                                  ARTICLE XXXVI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         36.1 COMPLIANCE WITH FACILITY MORTGAGE. Lessee covenants and agrees
that it will duly and punctually observe, perform and comply with all of the
terms, covenants and conditions (including, without limitation, covenants
requiring the keeping of books and records and delivery of Financial Statements
and other information) of any Facility Mortgage and that it will not directly or
indirectly, do any act or suffer or permit any condition or thing to occur,
which would or might constitute a default under a Facility Mortgage. Anything in
this Lease to the contrary notwithstanding, if the time for performance of any
act required of Lessee by the terms of a Facility Mortgage is shorter than the
time allowed by this Lease for performance of such act by Lessee, then Lessee
shall perform such act within the time limits specified in such Facility
Mortgage.

         36.2 SURVIVAL, CHOICE OF LAW. Anything contained in this Lease to the
contrary notwithstanding, all claims against, and liabilities of, Lessee or
Lessor arising prior to the date of expiration or termination of this Lease
shall survive such expiration or termination. If any term or provision of this
Lease or any application thereof is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder
of this Lease and any other application of such term or provisions shall not be
affected thereby. Neither this Lease nor any provision hereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated except by an instrument in writing and in
recordable form signed by Lessor and Lessee. All the terms and provisions of
this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. The headings in this Lease are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
meaning hereof. This Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State, except as to matters which, under applicable procedural
conflicts of laws rules require the application of laws of another State.

         LESSEE CONSENTS TO IN PERSONAM JURISDICTION BEFORE THE STATE AND
FEDERAL COURTS OF THE STATES OF OKLAHOMA AND AGREES THAT ALL DISPUTES CONCERNING
THIS LEASE BE HEARD IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF
OKLAHOMA. LESSEE AGREES THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE EFFECTED UPON IT UNDER
ANY METHOD PERMISSIBLE


                                       60
<PAGE>


UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO
VENUE IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.

         36.3 LIMITATION ON RECOVERY. Lessee specifically agrees to look solely
to Lessor's interest in the Leased Properties for recovery of any judgment from
Lessor, it being specifically agreed that no constituent shareholder, officer or
director of Lessor shall ever be personally liable for any such judgment or for
the payment of any monetary obligation to Lessee. Furthermore, Lessor (original
or successor) shall never be liable to Lessee for any indirect, consequential,
special or punitive damages suffered by Lessee from whatever cause.

         36.4 WAIVERS. Lessee waives any defense by reason of any disability of
Lessee, and waives any other defense based on the termination of Lessee's
(including Lessee's successor's) liability from any cause. Lessee waives all
presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor, and notices of acceptance, and waives
all notices of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional
obligations.

         36.5 CONSENTS. Whenever the consent or approval of Lessor is required
hereunder, Lessor may in its sole discretion and without reason withhold that
consent or approval unless otherwise specifically provided.

         36.6 COUNTERPARTS. This Lease may be executed in separate counterparts,
each of which shall be considered an original when each party has executed and
delivered to the other one or more copies of this Lease.

         36.7 RIGHTS CUMULATIVE. Except as provided herein to the contrary, the
respective rights and remedies of the parties specified in this Lease shall be
cumulative and in addition to any rights and remedies not specified in this
Lease.

         36.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. There are no oral or written agreements or
representations between the parties hereto affecting this Lease. This Lease
supersedes and cancels any and all previous negotiations, arrangements,
representations, brochures, agreements and understandings, if any, between
Lessor and Lessee.

         36.9 AMENDMENTS IN WRITING. No provision of this Lease may be amended
except by an agreement in writing signed by Lessor and Lessee.

         36.10 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Lease or the application
of such provision to any person, entity or circumstance is found invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such determination shall not
affect the other provisions of this Lease and all other provisions of this Lease
shall be deemed valid and enforceable.

         36.11 ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE. At any time and from time to time, Lessee
shall, without charge, within ten (10) days after request by Lessor, certify by
a written instrument executed and acknowledged by a duly authorized
representative of Lessee, addressed to Lessor


                                       61
<PAGE>


and any mortgagee or purchaser, or proposed mortgagee or proposed purchaser, or
any other party, firm or corporation specified by Lessor, as to the validity and
status of this Lease, as to the existence of any default on the part of any
party hereunder, as to the existence of any offsets, counterclaims, or defenses
thereto which may be alleged on the part of Lessee, and as to any other matters
which may be reasonably requested by Lessor.

         36.12 TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Except for the delivery of possession of the
Facilities to Lessee, time is of the essence of all provisions of this Lease of
which time is an element.

         36.13 LESSOR'S COSTS AND EXPENSES. Lessee shall be responsible for and
shall pay on demand by Lessor, all of Lessor's reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Lease,
including without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of Lessor's
attorneys.

                                 ARTICLE XXXVII

                                     BROKERS

         37.1 COMMISSIONS. Lessee represents and warrants to Lessor that no real
estate commission, finder's fee or the like is due and owing to any person in
connection with this Lease. Lessee agrees to save, indemnify and hold Lessor
harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities or obligations for
brokerage, finder's fees or the like in connection with this Lease or the
transactions contemplated hereby, asserted by any person on the basis of any
statement or act alleged to have been made or taken by Lessee.

                                  ARTICLE XVIII

                               MEMORANDUM OF LEASE

         38.1 MEMORANDUM OR SHORT FORM OF LEASE. Lessor and Lessee shall,
promptly upon the request of either, enter into a Memorandum or Short Form of
Lease, substantially in the form of EXHIBIT G with such modifications as may be
appropriate under the laws and customs of the States and in the customary form
suitable for recording under the laws of each of the States. Lessee shall pay
all costs and expenses of recording such memorandum or short form of this Lease.

                                  ARTICLE XXXIX

                               RECHARACTERIZATION

         39.1 RECHARACTERIZATION AS A SECURITY DOCUMENT. In the event that
notwithstanding the intent of Lessor, Lessee and Guarantor as set forth herein,
that this Lease be treated as a true lease for purposes of the UCC and other
applicable laws of the State, a court of competent jurisdiction recharacterizes
this Lease as a security document serving as collateral for a financing, the
additional provisions set forth in Article XL and Article XLI shall apply,


                                       62
<PAGE>


provided however, such application shall in no event otherwise diminish,
restrict or eliminate any of the Lessor's rights or remedies set forth in this
Lease or in any of the other documents executed in connection herewith, all of
the foregoing to remain in full force and effect for all purposes.

                                   ARTICLE XL

                             GRANT OF MORTGAGE LIEN

         40.1 GRANT OF LIEN AND SECURITY INTEREST; ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS. To
secure to the Lessor the performance by the Lessee of its covenants, agreements
and obligations under the Lease, Lessee hereby agrees as follows:

                  40.1.1 Mortgage. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
         Lease, and in addition to all other rights and remedies of Lessor as
         contained herein or under applicable law, the Lessee does hereby
         mortgage, pledge, grant, bargain, sell, convey, assign, warrant,
         transfer and set over to the Lessor, WITH POWER OF SALE, to the extent
         permitted by applicable law: (i) all of the Lessee's right, title and
         interest, if any, in the Leased Properties, and (ii) all of the
         Lessee's right, title and interest in and to all proceeds of the
         conversion, whether voluntary or involuntary, of any of the
         above-described property into cash or other liquid claims, including,
         without limitation, all awards, payments or proceeds, including
         interest thereon, and the right to receive the same, which may be made
         as a result of casualty, any exercise of the right of eminent domain or
         deed in lieu thereof, the alteration of the grade of any street and any
         injury to or decrease in the value thereof, the foregoing collectively
         being referred to hereinafter as the "Security Property".

         TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the foregoing rights, interests and properties, and
         all rights, estates, powers and privileges appurtenant thereto, unto
         the Lessor, its successors and assigns, forever, for the uses and
         purposes herein expressed, but not otherwise.

                  40.1.2 Security Interest. Subject to the terms and conditions
         of the Lease, the Lessee hereby grants to the Lessor a security
         interest in the Lessee's interest, if any, in that portion of the
         Security Property (the "UCC Property") subject to the Uniform
         Commercial Code of the state in which the Leased Properties are located
         (the "UCC"). This Lease shall also be deemed to be a security agreement
         and a financing statement filed as a fixture filing pursuant to 12A
         O.S. Section 1-9-502 and shall support any financing statement showing
         the Lessor's interest as a secured party with respect to any portion of
         the UCC Property described in such financing statement. The Lessee
         agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to execute, deliver and file from
         time to time such further instruments as may be requested by the Lessor
         to confirm and perfect the lien of the security interest in the
         collateral described in this Lease.

                  40.1.3 Assignment of Leases and Rents. The Lessee hereby
         irrevocably assigns, conveys, transfers and sets over unto the Lessor
         (subject, however, to the Lease and the


                                       63
<PAGE>


         rights of the Lessee thereunder and hereunder) all and every part of
         the rents, issues and profits that may from time to time become due and
         payable on account of any and all subleases or other occupancy
         agreements now existing, or that may hereafter come into existence with
         respect to the Leased Properties or any part thereof, including any
         guaranties of such subleases or other occupancy agreements. Upon
         request of the Lessor, the Lessee shall execute and cause to be
         recorded, at its expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
         subleases or other occupancy agreements, of the Leased Properties. Upon
         the occurrence and continuance of a Event of Default, the Lessor is
         hereby fully authorized and empowered in its discretion (in addition to
         all other powers and rights herein granted), and subject to the Lease
         and the rights of the Lessee thereunder and hereunder, to apply for and
         collect and receive all such rents, issues and profits and to enforce
         any guaranty or guaranties, and all money so received under and by
         virtue of this assignment shall be held and applied as further security
         for the payment of the indebtedness secured hereby and to assure the
         performance by the Lessee of its covenants, agreements and obligations
         under the Lease.

         40.2 REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default:

                  40.2.1 Power of Sale Foreclosure. The Lessor shall have the
         power and authority, to the extent provided by law, after proper notice
         and lapse of such time as may be required by the Oklahoma Power of Sale
         Mortgage Foreclosure Act, 46 O.S. Section 40-49, as amended from time
         to time (the "Act"), to sell the Security Property at the time and
         place of sale fixed by the Lessor in said notice of sale, either as a
         whole, or in separate lots or parcels and in such order as the Lessor
         may elect, at auction to the highest bidder for cash in lawful money of
         the United States payable at the time of sale, all in accordance with
         the Act and any other applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which the
         Leased Properties are located, it being acknowledged that A POWER OF
         SALE HAS BEEN GRANTED IN THIS INSTRUMENT. A POWER OF SALE MAY ALLOW THE
         LESSOR TO TAKE THE SECURITY PROPERTY AND SELL IT WITHOUT GOING TO COURT
         IN A FORECLOSURE ACTION UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUANCE OF AN EVENT
         OF DEFAULT BY THE LESSEE.

                  40.2.2 Judicial Foreclosure. The Lessor may proceed by a suit
         or suits in equity or at law, whether for a foreclosure hereunder, or
         for the sale of the Security Property, or, subject to the terms and
         conditions of the Lease, against the Lessee for the Rent, or for the
         specific performance of any covenant or agreement herein contained or
         in aid of the execution of any power herein granted, or for the
         appointment of a receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder or the sale
         of the Security Property, or for the enforcement of any other
         appropriate legal or equitable remedy.

                  40.2.3 Appointment of Receiver. Without regard to the Lessor's
         election of nonjudicial power of sale foreclosure or judicial
         foreclosure, the Lessor shall be entitled to the appointment of a
         receiver by any court of competent jurisdiction, without notice and
         without regard to the sufficiency or value of any security for the
         indebtedness secured hereby or the solvency of any party bound for its
         payment. The receiver shall have all of


                                       64
<PAGE>


         the rights and powers permitted under the laws of the state within
         which the Leased Properties are located.

                  40.2.4 Waiver of Appraisement Appraisement of the Leased
         Properties is hereby waived or not waived at the option of the Lessor,
         such option to be exercised at or prior to the time judgment is
         rendered in any judicial foreclosure.

                  40.2.5 Additional Remedies. It is the intent of the parties
         hereto that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
         Default, the Lessor shall have the remedies provided for in this
         Section 40.2; provided, however, that (i) in lieu of the remedies
         provided for in this Lease, the Lessor, at its election, may require
         the Lessee to purchase the Leased Properties and, in the event that the
         Lessee purchases the Leased Properties as provided in Section 16.4 of
         this Lease, the remedies set forth herein shall not be available to the
         Lessor with respect to such Event of Default, and (ii) in the event
         that, notwithstanding the intention of the parties, a court of
         competent jurisdiction determines that the remedies in this Section
         40.2 are unenforceable, the Lessor shall have, as a result of such
         determination, in lieu of the remedies in this Section 40.2, any and
         all of the other remedies provided for in Article 16 of this Lease. To
         the extent not in conflict with applicable law or the Lessee's
         obligations thereunder, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
         provisions of 11 U.S.C. Section 502(b)(6) are not applicable to the
         transactions contemplated by this Lease.

                  40.2.6 Cure by Purchase of Leased Properties. Notwithstanding
         anything to the contrary contained herein, the Lessee may cure any
         Event of Default affecting or relating to the Leased Properties by
         purchasing the Leased Properties as provided in Section 16.4 of this
         Lease.

         binding on any Lessee or Lessee's articles or certificate of
         incorporation or by-laws, partnership agreements, or operating
         agreements, as the case may be, the provisions of any indenture,
         instrument or agreement to which Lessee is a party or is subject, or by
         which it, or its property, is bound, or conflict with or constitute a
         default thereunder, or result in the creation or imposition of any

         the exact name as it appears in the Lessee's organizational documents,
         as amended, as filed with the Lessee's jurisdiction of organization.

                  41.2.7 No Financing Statements. No financing statement
         describing all or any portion of the Collateral which has not lapsed or
         been terminated naming the Lessee as debtor has been filed in any
         jurisdiction except (i) financing statements naming the Lessor as the
         secured party, and (ii) as permitted by Section 41.3.6. None of the

         reasonable times and intervals as the Lessor may determine, and all at

         good faith by appropriate Proceedings and with respect to which no
         Encumbrance exists.

                  41.3.3 Records and Reports; Notification of Default. Lessee

         time to time be requested by the Lessor in order to maintain a first
         perfected security interest in and, if applicable, control of, the
         Collateral. Lessee and Guarantor will take any and all actions
         necessary to defend title to the Collateral against all persons and to
         defend the security interest of the Lessor in the Collateral and the
         priority thereof against any Encumbrance not expressly permitted
         hereunder.

                  41.3.5 Disposition of Collateral. Lessee will not sell, lease
         or otherwise dispose of the Collateral except (i) prior to the
         occurrence of an Event of Default, dispositions specifically permitted
         pursuant to this Lease, (ii) until such time following the occurrence

         statement (which does not add new collateral or add a debtor) in such

         Lessor on demand for any payment made or any expense incurred by the
         Lessor in connection therewith, provided that this authorization shall
         not relieve Lessee or Guarantor of any obligations under this Lease.

                  41.6.4 Dispositions Not Authorized. Neither Lessee or
         Guarantor is authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral
         except as set forth in Section 41.3.5 and notwithstanding any course of

         the Lessor, no authorization to sell or otherwise dispose of the

the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable
Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the requested date of such
Swingline Loan.

         (c) The applicable Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on any
Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such
Business Day in all or a portion of its Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice
shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders
will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent
will give notice thereof to each


                                       31
<PAGE>


Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's Applicable Percentage
of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Swingline Lender, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Revolving
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence
and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and
that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding
or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation
under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the
same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such
Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment
obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the applicable Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it
from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower
of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph,
and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the
Administrative Agent and not to the applicable Swingline Lender. Any amounts
received by a Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of
the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan made by such Swingline Lender after
receipt by such Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations
therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts
received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their
payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the applicable Swingline Lender, as
their interests may appear. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan
pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the
payment thereof.

         SECTION 2.5. Letters of Credit. (a) General. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of
Credit for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time
to time during the Revolving Availability Period. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement
submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing
Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

         (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain
Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall
hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing
Bank from whom the Borrower is requesting such Letter of Credit and to the
Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of
Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended,
and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which
shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire
(which shall comply


                                       32
<PAGE>


with Section 2.05(c)), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address
of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the
applicable Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit
application on such Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request
for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each
Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that),
after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC
Exposure shall not exceed $350,000,000 and (ii) the total Revolving Exposures
shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

         (c) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to
the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year after the date of
the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension), provided that a
Letter of Credit may include customary "evergreen" provisions and (ii) the date
that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

         (d) Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any
further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each
Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such Issuing Bank, a participation in such
Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate
amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and
in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
such Issuing Bank, such Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by such Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as
provided in paragraph Section 2.05(e), or of any reimbursement payment required
to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and
agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph
in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default
or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall
be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

         (e) Reimbursement. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in
respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement
not later than 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the date that such LC
Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC
Disbursement prior to 9:30 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on such date, or, if such
notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date,
then not later than 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on (i) the Business Day that
the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to


                                       33
<PAGE>


9:30 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such
notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
if such LC Disbursement is not less than $5,000,000, the Borrower may, subject
to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with
Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving
Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so
financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and
replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the
Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then
due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage
thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then
due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with
respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the
amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt
by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the
applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made
payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such
Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
applicable Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR
Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not constitute
a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.



                                       34
<PAGE>


         (f) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in paragraph Section 2.05(e) shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of
Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or
other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of
Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for
the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or
provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither
the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor either Issuing Bank, nor any of their
Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in
connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment
or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission,
interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or
other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any
document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the
Issuing Bank; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an
Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by
the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when
determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that,
in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct on the part of an
Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), each
Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.
In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the
parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their
face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment
upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the
terms of such Letter of Credit.

          (g) Disbursement Procedures. The applicable Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing
Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the
Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that
any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the
Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Revolving
Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.


                                       35
<PAGE>


         (h) Interim Interest. If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in
full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall
bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is
made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC
Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to Section 2.05(e), then Section 2.13(c) shall apply. Interest accrued
pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing
Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any
Revolving Lender pursuant to Section 2.05(e) to reimburse the applicable Issuing
Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

         (i) Replacement of the Issuing Bank. An Issuing Bank may be replaced at
any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the
replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent
shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time
any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid
fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section
2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the
successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing
Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued
thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed
to refer to such successor, to any other Issuing Bank or to any previous Issuing
Bank, or to such successor, all other Issuing Banks and all previous Issuing
Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank
hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this
Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

         (j) Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater
than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral
pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the
Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the
benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 105% of the LC Exposure as of
such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the
obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately,
and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with
respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(h) or 7.01(i). Each such
deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment
and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned
on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the
option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent


                                       36
<PAGE>


and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.
Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such
account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to
reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not
been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC
Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but
subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to
provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of
an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall
be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of
Default have been cured or waived.

         SECTION 2.6. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided
in Section 2.04. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in Dallas,
Texas and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;
provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the
Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.

         (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.06(a) and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such
Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.7. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing,
Additional Incremental Revolving Borrowing, Term Borrowing, Incremental Term
Borrowing and Additional Incremental Term Borrowing initially shall be of the
Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such
Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing
to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in
this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of a Borrowing,


                                       37
<PAGE>


in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall not apply
to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

         (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall
notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a
Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were
requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be
made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

         (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.02 and Section 2.07(f):

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
         applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
         different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
         each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
         pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
         resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
         Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
         Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
         Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
         election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
         term "Interest Period".

         If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing
but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

         (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each applicable Lender of the details thereof
and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

         (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request
with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at
the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, then, so long as an Event of Default is
continuing (i) no outstanding


                                       38
<PAGE>


Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii)
unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

          (f) A Borrowing of any Class may not be converted to or continued as a
Eurodollar Borrowing if after giving effect thereto (i) the Interest Period
therefor would commence before and end after a date on which any principal of
the Loans of such Class is scheduled to be repaid and (ii) the sum of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Eurodollar Borrowings of such Class
with Interest Periods ending on or prior to such scheduled repayment date plus
the aggregate principal amount of outstanding ABR Borrowings of such Class would
be less than the aggregate principal amount of Loans of such Class required to
be repaid on such scheduled repayment date.

         SECTION 2.8. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, (i) the Term Commitments shall terminate on the Term
Commitment Termination Date, (ii) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on
the Revolving Maturity Date, (iii) the Incremental Tranche A Commitments shall
terminate on the Incremental Tranche A Commitment Termination Date and (iv) the
Additional Incremental Commitments of any Class shall terminate on the date set
forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

         (b) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08(h), the Revolving
Commitments outstanding on the Revolving Commitment Reduction Date shall be
automatically and permanently reduced in 12 consecutive installments on the last
day of each fiscal quarter (except with respect to the final reduction, which
shall be on the Revolving Maturity Date) set forth below in the percentage
amounts (expressed as a percentage of the aggregate amount of Revolving
Commitments outstanding on the Revolving Commitment Reduction Date) set forth
opposite such quarterly scheduled reduction date (or the Revolving Maturity
Date) below; provided that the final installment shall reduce the remaining
outstanding Revolving Commitments to zero on the Revolving Maturity Date and the
payment made in respect thereof shall equal the sum of (x) the then aggregate
unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loans plus (y) all other unpaid amounts
owing in respect of Revolving Loans, which payment shall be due and payable not
later than the Revolving Maturity Date:

         (c) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.08(h), the Additional
Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class shall be automatically and
permanently reduced on the scheduled dates, and in the scheduled amounts, if
any, set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

         (d) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 and not less than $10,000,000, (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate
or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Revolving Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the sum of
the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving Commitments and (iii)
the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Additional Incremental Revolving
Commitments of any Class if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of
Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of such Class in accordance with Section
2.11, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Additional Incremental
Revolving Loans of such Class would exceed the total Additional Incremental
Revolving Commitments of such Class.

         (e) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election
to terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section 2.08(d) at least three
Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction,
specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following
receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the
contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section
shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the Revolving
Commitments or the Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class
delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any
termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent.
Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be made ratably among the
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments of such Class.

         (f) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds in excess
of $5,000,000 are received by or on behalf of Holdings or any Subsidiary in
respect of any Prepayment Event, there shall be a pro rata reduction of
Revolving Commitments, Term Borrowings, Incremental Tranche A Borrowings and, if
provided for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement,
Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments and Additional Incremental Term
Borrowings as provided in this Section 2.08(f) and in Section 2.11(b). In such
event, the Revolving Commitments and, if

provided for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement,
Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments shall, on the third Business Day
after such Net Proceeds are received, be automatically and permanently reduced
in an aggregate amount equal to the product of 100% (or, in the case of any
Prepayment Event referred to in clause (c) of the definition of Prepayment
Event, if, on the date on which any reduction would otherwise be made in respect
of such Prepayment Event either (i) the Facilities shall be rated not lower than
BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or (ii) the Total Leverage Ratio as of such date
is less than 3.5 to 1.0, 50%) of such Net Proceeds and the Reduction Portion in
respect of such Prepayment Event; provided that, in the case of any event
described in clause (a) or (c) of the definition of Prepayment Event, if the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial
Officer to the effect that the Borrower intends to apply the Net Proceeds from
such event (or a portion thereof specified in such certificate) to invest in the
Telecommunications Business of the Borrower and the other Restricted
Subsidiaries within 360 days of the receipt thereof and certifying that no
Default has occurred and is continuing, then no reduction shall be required
pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in respect of such
event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such certificate, if
applicable) except to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have
not been so applied by the end of such period, at which time a reduction shall
be required in accordance with this paragraph (f).

         (g) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, commencing
with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2002, the Revolving Commitments and, if
provided for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement,
Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments shall be automatically and
permanently reduced in an aggregate amount equal to the product of 50% of Excess
Cash Flow for such fiscal year and the Reduction Portion in respect of such
Excess Cash Flow; provided that if, on the date on which any reduction would
otherwise be made pursuant to this Section 2.08(g), either (i) the Facilities
shall be rated not lower than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or (ii) the Total
Leverage Ratio as of such date is less than 3.5 to 1.0, no such reduction shall
be required pursuant to this Section 2.08(g). Each reduction pursuant to this
paragraph shall be made on the date on which financial statements are delivered
pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash
Flow is being calculated (and in any event within 90 days after the end of such
fiscal year).

         (h) Any reduction of the Revolving Commitments, other than a reduction
pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(b) above, shall be applied to reduce the
subsequent scheduled reductions of Revolving Commitments to be made pursuant to
Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(b) above in reverse chronological order. Any reduction
of the Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments of any Class, other than a
reduction pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(c) above, shall be applied to
reduce the subsequent scheduled reductions of Additional Incremental Revolving
Commitments of such Class to be made pursuant to Section 2.08(a) or 2.08(c) as
set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement.

         SECTION 2.9. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each
Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date, (ii) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in Section 2.10,
(iii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Incremental
Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Incremental Tranche A Term Loan
of such Incremental Lender as set forth in Section 2.10, (iv) to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each applicable Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Additional Incremental Loan of any Class of such Lender
as set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement and (v)
to each Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan
made by it on the earlier of the Revolving Maturity Date and the first date
after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a calendar
month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made.

         (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

         (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

         (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to Section
2.09(b) and 2.09(c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (e) No promissory notes evidencing Loans hereunder will be issued
unless a Lender requests that a promissory note be issued to it to evidence its
Loans of any Class. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

         SECTION 2.10. Amortization of Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans.
(a) Subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.10(e), the Borrower shall repay

shall be applied to reduce the subsequent scheduled repayments of Term
Borrowings or Incremental Term Borrowings, respectively to be made pursuant to
this Section in reverse chronological order. Any prepayment of an Additional
Incremental Term Borrowing of any Class shall be applied to reduce the

prepayments shall be made without premium or penalty other than, to the extent

         (b) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds in excess

respect of any Prepayment Event, there shall be a pro rata reduction of
Revolving Commitments, Term Borrowings, Incremental Tranche A Borrowings, and if
provided for in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility Agreement,
Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments and Additional Incremental Term

invest in the Telecommunications Business of the Borrower and the other
Restricted Subsidiaries within 360 days of the receipt thereof and certifying
that no Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be
required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in respect of
such event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such certificate,
if applicable) except to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have
not been so applied by the end of such period, at which time a prepayment shall
be required in accordance with this paragraph (b).

         (c) Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower, commencing

Term Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to the product of (i) 50% of Excess
Cash Flow for such fiscal year and (ii) the Prepayment Portion in respect of
such Excess Cash Flow (such product, the "Excess Cash Flow Prepayment Amount");
provided that if, on the date on which any prepayment would otherwise be made
pursuant to this Section 2.11(c), either (i) the Facilities shall be rated not
lower than BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's or (ii) the Total Leverage Ratio as

         (d) If, on any date, the aggregate Revolving Exposures of all Lenders
exceeds the aggregate Revolving Commitments of all Lenders, or the aggregate
principal amount of the Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of any Class of
all Lenders exceeds the aggregate Additional Incremental Revolving Commitments
of such Class of all Lenders, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving
Loans or Additional Incremental Revolving Loans of such Class, as the case may
be (and, to the extent that any such excess remains after all Revolving Loans
have been prepaid, deposit cash collateral with the Administrative Agent to
secure outstanding LC Exposure), in an amount equal to such excess.

         (e) Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
Section 2.11(f); provided that each prepayment of Borrowings of any Class shall
be applied to prepay ABR Borrowings of such Class before any other Borrowings of
such Class.

         (f) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the applicable Swingline Lender) by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of
prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time,
on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion
thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a
notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice
of termination of the Revolving Commitments or any Additional Incremental
Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of
prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.08. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a
notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative Agent shall
advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as
necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment. Each
prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the
prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the
extent required by Section 2.13.

         SECTION 2.12. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent (i) in the case of Revolving Commitments and Term
Commitments for the account of each Lender fees for each day during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such
Commitment terminates at a rate equal to the applicable Commitment Fee Rate for
such day, (ii) in the case of Incremental Tranche A Commitments for the account
of each Incremental Tranche A Lender fees for each


                                       46
<PAGE>


day during the period from and including the Amendment No. 5 Effective Date but
excluding the Incremental Tranche A Commitment Termination Date at a rate equal
to the applicable Commitment Fee Rate for such day and (iii) in the case of any
Additional Incremental Facility Commitment, the rate set forth in the applicable
Additional Incremental Facility Agreement for such day, in each case on the
unused amount of each Commitment of such Lender on such day (collectively, the
"COMMITMENT FEES"). Accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable in arrears on the
last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on
which the applicable Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to
occur after the date hereof. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis
of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day). For purposes of computing
commitment fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of
a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving
Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender
shall be disregarded for such purpose).

         (b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit for each day during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which
such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any LC Exposure, which fee shall accrue at a rate equal to the
Applicable Margin on Eurodollar Revolving Loans for such day on the amount of
such Lender's LC Exposure on such day (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) and (ii) to the applicable
Issuing Bank a fronting fee in respect of Letters of Credit issued by such
Issuing Bank for each day during the period from and including the Effective
Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving
Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure in respect
of Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, which shall accrue at the rate
or rates per annum separately agreed upon between the Borrower and such Issuing
Bank on the amount of the LC Exposure on such day (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) in respect of Letters of Credit
issued by such Issuing Bank, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
accrued through and including the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
last day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other fees
payable to an Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10
days after demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of
days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

         (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own
account, fees in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

         (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable
Issuing Bank, in the


                                       47

case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of Commitment Fees and
participation fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be
refundable under any circumstances.

         SECTION 2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus (i) in the case of any ABR
Borrowing under the Revolving Facility, the Term Facility or the Incremental
Facility (including each Swingline Loan), the ABR Spread and, if applicable to
any loan (other than an Incremental Term Loan), the Leverage Premium (each as
set forth in "Applicable Margin") and (ii) in the case of any ABR Borrowing
under any Additional Incremental Facility, the Applicable Margin for ABR
Borrowings set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental Facility
Agreement.

         (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest
at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus (i) in the case of any Eurodollar Borrowing under the Revolving Facility,
the Term Facility or the Incremental Facility, the Eurodollar Spread and, if
applicable to any loan (other than an Incremental Term Loan), the Leverage
Premium (each as set forth in "Applicable Margin") and (ii) in the case of any
Eurodollar Borrowing under any Additional Incremental Facility, the Applicable
Margin for Eurodollar Borrowings set forth in the applicable Additional
Incremental Facility Agreement.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any ABR Loan under
the Revolving Facility, the Term Facility or the Incremental Facility, 2% plus
the highest Applicable Margin for ABR Loans plus the ABR, (ii) in the case of
overdue principal of any Eurodollar Loan under the Revolving Facility, the Term
Facility or the Incremental Facility, the higher of (x) 2% plus the highest
Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans plus the Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable to
such Eurodollar Loan on the day before payment was due and (y) the sum of 2%
plus the highest Applicable Margin for ABR Loans plus the ABR, (iii) in the case
of overdue principal of or overdue interest on any Additional Incremental Loan
of any Class, the rate set forth in the applicable Additional Incremental
Facility Agreement and (iv) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Revolving Loans as provided in Section 2.13(a).

         (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans, upon
termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued
pursuant to Section 2.13(c) shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any
repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving
Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on
the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.


                                       48

         (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate
at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in
each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         SECTION 2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

         (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not
exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

         (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that
the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining their
Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

         SECTION 2.15. Increased Costs.

         (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
         the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
         reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate), Swingline
         Lender or Issuing Bank; or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or
         the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
         Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of
         Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost (other than
Taxes) to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to
such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether
of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.


                                       49
<PAGE>


         (b) If any Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing
Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing
Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans
made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender or
Swingline Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a
level below that which such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or such
Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's,
Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's,
Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank or such
Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such
reduction suffered.

         (c) A certificate of a Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, Swingline
Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in Section 2.15(a) or 2.15(b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or such
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender, Swingline Lender or
Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's right
to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section
for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 120 days prior to the
date that such Lender, Swingline Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender's, Swingline Lender's or Issuing Bank's
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the 120-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

         SECTION 2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered
pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section
2.11(f) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any
Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then,
in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost
and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of
interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such
event not occurred, at the rate that would have been applicable to such Loan,
for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current
Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such
Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal
amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it
to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable
amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of
any Lender


                                       50
<PAGE>


setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

         SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable law.

         (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

         (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and Issuing Bank, within 15 days after the date of receipt of a written demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the
Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or Issuing Bank, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or Issuing Bank,
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

         (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

         (e) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), on or prior to the first payment by the
Borrower under this Agreement to such Foreign Lender or Participant and from
time to time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed
and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested
by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or
at a reduced rate.


                                       51
<PAGE>


         (f) If any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has
received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund
to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to
the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Lender without interest (other than any interest paid by the
relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided, however,
that the Borrower, upon request of such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid
over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Lender in the event such Lender is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Nothing contained
in this Section 2.17(f) shall require any Lender to make available its tax
returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems
confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

         (g) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied to the contrary in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including any schedule or exhibit to
any of the foregoing), this Section 2.17 (and Section 10.04 insofar as it
relates to this Section 2.17) shall constitute the complete and exclusive
understanding of the parties in respect of all matters relating to any Taxes
(including interest thereon, additions thereto and penalties in connection
therewith).

         SECTION 2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees
or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15,
2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the date
when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any
amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding
Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at Dallas, Texas,
except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be
made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other
Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following
receipt thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day (unless, in the case of payments in respect of
Eurodollar Loans, such next succeeding Business Day would fall in the next
calendar month, in which case such payment shall be due on the next preceding
Business Day), and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest
thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under
each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

         (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC
Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied
(i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably
among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest
and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal
and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties
entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC
Disbursements then due to such parties.


                                       52
<PAGE>


         (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans (other than Swingline Loans) or participations in
LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment
of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans (other than
Swingline Loans) and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and
accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then
the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face
value) participations in the Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the
extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans (other than Swingline Loans) and
participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement (including without limitation pursuant to Section 2.11)
or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or
sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC
Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph
shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

         (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or an Issuing Bank hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable
Issuing Bank or Banks, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or Issuing
Banks, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation.

         (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by
it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or 2.05(e), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or
10.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision


                                       53
<PAGE>


hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such
Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

         SECTION 2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

         (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and,
if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline
Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender
shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of
its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, (i) as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply or (ii) such Lender elects to withdraw its request.

         SECTION 2.20. Additional Incremental Facilities and Commitments. (a) At
any time prior to December 31, 2002, and so long as no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, the
Borrower may request, on one or more occasions, by notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Incremental Facility Arrangers, that one or more Lenders (and/or
one or more other Persons which shall become Lenders as provided in Section
2.20(d) below) provide one or more additional facilities (each, an "Additional
Incremental Facility"), each of which shall provide for commitments (the
"Additional Incremental Commitments") in an aggregate amount of not less than
$100,000,000 and all of which Additional Incremental Facilities shall provide
for Additional Incremental Commitments in an aggregate amount not in excess of
$500,000,000; provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to provide any
Additional Incremental Commitment and any Lender (or any other Person


                                       54
<PAGE>


which becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(d) below) may provide Additional
Incremental Commitments without the consent of any other Lender.

         (b) The maturity date, scheduled amortization and commitment
reductions, mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions, interest rate,
minimum borrowings and prepayments, commitment fees and other amounts payable in
respect of any Additional Incremental Facility, and certain agent
determinations, shall be as set forth in an agreement (an "Additional
Incremental Facility Agreement") among the Loan Parties, the Administrative
Agent, each Incremental Facility Arranger (but only if it is acting in the
capacity of joint lead arranger with respect to such Additional Incremental
Facility) and the Lenders and other Persons agreeing to provide Additional
Incremental Commitments thereunder; provided that any term Incremental Loans
(the "Additional Incremental Term Loans") shall have a Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of no less than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Term Loans
then outstanding and any revolving Incremental Commitment (the "Additional
Incremental Revolving Commitments" and any loans made pursuant thereto, the
"Additional Incremental Revolving Loans") shall have a Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of not less than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Revolving
Commitments then outstanding.

         (c) [Intentionally deleted]

         (d) The effectiveness of any Additional Incremental Facility to be
created under this Section 2.20, and the obligation of any Lender or other
Person providing any Additional Incremental Commitment thereunder to make any
Additional Incremental Loans pursuant thereto, is subject to, in addition to the
conditions set forth in Article 4, the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions: each Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, each Incremental Facility
Arranger (but only if it is acting in the capacity of joint lead arranger with
respect to such Additional Incremental Facility) and each Lender or other Person
providing Additional Incremental Commitments thereunder (each, an "Additional
Incremental Lender") shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative
Agent an Additional Incremental Facility Agreement with respect to such
Additional Incremental Facility, (x) the Administrative Agent shall have
received, and (y) the Administrative Agent shall have received for the
respective accounts of any other agents and the Additional Incremental Lenders,
all fees and other amounts payable by the Borrower in respect of such Additional
Incremental Facility on or prior to such date of effectiveness and the
Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have received such documents and
certificates, and such legal opinions, as the Administrative Agent and the
Incremental Facility Arrangers or their counsel shall reasonably request,
including documents, certificates and legal opinions relating to the
organization, existence and good standing of each Loan Party, the authorization
of such Additional Incremental Facility and other legal matters relating to the
Loan Parties or the Loan Documents (including the applicable Additional
Incremental Facility Agreement). The Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender as to the effectiveness of each Additional Incremental Facility
hereunder.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each of Holdings and the Borrower represents and warrants to the
Lenders that:

         SECTION 3.1. Organization; Powers. Each of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

         SECTION 3.2. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's corporate powers
and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required,
stockholder action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each
of Holdings and the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to
which any Loan Party is to be a party, when executed and delivered by such Loan
Party, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of Holdings, the
Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law.

         SECTION 3.3. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions (a)
do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or any
other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained
or made and are in full force and effect and except filings necessary to perfect
Liens created under the Loan Documents (if any), (b) will not violate any
applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational
documents of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary or any order of any
Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default under any
indenture, agreement or other instrument binding upon Holdings or any Restricted
Subsidiary or any of their respective assets, or give rise to a right thereunder
to require any payment to be made by Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, and
(d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, except Liens created under the Loan
Documents (if any).

         SECTION 3.4. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a)
Holdings has heretofore furnished to the Lenders Holdings' consolidated balance
sheet and statements of operations, stockholders equity and cash flows as of and
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998, December 31, 1999 and December 31,
2000, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent public accountants. Such
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position and results of operations and cash flows of Holdings and the
Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP.

         (b) Holdings has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its pro forma
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2000 and projected pro forma
statements of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2001, prepared giving effect to (x) the Transactions under the Incremental
Facility and the Structured Note Financing and (y) the transactions described in
clause (x) and, in addition, the sale of its Williams Communications Solutions
business unit, as if such events had occurred on such date or on the first day
of such fiscal year, as the case may be. Such projected pro forma consolidated
balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows (i) have been
prepared in good faith based on the same assumptions used to prepare the pro
forma financial statements included in the Information Memorandum (which
assumptions are believed by Holdings and the Borrower to be reasonable), (ii)
are based on the best information available to Holdings and the Borrower after
due inquiry, (iii) accurately reflect all adjustments necessary to give effect
to the Transactions under the Incremental Facility and the Structured Note
Financing and, in the case of one such set of financial statements, the sale of
its Williams Communications Solutions business unit, and (iv) present fairly, in
all material respects, the pro forma financial position of Holdings and


                                       56
<PAGE>


the Subsidiaries as of such date and for such periods as if the Transactions,
the Structured Note Financing and, in the case of one such set of financial
statements, the sale of its Williams Communications Solutions business unit had
occurred on such date or at the beginning of such period, as the case may be.

         (c) Except as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above
or the notes thereto or in the Information Memorandum and except for the
Disclosed Matters, after giving effect to the Transactions, none of Holdings or
any Restricted Subsidiary has, as of the Effective Date, any material contingent
liabilities, unusual material long-term commitments or unrealized material
losses.

         (d) The projections delivered to the Lenders on the Amendment No. 5
Effective Date (the "Projections") were based on assumptions believed by the
Borrower and Holdings in good faith to be reasonable when made and as of their
date represented the Borrower's and Holdings' good faith estimate of future
performance of Holdings and the Subsidiaries and of the Borrower and its
consolidated subsidiaries.

         (e) Since December 31, 2000, there has been no Material Adverse Change.

         SECTION 3.5. Properties. (a) Each of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real
and personal property material to its business (including its Mortgaged
Properties, if any), except for minor defects in title that do not interfere
with its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize
such properties for their intended purposes. None of the properties and assets
of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is subject to any Lien other than
Permitted Encumbrances, Liens created by the Collateral Documents (if any) and
other Liens permitted under Section 6.02.

         (b) Each of Holdings and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use,
all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property
material to its business, and the use thereof by Holdings and the Subsidiaries
does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such
infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property that is
owned or leased by Holdings, the Borrower or any other Loan Party (other than
the Parent) as of the Effective Date after giving effect to the Transactions.

         SECTION 3.6. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower,
threatened against or affecting Holdings or any Subsidiary (i) as to which there
is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely
determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed Matters) or (ii)
that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

         (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to any
other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither Holdings nor any
Subsidiary (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain,
maintain or comply with any permit, license or


                                       57
<PAGE>


other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to
any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received written notice of any claim with
respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any
violations of any Environmental Law or any release, threatened release or
exposure to any Hazardous Materials that is likely to form the basis of any
Environmental Liability.

         (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the
status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 3.7. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of Holdings and
the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders of any
Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures,
agreements and other instruments binding upon it or its property, except where
the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is
continuing.

         SECTION 3.8. Investment and Holding Company Status. Neither Holdings
nor any Restricted Subsidiary is (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a
"holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

         SECTION 3.9. Taxes. Each of Holdings and the Subsidiaries has timely
filed or caused to be filed (or the Parent has filed or caused to be filed) all
Tax returns and reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be
paid (or the Parent has paid or caused to be paid) all Taxes required to have
been paid by or with respect to it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which Holdings or such Subsidiary,
as applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date
of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $25,000,000 the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the
present value of all accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans
(based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial
statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $25,000,000 the fair
market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

         SECTION 3.11. Disclosure. Holdings and the Borrower have disclosed to
the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to
which Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is subject, and all other matters
known to any of them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Information
Memorandum nor any of the other reports, financial statements, certificates or
other information furnished by or on behalf of any Loan Party to any Agent or
any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented
by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided that, with respect to projected financial information, Holdings and the
Borrower represent only that such information was prepared in good faith based
upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.



                                       58
<PAGE>


         SECTION 3.12. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of, and
the direct or indirect ownership interest of Holdings or the Borrower in, each
Subsidiary and identifies each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in
each case as of the Effective Date.

         SECTION 3.13. Insurance. Schedule 3.13 sets forth a description of all
insurance maintained by or on behalf of Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, all premiums in respect of
such insurance have been paid.

         SECTION 3.14. Labor Matters. As of the Effective Date, there are no
strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary
pending or, to the knowledge of Holdings or the Borrower, threatened. The hours
worked by and payments made to employees of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any
other applicable Federal, state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters.
All payments due from Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, or for which any
claim may be made against Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary, on account of
wages and employee health and welfare insurance and other benefits, have been
paid or accrued as a liability on the books of Holdings or such Restricted
Subsidiary. The consummation of the Transactions and the Reorganization has not
and will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on
the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement by which
Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound.

         SECTION 3.15. Solvency. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Effective Date and immediately following the making
of each Loan made on the Effective Date and after giving effect to the
application of the proceeds of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of
each Loan Party will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent
or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of each Loan
Party will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liability of its debts and other liabilities, subordinated, contingent or
otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c)
each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become absolute and
matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have unreasonably small capital with
which to conduct the business in which it is engaged as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Effective Date.

         SECTION 3.16. No Burdensome Restrictions. No contract, lease, agreement
or other instrument to which Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or
by which any of their property is bound or affected, no charge, corporate
restriction, judgment, decree or order and no provision of applicable law or
governmental regulation could reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 3.17. Representations in Loan Documents True and Correct. As of
the dates when made and as of the Effective Date, each representation and
warranty of Holdings or any Restricted Subsidiary party thereto contained in any
Loan Document is true and correct.

prior to the consummation of the Spin-Off, in the event that Holdings and the
Restricted Subsidiaries fail to comply with any of Sections 6.15 through 6.19,
inclusive, for any period or on any date set forth therein, the Parent shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to make, within three Business Days of
the date upon which financial statements as of the last day of such period are
delivered or required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or (b), a cash
equity contribution to Holdings in exchange for Qualifying Equity Interests of
Holdings (which Holdings shall thereupon contribute to the Borrower, in exchange
for Qualifying Equity Interests of the Borrower) to cure such failure.

          (b) If such contribution is made to cure a failure to comply with the
covenant contained in Section 6.16, such contribution shall be in an amount
sufficient, when added to EBITDA for the applicable period, to enable Holdings
and the Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with such covenant on a consolidated
basis. Upon the making of any such capital contribution to Holdings and to the
Borrower in the amount specified above, the amount so contributed (to the
extent, but only to the extent, of the shortfall in EBITDA for the applicable
period) shall thereafter be deemed to have been EBITDA in the last fiscal
quarter of such period for purposes of all calculations in respect of compliance
with Section 6.16 thereafter.

          (c) If such contribution is made to cure a failure to comply with a
covenant contained in Section 6.15, 6.17, 6.18 or 6.19, such contribution shall
be in an amount sufficient, when applied to repay or prepay Indebtedness of
Holdings and the Restricted Subsidiaries, to enable Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such contribution and
application, to comply with such covenant on a consolidated basis.

          (d) The right to cure provided in this Section 6.20 may not be
exercised in respect of more than two consecutive quarters or more than three
times in the aggregate during the term of the Facilities.

rights and powers in their capacities as Lenders, Swingline Lenders or Issuing

Banks and may exercise the same as though they were not Agents, and each such
institution and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with Holdings or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent hereunder.

         (c) The Agents shall not have any duties or obligations except those

such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (iii) except as expressly set
forth in the Loan Documents, the Agents shall not have any duty to disclose, and
shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to
Holdings or any Subsidiary that is communicated to or obtained by any
institution serving as an Agent or any of its affiliates in any capacity.

         (d) No Agent shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.

         (e) No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to such Agent by Holdings, the
Borrower or a Lender, and no Agent shall be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,

delivered to the Administrative Agent.

         SECTION 8.2. Reliance by Agents. Each Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. Each
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

         SECTION 8.3. Delegation to Sub-Agents. Each Agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise any of its rights and powers by or through any
one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. The Agents and any such
sub-agents may perform any and all of their duties and exercise rights and
powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of
the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their
respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.

         SECTION 8.4. Resignation of Agents. Subject to the appointment and
acceptance of a successor Agent as provided in this paragraph, any Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the
Issuing Banks,


                                       86
<PAGE>

appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank organized under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof, having (x) an office in any State of the
United States and (y) capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating at
least $200,000,000, or an affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After the Agent's resignation
hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent.

         SECTION 8.5. Non-reliance on Agents or other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent, any Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         SECTION 8.6. Syndication Agent, Incremental Facility Arrangers and
Co-Documentation Agents. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Loan
Document to the contrary, the Syndication Agent, the Incremental Facility
Arrangers and the Co-Documentation Agents shall have no obligation or
responsibility as such hereunder other than, in the case of the Syndication
Agent or the Incremental Facility Arrangers, as expressly set forth herein.


                                    ARTICLE 9

                               HOLDINGS GUARANTEE

         SECTION 9.1. The Guarantee. Holdings unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees the full and punctual payment of all present and future indebtedness
and other obligations of the Borrower evidenced by or arising under any Loan
Document and all present and future indebtedness and other obligations of the
Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary under any Hedging Agreement
permitted under Section 6.01 (a "Specified Hedging Agreement") as and when the
same shall become due and payable, whether at maturity or by declaration or
otherwise, according to the terms hereof and thereof (including, without
limitation, any Post-Petition Interest). If the Borrower or any other Restricted
Subsidiary fails punctually to pay any indebtedness or other obligation
guaranteed hereby which is due and payable, Holdings unconditionally agrees to
cause such payment to be made punctually as and when the same shall become due
and payable, whether at maturity or by declaration or otherwise, and as if such
payment were made by the Borrower or such other Restricted Subsidiary.

         SECTION 9.2. Guarantee Unconditional. The obligations of Holdings under
this Article 9 shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:

                  (a) any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or
         release in respect of any obligation of the Borrower or any other Loan
         Party under any Loan Document or Specified Hedging Agreement, by
         operation of law or otherwise;


                                       87
<PAGE>

                  (b) any modification, amendment or waiver of or supplement to
         any Loan Document or Specified Hedging Agreement;

                  (c) any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of
         any direct or indirect security, or of any guarantee or other liability
         of any third party, for any obligation of the Borrower or any Loan
         Party under any Loan Document or Specified Hedging Agreement;

                  (d) any change in the corporate existence, structure or
         ownership of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any insolvency,
         bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the
         Borrower or any other Loan Party or its assets, or any resulting
         release or discharge of any obligation of the Borrower or any other
         Loan Party contained in any Loan Document or Specified Hedging
         Agreement;

                  (e) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which
         Holdings may have at any time against the Borrower or any other Loan
         Party, any Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Lender or any other Person,
         whether or not arising in connection herewith or any unrelated
         transaction; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion
         of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

                  (f) any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against
         the Borrower or any other Loan Party for any reason of any Loan
         Document or Specified Hedging Agreement, or any provision of applicable
         law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by any other Loan
         Party of any amount payable by it under any Loan Document or Specified
         Hedging Agreement; or

                  (g) any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by
         any other Loan Party, any Lender or any other Person or any other
         circumstance that might, but for the provisions of this Section,
         constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Holdings' obligations
         under this Article 9.

         SECTION 9.3. Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in
Certain Circumstances. Holdings' obligations under this Article 9 constitute a
continuing guaranty and shall remain in full force and effect until the
Commitments shall have been terminated, all Letters of Credit shall have expired
or been terminated, all Specified Hedging Agreements shall have been terminated
and all amounts payable under the Loan Documents and the Specified Hedging
Agreements shall have been indefeasibly paid in full. If at any time any amount
payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document or by the Borrower or any other
Restricted Subsidiary under any Specified Hedging Agreement is rescinded or must
be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any Loan Party or otherwise, Holdings' obligations under this
Article 9 with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as
though such payment had become due but had not been made at such time.

         SECTION 9.4. Waiver. Holdings irrevocably waives acceptance hereof,
presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as
any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person against the
Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary or any other Person.


                                       88
<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.5. Subrogation. When Holdings makes any payment under this
Article 9 with respect to the obligations of the Borrower or any other
Restricted Subsidiary, Holdings shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee
against the Borrower or such other Restricted Subsidiary with respect to the
portion of such obligations paid by Holdings; provided that Holdings shall not
enforce any payment by way of subrogation or contribution against the Borrower
or any Subsidiary so long as any amount payable under any Loan Document or
Specified Hedging Agreement remains unpaid.

         SECTION 9.6. Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for
payment of any amount payable by any Loan Party under any Loan Document or
Specified Hedging Agreement is stayed upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of such Loan Party, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of such Loan Document or Specified Hedging
Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by Holdings under this Article 9
forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent made, in the case of any Loans,
at the request of the requisite number of Lenders specified in Section 7.01
hereof or, in the case of obligations under a Specified Hedging Agreement, at
the request of the relevant Lender or Lenders or affiliate or affiliates of such
Lender or Lenders.

         SECTION 9.7. Successors and Assigns. This guarantee is for the benefit
of the Lenders, the Hedge Counterparties and their respective successors and
assigns. If any Loans, participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans or
other amounts payable under the Loan Documents are assigned pursuant to Section
10.04 of the Credit Agreement, or any rights under any Specified Hedging
Agreement are assigned pursuant thereto, the rights under this Article 9, to the
extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned, shall be transferred with
such indebtedness.


                                   ARTICLE 10

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 10.1. Notices. Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and
other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be
delivered by hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or
registered mail or sent by telecopy, as follows:

         (a) if to Holdings or the Borrower, to it at Williams Communications
Group, Inc., One Williams Center, Suite 2600, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172, Attention
of (other than administrative notices) Scott E. Schubert (Telecopy No.
918-573-6024) or (for administrative notices) Attention of Kerri Lyle (Telecopy

         (b) if to the Administrative Agent, to it at Bank of America, N.A., 901
Main Street, Dallas, Texas 75202, Attention of (other than Borrowing Requests)
Pamela Kurtzman, 64th Floor (Telecopy No. (214) 209-9390) or (for Borrowing
Requests) Judy Schneidmiller, 14th Floor (Telecopy No. 214-209-2118);

         (c) if to Bank of America, as Issuing Bank, to it at 901 Main Street,
64th Floor, Main Street, Dallas, Texas 75202, Attention of Pamela Kurtzman
(Telecopy No. 214-209-9390);

         (d) if to Chase, as Issuing Bank, to it at 270 Park Avenue, 37th Floor,

                                       89
<PAGE>

         (e) if to Bank of America, as Swingline Lender, to it at 901 Main
Street, 64th Floor, Main Street, Dallas, Texas 75202, Attention of Pamela
Kurtzman (Telecopy No. 214-209-9390);

         (f) if to Chase, as Swingline Lender, to it at One Chase Manhattan
Plaza, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10081, Attention of Winslowe Ogbourne
(Telecopy No. 212-552-5700); and

         (g) if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy number)
set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire.

         Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices
and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All
notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date
of receipt.

         SECTION 10.2. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
Section 10.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether
the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

         (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case
of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that
are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender
without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce
any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or
postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written
consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or 2.18(c)
in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby,
without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of
this Section or the definition of "Required Lenders" or


                                       90
<PAGE>

any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any rights
thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without
the written consent of each Lender (or each Lender of such Class, as the case
may be), (vi) release Holdings or substantially all of the Subsidiary Loan
Parties from their respective Guarantees hereunder under the Subsidiary
Guarantee (except as expressly provided herein or therein), or limit its
liability in respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each
Lender, (vii) change any condition set forth in Section 4.03 without the written
consent of each Incremental Lender, or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan
Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect
of payments due to, or requirements to make loans by, Lenders holding Loans of
any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the
written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding
Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided further that (A)
no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties
of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the affected Issuing Bank
or the affected Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) any waiver,
amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms affects the rights
or duties under this Agreement of the Lenders with Commitments or Loans of any
Class or Classes (but not Lenders with Commitments or Loans of any other Class
or Classes) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by Holdings, the Borrower and the requisite percentage in interest of the
Lenders with Commitments or Loans of the affected Class or Classes.

         SECTION 10.3. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent and the Incremental Facility
Arrangers and their respective affiliates, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent and the Incremental Facility Arrangers in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers
of the provisions thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal
or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and
(iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers, any Issuing Bank, any
Swingline Lender or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of
any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers and
the Syndication Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection
with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such
out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or
negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

         (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers, the Issuing Banks, the
Swingline Lenders and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the
foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and
hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements
of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery


                                       91
<PAGE>

of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby,
the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use
of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by any Issuing Bank to honor a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in
connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter
of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property owned or operated by Holdings or any
Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to Holdings or any
Subsidiary, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

         (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers,
any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender under Sections 10.03(a) or 10.03(b),
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication
Agent, the Incremental Facility Arrangers, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline
Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of
such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent, the
Incremental Facility Arrangers, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender in its
capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be
determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures,
outstanding Loans (other than Revolving Loans) and unused Commitments (other
than Revolving Commitments) at the time.

         (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Holdings and the
Borrower will not and will not permit any other Restricted Subsidiary to assert,
and each hereby waives for itself and on behalf of its subsidiaries, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or
Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

         (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after
written demand therefor.

         SECTION 10.4. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any
affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that the


                                       92
<PAGE>

Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender, each Issuing Bank
and each Swingline Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the
Borrower without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any affiliate of any Issuing Bank that issues any
Letter of Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline
Lenders and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or
by reason of this Agreement.

         (b) (1) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitments and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i)
each of the Borrower (except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
affiliate of a Lender) and Administrative Agent (except in the case of an
assignment to an affiliate of a Lender) (and, in the case of an assignment of
all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or any Lender's obligations in
respect of its LC Exposure or Swingline Exposure, the Issuing Banks and the
Swingline Lenders) must give its prior written consent to such assignment (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), (ii) except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitments or Loans, after
giving effect to such assignment, the amount of the Commitments or Loans of each
Class held by each of the assignor Lender and its affiliates and the assignee
Lender and its affiliates (determined in each case as of the date the Assignment
and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000 unless each of the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, (iii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that this
Section 10.04(b)(iii) shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in
respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans, (iv) the parties to each
assignment (excluding any assignment by a Lender to an affiliate of such Lender)
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, (v) the
parties to each assignment by a Lender to an affiliate of such Lender shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $1,500, (vi) the assignee, if
it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Administrative Questionnaire and (vii) the Incremental Facility Arrangers shall
be notified by the Administrative Agent of any assignment of the Incremental
Facility; and provided further that any consent of the Borrower otherwise
required under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant
to Section 10.04(d), from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this


                                       93
<PAGE>
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to
be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03). Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with Section 10.04(e). Each Lender that is an
investment fund hereby agrees to notify the Administrative Agent and the
Incremental Facility Arrangers of any change of the identity of the investment
manager for such fund.

         (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an
"SPC") identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower
all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be
obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i)
nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to make any Loan, (ii)
if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all
or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such
Loan pursuant to the terms hereof. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder
shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as
if, such Loan were made by such Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees
that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation
under this Agreement (all liability for which shall remain with the Granting
Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the
date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPC, it will not institute
against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
under the laws of the United States or any State thereof. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 10.04, any
SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Loans to the Granting
Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Borrower and
Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the
account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (ii)
disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This section may not
be amended without the written consent of each SPC that, at the time of such
proposed amendment, has an outstanding Loan or Loans to the Borrower. For
purposes of Section 10.02 of this Agreement and any other provision of any Loan
Document requiring the consent or approval of any Lender, the Granting Lender
shall, notwithstanding the funding of any Loans by any SPC, have the sole right
to consent to or approve any waiver or amendment of any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or to exercise any other right to consent
or to grant approval under any Loan Document.

         (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in any State of the United
States, a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and Holdings, the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.


                                       94

         (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 10.04(b)
and any written consent to such assignment required by Section 10.04(b), the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph.

         (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) Holdings, the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to Section 10.04(f), the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 10.04(b). To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

         (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment
under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as
though it were a Lender.

         (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided


                                       95
<PAGE>

that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender
from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee
for such Lender as a party hereto.

         SECTION 10.5. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing
Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit
is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article 8 shall
survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration
or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         SECTION 10.6. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other
Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable
to the Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank constitute the entire contract
among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the
subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall
become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto,
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.7. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

         SECTION 10.8. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender and
each of their respective affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender, Issuing
Bank, Swingline Lender or affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower or Holdings against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or
Holdings, as the case may be, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
held by such Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender, irrespective of whether
or not such Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender shall have made any demand
under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights
of each Lender, Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
such Lender, Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender may have.

         SECTION 10.9. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.


                                       96
<PAGE>

         (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York
County and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
affect any right that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline
Lender or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against Holdings, the
Borrower or their respective properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

         (c) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in any court referred to in Section 10.09(b). Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

         (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

         SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

         SECTION 10.11. Headings. Article and Section headings used herein and
the Table of Contents are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.12. Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Banks, the Swingline Lenders and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its affiliates' (other than affiliates that are


                                       97
<PAGE>

direct competitors of any material business of Holdings and the Restricted
Subsidiaries) directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement (other than a direct competitor of any material business of Holdings
and the Restricted Subsidiaries), (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to
the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than Holdings or the Borrower. For the
purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from
Holdings or the Borrower relating to Holdings or the Borrower or its business,
other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent,
any Issuing Bank, any Swingline Lender or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
prior to disclosure by Holdings or the Borrower; provided that, in the case of
information received from Holdings or the Borrower after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

         SECTION 10.13. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                                    GUARANTY


TO:      WILLIAMS HEADQUARTERS BUILDING COMPANY ("Lessor")
         One Williams Center, Suite 2200
         Tulsa, Oklahoma  74172

                  Lessor is hereby requested by the undersigned (the
"Guarantor"), to extend credit to Williams Technology Center, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (hereinafter called the "Lessee") in the principal
amount of TWO HUNDRED FORTY-FIVE MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($245,000,000.00)
evidenced by that certain Master Lease of even date herewith, and executed among
Lessee, Lessor and Guarantor (the "Master Lease"), as further described in that
certain Agreement of Purchase and Sale of even date herewith, between Lessee and
Lessor (the "Purchase Agreement").

                  To induce Lessor to extend such credit, in consideration
thereof, and in consideration of the benefits to accrue to the undersigned
therefrom, the undersigned hereby guarantees to Lessor the prompt payment at
maturity, and at all times thereafter, of such indebtedness, including interest
thereon and all costs, reasonable attorney's fees, and expenses which may be
suffered by Lessor by reason of the Lessee's default in the payment of such
indebtedness or the default of the Guarantor hereunder. Guarantor further
guarantees to Lessor the full, punctual and faithful performance of each and
every covenant, term, condition or obligation to be performed by the Lessee in
respect to the Master Lease and/or the terms of any other instrument executed in
connection with or as security for the payment of the indebtedness, including
without limitation, the Purchase Agreement.

                  This is an absolute and continuing guarantee of payment in any
event and shall not terminate until Lessor has been paid in full the total
amount of such indebtedness and the Lessee has performed all obligations as
prescribed in the Master Lease.

                  Guarantor agrees that the liability under this Guaranty shall
not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or affected by:

                  a. The taking or accepting of any other security or guaranty
for any or all of such indebtedness or obligation;

                  b. Any release, surrender, exchange, subordination or loss of
any security at any time existing in connection with any or all of such
indebtedness;

                  c. Any partial release of the liability of the undersigned
hereunder or under any other instrument executed in connection with or as
security for such indebtedness;

                  d. The insolvency, bankruptcy, disability or lack of entity
power of Lessee,


                                      117
<PAGE>

Guarantor, or any party at any time liable for the payment of any or all of such
indebtedness whether now existing or hereafter occurring;

                  e. Any renewal, extension and/or rearrangement of the Master
Lease or the payment of any or all of the indebtedness or the performance of any
covenants contained in any instrument executed in connection with such
indebtedness, either with or without notice to or consent of Guarantor, or any
adjustment, indulgence, forbearance or compromise that may be granted or given
by Lessor to any party;

                  f. Any neglect, delay, omission, failure or refusal of Lessor
to take or prosecute any action for the collection of any of such indebtedness
or to foreclose or take or prosecute any action in connection with the Master
Lease or as security for any of such indebtedness; or

                  g. Any failure of Lessor to notify Guarantor of any renewal,
extension or assignment of the indebtedness guaranteed hereby, or any part
thereof, or the release of any security or of any other action taken or
refrained from being taken by Lessor against Lessee or any new agreement between
Lessor and Lessee, it being understood that Lessor shall not be required to give
Guarantor any notice of any kind under any circumstances whatsoever with respect
to or in connection with the indebtedness hereby guaranteed.

                  In the event of default in payment or performance by Lessee,
Guarantor agrees that after the expiration of any applicable cure period set
forth in the Master Lease, Lessor may first proceed against this Guaranty and
against any security given by Guarantor in connection herewith to satisfy such
indebtedness, without first having (i) to proceed against the Lessee, or (ii) to
proceed against or give credit for any security which may have been given to
Lessor by the Lessee or any other party.

                  Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance hereof and the
presentment, demand, protest and notice of nonpayment or nonperformance, or
protest in connection with the Master Lease, and Guarantor waives all set-offs
and counterclaims. Payment and performance by Guarantor hereunder shall not
entitle Guarantor, by subrogation or otherwise, to any payment by Lessee except
after Lessor has received full payment and performance of all amounts and
obligations to be paid and performed by the Lessee contingently, absolutely or
otherwise, by reason of the instruments described herein.

                  Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes any right of
reimbursement, subrogation, indemnification or other recourse or claim, whether
contingent or matured, which Guarantor may have against Lessee. It is the
express intent of Guarantor to eliminate any debtor/creditor relationship
between Guarantor and Lessee. Guarantor hereby expressly releases and waives any
and all present and future rights as a creditor of Lessee in all respects.
Guarantor further waives and relinquishes all rights, remedies, defenses and
claims and/or rights of counterclaim, recoupment, offset or setoff, including,
but not limited to, all offsets, setoffs, rights, remedies or defenses which may
be afforded Guarantor by any of Title 12, OKLA. STAT. Section 686 and/or Title
15, OKLA. STAT. Sections 334, 337, 338 and 344, as any of such statutes may be
amended from time to time.

                  This Guaranty shall be binding on Guarantor, its successors
and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of Lessor and its successors and
assigns. All of Lessor's rights hereunder shall be cumulative and not
alternative.

                  This instrument is executed and delivered as an incident to a
lending transaction negotiated and consummated in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and shall be
construed according to the laws of the State of Oklahoma.

                  If any provision of this Guaranty shall be held to be void or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be deemed modified so as to
constitute a provision conforming as nearly as possible to such void or
unenforceable provision while still remaining valid and enforceable, and the
remaining terms or provisions hereof shall not be affected thereby.

                  EXECUTED this 11th day of September, 2001.

                            Interest Rate Calculation


The following definitions shall apply to this EXHIBIT I:

         "ABR", when used herein, refers to interest at a rate determined by
reference to the Alternate Base Rate.

         "Applicable Margin" means, for any day, (i) the applicable rate per
annum set forth below under the caption "Eurodollar Spread" or "ABR Spread", as
the case may be, based upon the Guarantor's Bank Facility Rating set by S&P and
Moody's, respectively, applicable on such date plus (ii) the applicable rate per
annum set forth below under the caption "Leverage Premium", unless the Total
Leverage Ratio, as determined by reference to the financial statements delivered
to the Lessor in respect of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of WCG, is
less than 6:00 to 1:00.

         "Eurodollar", when used herein, refers to interest at a rate determined
by reference to the Adjusted LIBO Rate.

         "Facilities" means the Term Facility, the Revolving Facility, the
Incremental Facility and each Additional Incremental Facility, all as defined in
the Credit Agreement.

         "LIBO Rate" means, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate, the rate
appearing on Page 3750 of the Telerate Service (or on any successor or
substitute page of such Service, or any successor to or substitute for such
Service, providing rate quotations comparable to those currently provided on
such page of such Service, as determined by the Lessor from time to time for
purposes of providing quotations of interest rates applicable to dollar deposits
in the London interbank market) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two
(2) Business Days prior to the first day of each calendar month, as the rate for
dollar deposits with a maturity of thirty (30) days. In the event that such rate
is not available at such time for any reason, then the "LIBO Rate" shall be the
rate (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) at which dollar
deposits of $5,000,000 and for a maturity of thirty (30) days are offered by the
principal London office of the CitiBank, N.A., in immediately available funds in
the London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two (2)
Business Days prior to the first day of each calendar month. In either case, the

in effect a rating for the Facilities, then the Applicable Margin shall be based
on such rating, (iii) if the ratings established by S&P and Moody's for the
Facilities shall fall within different Levels, then the Applicable Margin shall
be based on the lower of the two ratings, (iv) if the ratings established by S&P
and Moody's for the Facilities shall fall within the same Level, then the
Applicable Margin shall be based on that Level and (v) if the ratings
established by S&P and Moody's for the Facilities shall be changed (other than
as a result of a change in the rating system of S&P or Moody's), such change
shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the
applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall apply
during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on
