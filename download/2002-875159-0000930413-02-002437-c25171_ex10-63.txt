                                   THE CREDITS

                  SECTION 2.01.  SYNDICATED LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, at the request of any Account Party the Lenders agree at any time and
from time to time during the Availability Period to issue Syndicated Letters of
Credit for the account of such Account Party in an aggregate amount that will
not result in the Credit Exposure exceeding the Commitments (it being understood
that Syndicated Letters of Credit may be issued, or be outstanding, for the
account of more than one of the Account Parties at any time). Each Syndicated
Letter of Credit shall be in such form as is consistent with the requirements of
the applicable regulatory authorities in Illinois, California, Wisconsin or New
York as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise agreed
to by the Administrative Agent and XL Capital; PROVIDED that, without the prior
consent of each Lender, no Syndicated Letter of Credit may be issued that would
vary the several and not joint nature of the obligations of the Lenders
thereunder as provided in the next succeeding sentence. Each Syndicated Letter
of Credit shall be issued by all of the Lenders thereunder, acting through the
Administrative Agent, at the time of issuance as a single multi-bank letter of
credit, but the obligation of each Lender thereunder shall be several and not
joint, based upon its Applicable Percentage of the aggregate undrawn amount of
such Syndicated Letter of Credit.

                  (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. To
request the issuance of a Syndicated Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal
or extension of an outstanding Syndicated Letter of Credit), an Account Party
shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic communication, if
arrangements for doing so have been approved by the


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 15 -


Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the
requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting
the issuance of a Syndicated Letter of Credit, or identifying the Syndicated
Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of
issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as the case may be (which shall be a
Business Day), the date on which such Syndicated Letter of Credit is to expire
(which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the amount of such
Syndicated Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and
the terms and conditions of (and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend, as the case may be) such Syndicated Letter of
Credit. If any Syndicated Letter of Credit shall provide for the automatic
extension of the expiry date thereof unless the Administrative Agent gives
notice that such expiry date shall not be extended, then the Administrative
Agent will give such notice if requested to do so by the Required Lenders in a
notice given to the Administrative Agent not more than 60 days, but not less
than 45 days, prior to the current expiry date of such Syndicated Letter of
Credit. If requested by the Administrative Agent, such Account Party also shall
submit a letter of credit application on JPMCB's standard form in connection
with any request for a Syndicated Letter of Credit. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms
and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement
submitted by any Account Party to, or entered into by any Account Party with,
the Administrative Agent relating to any Syndicated Letter of Credit, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                  (c) LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNTS. A Syndicated Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Syndicated Letter of Credit the Account
Parties shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to
such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (A) the aggregate Credit
Exposure of the Lenders shall not exceed the excess, if any, of (i) the
aggregate amount of the Commitments OVER (ii) the aggregate stated amount of all
letters of credit identified in Schedule VI (other than Backstopped Letters of
Credit and Replaced Letters of Credit) at the time outstanding and (B) the sum
of (i) the Credit Exposure (excluding any Alternative Currency LC Exposure) of
each Lender PLUS (ii) the aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit
identified in Schedule VI issued by such Lender (other than Backstopped Letters
of Credit and Replaced Letters of Credit) at the time outstanding shall not
exceed the Commitment of such Lender.

                  (d) EXPIRY DATE. Each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expire
at or prior to the close of business on the date one year after the date of the
issuance of such Syndicated Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension).

                  (e) OBLIGATION OF LENDERS. The obligation of any Lender under
any Syndicated Letter of Credit shall be several and not joint and shall at any
time be in an amount equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the
aggregate undrawn amount of such Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each
Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide.

                  (f) CONTINUATION OF EXISTING LETTERS OF CREDIT. Subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, each Letter of Credit under (and as defined in) the
Existing Letter of Credit Agreement which is outstanding on the Effective Date
and designated by the Account Parties in

                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 16 -


a notice to the Administrative Agent shall be continued hereunder on the
Effective Date by all of the Lenders, and the obligation of each such Lender
shall be several and not joint, based upon its Applicable Percentage and the
aggregate undrawn amount of such Letter of Credit (as so defined), which shall
be deemed a Syndicated Letter of Credit under this Agreement as of such date.
The Administrative Agent shall, on the Effective Date or promptly thereafter,
notify each beneficiary of such Letter of Credit that is continued hereunder of
the Lenders party thereto, and their respective Applicable Percentages, as of
the Effective Date.

                  SECTION 2.02. ISSUANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. Each Syndicated
Letter of Credit shall be executed and delivered by the Administrative Agent in
the name and on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for, each Lender party to
such Syndicated Letter of Credit, and the Administrative Agent shall act under
each Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall
expressly provide that the Administrative Agent shall act, as the agent of each
Lender to (a) receive drafts, other demands for payment and other documents
presented by the beneficiary under such Syndicated Letter of Credit, (b)
determine whether such drafts, demands and documents are in compliance with the
terms and conditions of such Syndicated Letter of Credit and (c) notify such
Lender and the Account Parties that a valid drawing has been made and the date
that the related LC Disbursement is to be made; PROVIDED that the Administrative
Agent shall have no obligation or liability for any LC Disbursement under such
Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each Syndicated Letter of Credit shall
expressly so provide. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the
Administrative Agent as its attorney-in-fact, acting through any duly authorized
officer of JPMCB, to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of such
Lender each Syndicated Letter of Credit to be issued by such Lender hereunder.
Promptly upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender will furnish
to the Administrative Agent such powers of attorney or other evidence as any
beneficiary of any Syndicated Letter of Credit may reasonably request in order
to demonstrate that the Administrative Agent has the power to act as
attorney-in-fact for such Lender to execute and deliver such Syndicated Letter
of Credit. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Administrative Agent has no responsibility hereunder with respect to the
issuance, renewal, extension, amendment or other administration of any
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, except as expressly set forth in Section
2.06.

                  SECTION 2.03.  REIMBURSEMENT OF LC DISBURSEMENTS, ETC.

                  (a) REIMBURSEMENT. If any Lender shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of any Syndicated Letter of Credit or Alternative
Currency Letter of Credit, regardless of the identity of the Account Party of
such Syndicated Letter of Credit or Alternative Currency Letter of Credit, as
the case may be, the Account Parties jointly and severally agree that they shall
reimburse such Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement under (x) a Syndicated
Letter of Credit by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such
LC Disbursement not later than noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day
that the Account Parties receive notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice
is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the day that the Account Parties receive such notice, if
such notice is not received prior to such time and (y) an Alternative Currency
Letter of Credit, by paying such Lender on the date, in the currency and amount
thereof, together with interest thereon (if any), and in the manner (including
the place of payment) as such Lender and such Account Party shall have
separately agreed pursuant to Section 2.06.

<PAGE>

                                     - 17 -


                  (b) REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Account Parties'
joint and several obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable,
and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of
validity or enforceability of any Syndicated Letter of Credit or any term or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Syndicated
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment
under a Syndicated Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other
document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Syndicated Letter
of Credit (PROVIDED that the Account Parties shall not be obligated to reimburse
such LC Disbursements unless payment is made against presentation of a draft or
other document that at least substantially complies with the terms of such
Syndicated Letter of Credit), (iv) at any time or from time to time, without
notice to any Account Party, the time for any performance of or compliance with
any of such reimbursement obligations of any other Account Party shall be
waived, extended or renewed, (v) any of such reimbursement obligations of any
other Account Party shall be amended or otherwise modified in any respect, or
any guarantee of any of such reimbursement obligations shall be released,
substituted or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with, (vi) the
occurrence of any Default, (vii) the existence of any proceedings of the type
described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VIII with respect to any other Account
Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations, (viii) any lack
of validity or enforceability of any of such reimbursement obligations against
any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement
obligations, or (ix) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this
Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the obligations of any
Account Party hereunder.

                  Neither the Administrative Agent, nor any Lender nor any of
their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or
in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Syndicated Letter of Credit
or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of
the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft,
notice or other communication under or relating to any Syndicated Letter of
Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error
in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes
beyond their control; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to
excuse the Administrative Agent or a Lender from liability to any Account Party
to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims
in respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Parties to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Account Party that are caused by
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or a
Lender. The parties hereto expressly agree that:

                  (i) the Administrative Agent may accept documents that appear
         on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
         Syndicated Letter of Credit without responsibility for further
         investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
         and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such
         Syndicated Letter of Credit;


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 18 -


                  (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have the right, in its
         sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such
         payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
         of such Syndicated Letter of Credit; and

                  (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be
         exercised by the Administrative Agent when determining whether drafts
         and other documents presented under a Syndicated Letter of Credit
         comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to
         the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care
         inconsistent with the foregoing).

                  (c) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Administrative Agent shall,
within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under any Syndicated Letter of
Credit. The Administrative Agent shall promptly after such examination (i)
notify each of the Lenders and the Account Parties by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and (ii) deliver to each Lender a copy of
each document purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Syndicated
Letter of Credit. With respect to any drawing properly made under a Syndicated
Letter of Credit, each Lender will make an LC Disbursement in respect of such
Syndicated Letter of Credit in accordance with its liability under such
Syndicated Letter of Credit and this Agreement, such LC Disbursement to be made
to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for
such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make any
such LC Disbursement available to the beneficiary of such Syndicated Letter of
Credit by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the
account identified by such beneficiary in connection with such demand for
payment. Promptly following any LC Disbursement by any Lender in respect of any
Syndicated Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent will notify the Account
Parties of such LC Disbursement; PROVIDED that any failure to give or delay in
giving such notice shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to
reimburse the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

                  (d) INTERIM INTEREST. If any LC Disbursement with respect to a
Syndicated Letter of Credit is made, then, unless the Account Parties shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made,
the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including
the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Account
Parties reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum equal to (i) 1%
PLUS the Alternate Base Rate to but excluding the date three Business Days after
such LC Disbursement is made and (ii) from and including the date three Business
Days after such LC Disbursement is made, 3% PLUS the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (e) RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION. The Account Parties hereby agree,
as between themselves, that if any Account Party shall pay any reimbursement
obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement with respect to a Syndicated Letter
of Credit issued to support the obligations of another Account Party (the
"SPECIFIED ACCOUNT PARTY"), the Specified Account Party shall, on demand (but
subject to the next sentence), pay to such first Account Party an amount equal
to the amount of such reimbursement. The payment obligation of a Specified
Account Party to another Account Party under this paragraph (e) shall be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 19 -


the prior payment in full of the obligations of the Specified Account Party
under this Agreement and each other Credit Document, and such other Account
Party shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such reimbursement
until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations of the
Specified Account Party.

                  SECTION 2.04.  NON-SYNDICATED LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, at the request of any Account Party the Lenders agree at any time and
from time to time during the Availability Period to issue Non-Syndicated Letters
of Credit for the account of such Account Party in an aggregate amount that will
not result in the Credit Exposure exceeding the Commitments (it being understood
that Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit may be issued, or be outstanding, for the
account of more than one of the Account Parties at any time). Each
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit shall be in such form as is consistent with the
requirements of the applicable regulatory authorities in the jurisdiction of
issue as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise
agreed to by the Administrative Agent and XL Capital. Each Lender shall issue a
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit through the Administrative Agent, in the amount
of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount of Non-Syndicated
Letters of Credit being requested by such Account Party at such time, and each
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit shall be the sole responsibility of such Issuing
Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit may be requested hereunder for any jurisdiction
unless XL Capital provides evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent that Syndicated Letters of Credit do not comply with the
insurance laws of such jurisdiction.

                  (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. To
request the issuance of Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of outstanding Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit), an
Account Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the
Administrative Agent) to the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of the
requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting
the issuance of Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit, or identifying the
Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and
specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, as the case
may be (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Non-Syndicated
Letters of Credit are to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (e) of this
Section), the aggregate amount of all Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit to be
issued in connection with such request, the name and address of the beneficiary
thereof and the terms and conditions of (and such other information as shall be
necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend, as the case may be) such
Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit. If Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit issued in
connection with the same request shall provide for the automatic extension of
the expiry date thereof unless the Issuing Lender thereof or the Administrative
Agent gives notice that such expiry date shall not be extended, then the
Administrative Agent (acting on behalf of the relevant Issuing Lenders) will
give such notice for all such Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit if requested to
do so by the Required Lenders in a notice given to the Administrative Agent not
more than 60 days, but not less than 45 days, prior to the current expiry date
of such Non-Syndicated


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 20 -


Letter of Credit. If requested by the Administrative Agent, such Account Party
also shall submit a letter of credit application on JPMCB's standard form in
connection with any request for a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit. In the event
of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other
agreement submitted by any Account Party to, or entered into by any Account
Party with, the Administrative Agent relating to any Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                  (c) ISSUANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. Each Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit shall be executed and delivered by the Administrative Agent in the name
and on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for, the Issuing Lender party to such
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, and the Administrative Agent shall act under
each Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit
shall expressly provide that the Administrative Agent shall act, as the agent of
the respective Issuing Lender to (i) receive drafts, other demands for payment
and other documents presented by the beneficiary under such Non-Syndicated
Letter of Credit, (ii) determine whether such drafts, demands and documents are
in compliance with the terms and conditions of such Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit and (iii) notify such Lender and the Account Parties that a valid drawing
has been made and the date that the related LC Disbursement is to be made;
PROVIDED that the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation or liability for
any LC Disbursement under such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, and each
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably appoints and designates the Administrative Agent as its
attorney-in-fact, acting through any duly authorized officer of JPMCB, to
execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of such Lender each Non-Syndicated
Letter of Credit to be issued by such Lender hereunder. Promptly upon the
request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender will furnish to the
Administrative Agent such powers of attorney or other evidence as any
beneficiary of any Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit may reasonably request in
order to demonstrate that the Administrative Agent has the power to act as
attorney-in-fact for such Lender to execute and deliver such Non-Syndicated
Letter of Credit.

                  (d) LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNTS. Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon such issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit the
Account Parties shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the aggregate
Credit Exposure of the Lenders shall not exceed the excess, if any, of (A) the
aggregate amount of the Commitments OVER (B) the aggregate stated amount of all
letters of credit identified in Schedule VI (other than Backstopped Letters of
Credit and Replaced Letters of Credit) at the time outstanding and (ii) the sum
of (A) the Credit Exposure (excluding any Alternative Currency LC Exposure) of
each Lender PLUS (B) the aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit
identified in Schedule VI issued by such Lender (other than Backstopped Letters
of Credit and Replaced Letters of Credit) at the time outstanding shall not
exceed the Commitment of such Lender.

                  (e) EXPIRY DATE. Each Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit shall
expire at or prior to the close of business on the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any
renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension).

                  (f) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Non-Syndicated Letter
of Credit (or an amendment to a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit increasing the
amount thereof) by the


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 21 -


respective Issuing Lender, and without any further action on the part of such
Issuing Lender or the Lenders, such Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender
(other than the Issuing Lender itself), and each such Lender hereby acquires
from such Issuing Lender, a participation in such Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for account of the respective Issuing Lender, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by an Issuing Lender
in respect of any Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit promptly upon the request of
the Administrative Agent at any time from the time such LC Disbursement is made
until such LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Account Parties or at any time
after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Account
Parties for any reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset,
abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Promptly following receipt by
the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Account Parties pursuant to the
next following paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment
to the respective Issuing Lender or, to the extent that the Lenders have made
payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Lender, then to
such Lenders and such Issuing Lender as their interests may appear. Any payment
made by a Lender pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Lender for
any LC Disbursement shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (g) REIMBURSEMENT. If any Issuing Lender shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of any Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, regardless of
the identity of the Account Party of such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, the
Account Parties jointly and severally agree that they shall reimburse such
Issuing Lender in respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the
Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than
noon, New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Account Parties
receive notice of such LC Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to
10:00 a.m., New York City time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following
the day that the Account Parties receive such notice, if such notice is not
received prior to such time.

                  If the Account Parties fail to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Account Parties in respect thereof and such
Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.

                  (h) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Account Parties' joint and
several obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements in respect of any
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit as provided in paragraph (g) of this Section
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, or any term or provision
therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Non-Syndicated
Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect,

(iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply strictly
with the terms of such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit (PROVIDED that the
Account Parties shall not be obligated to reimburse such LC Disbursements unless
payment is made against presentation of a draft or other document that at least
substantially complies with the terms of such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit),
(iv) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Account Party, the
time for any performance of or compliance with any of such reimbursement
obligations of any other Account Party shall be waived, extended or renewed, (v)
any of such reimbursement obligations of any other Account Party shall be
amended or otherwise modified in any respect, or any guarantee of any of such
reimbursement obligations shall be released, substituted or exchanged in whole
or in part or otherwise dealt with, (vi) the occurrence of any Default, (vii)
the existence of any proceedings of the type described in clause (g) or (h) of
Article VIII with respect to any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of
such reimbursement obligations, (viii) any lack of validity or enforceability of
any of such reimbursement obligations against any other Account Party or any
guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations, or (ix) any other event or
circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that
might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of the obligations of any Account Party hereunder.

                  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor any Issuing
Lender, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the payment or failure to make
any payment under a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence) as a result of determining
whether drafts or other documents presented under a Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof, or any error, omission, interruption, loss
or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit (including any document
required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical
terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of an Issuing
Lender; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the
Administrative Agent or a Lender from liability to the Account Parties to the
extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in
respect of which are hereby waived by the Account Parties to the extent
permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Account Parties that are caused by
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent or a
Lender when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties
hereto expressly agree that:

                  (i) the Administrative Agent may accept documents that appear
         on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
         Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit without responsibility for further
         investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
         and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such
         Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit;

                  (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have the right, in its
         sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such
         payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
         of such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit; and

                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 23 -


                  (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be
         exercised by the Administrative Agent when determining whether drafts
         and other documents presented under a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit
         comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to
         the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of care
         inconsistent with the foregoing).

                  (i) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Administrative Agent shall,
within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under any Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit. The Administrative Agent shall promptly after such examination (i)
notify each of the Lenders and the Account Parties by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such demand for payment and (ii) deliver to each Lender (including
the Issuing Lender) a copy of each document purporting to represent a demand for
payment under such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit. With respect to any drawing
properly made under a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender
thereof will make an LC Disbursement in respect of such Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit in accordance with its liability under such Non-Syndicated Letter of
Credit and this Agreement, such LC Disbursement to be made to the account of the
Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice
to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent will make any such LC Disbursement
available to the beneficiary of such Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit by promptly
crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account identified by
such beneficiary in connection with such demand for payment. Promptly following
any LC Disbursement by any Issuing Lender in respect of any Non-Syndicated
Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent will notify the Account Parties of
such LC Disbursement; PROVIDED that any failure to give or delay in giving such
notice shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to reimburse
such Issuing Lender with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

                  (j) INTERIM INTEREST. If any LC Disbursement with respect to a
Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit is made, then, unless the Account Parties shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made,
the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including
the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Account
Parties reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum equal to (i) 1%
PLUS the Alternate Base Rate to but excluding the date three Business Days after
such LC Disbursement is made and (ii) from and including the date three Business
Days after such LC Disbursement is made, 3% PLUS the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (k) RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION. The Account Parties hereby agree,
as between themselves, that if any Account Party shall pay any reimbursement
obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement with respect to a Non-Syndicated
Letter of Credit issued to support the obligations of another Account Party (the
"SPECIFIED ACCOUNT PARTY"), the Specified Account Party shall, on demand (but
subject to the next sentence), pay to such first Account Party an amount equal
to the amount of such reimbursement. The payment obligation of a Specified
Account Party to another Account Party under this paragraph (k) shall be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the
obligations of the Specified Account Party under this Agreement and each other
Credit Document, and such other Account Party shall not exercise any right or
remedy with respect to such reimbursement until payment and satisfaction in full
of all of such obligations of the Specified Account Party.

                  SECTION 2.05.  PARTICIPATED LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, in addition to the issuance of Syndicated Letters of Credit provided for
in Section 2.01, any Account Party may request the Issuing Lender to issue, at
any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, Participated
Letters of Credit for its own account. Each Participated Letter of Credit shall
be in such form as is consistent with the requirements of the applicable
regulatory authorities in Illinois, California, Wisconsin or New York as
reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent or as otherwise agreed to by
the Administrative Agent and XL Capital. Participated Letters of Credit issued
hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Commitments.

                  (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. To
request the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit (or the amendment,
renewal or extension of an outstanding Participated Letter of Credit), an
Account Party shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing
Lender) to the Issuing Lender and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in
advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a
notice requesting the issuance of a Participated Letter of Credit, or
identifying the Participated Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or
extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
(which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Participated Letter of
Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (d) of this Section), the
amount of such Participated Letter of Credit, the name and address of the
beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare,
amend, renew or extend such Participated Letter of Credit. If requested by the
Issuing Lender, such Account Party also shall submit a letter of credit
application on the Issuing Lender's standard form in connection with any request
for a Participated Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any
form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by such
Account Party to, or entered into by any Account Party with, the Issuing Lender
relating to any Participated Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this
Agreement shall control.

                  (c) LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNTS. A Participated Letter of Credit
shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Participated Letter of Credit each
Account Party shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure of
the Issuing Lender with respect to Participated Letters of Credit (determined
for these purposes without giving effect to the participations therein of the
Lenders pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section) shall not exceed $50,000,000
and (ii) the Credit Exposure of the Lenders shall not exceed the total
Commitments.

                  (d) EXPIRY DATE. Each Participated Letter of Credit shall
expire at or prior to the close of business on the date one year after the date
of the issuance of such Participated Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any
renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension).

                  (e) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Participated Letter
of Credit (or an amendment to a Participated Letter of Credit increasing the
amount thereof) by the Issuing


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT

                                     - 25 -


Lender, and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or the
Lenders, the Issuing Lender hereby grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby
acquires from the Issuing Lender, a participation in such Participated Letter of
Credit equal to such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Participated Letter of Credit. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant
to this paragraph in respect of Participated Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Participated Letter of
Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments. In consideration and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, for account of the Issuing Lender, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Lender in
respect of any Participated Letter of Credit promptly upon the request of the
Issuing Lender at any time from the time such LC Disbursement is made until such
LC Disbursement is reimbursed by the Account Parties or at any time after any
reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Account Parties for any
reason. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
reduction whatsoever. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of
any payment from the Account Parties pursuant to the next following paragraph,
the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Lender or,
to the extent that the Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to
reimburse the Issuing Lender, then to such Lenders and the Issuing Lender as
their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Lender for any LC Disbursement shall not
relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

                  (f) REIMBURSEMENT. If any Lender shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of any Participated Letter of Credit, regardless of the
identity of the Account Party of such Participated Letter of Credit, the Account
Parties jointly and severally agree that they shall reimburse such Lender in
respect of such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount
equal to such LC Disbursement not later than noon, New York City time, on (i)
the Business Day that the Account Parties receive notice of such LC
Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City
time, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Account
Parties receive such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time.

                  If the Account Parties fail to make such payment when due, the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement,
the payment then due from the Account Parties in respect thereof and such
Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.

                  (g) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The Account Parties' joint and
several obligations to reimburse LC Disbursements in respect of any Participated
Letter of Credit as provided in paragraph (f) of this Section shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Participated
Letter of Credit, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other
document presented under a Participated Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Lender under a
Participated Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other

document that does not comply strictly with the terms of such Participated
Letter of Credit (PROVIDED that the Account Parties shall not be obligated to
reimburse such LC Disbursements unless payment is made against presentation of a
draft or other document that at least substantially complies with the terms of
such Participated Letter of Credit), (iv) at any time or from time to time,
without notice to any Account Party, the time for any performance of or
compliance with any of such reimbursement obligations of any other Account Party
shall be waived, extended or renewed, (v) any of such reimbursement obligations
of any other Account Party shall be amended or otherwise modified in any
respect, or any guarantee of any of such reimbursement obligations shall be
released, substituted or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with,
(vi) the occurrence of any Default, (vii) the existence of any proceedings of
the type described in clause (g) or (h) of Article VIII with respect to any
other Account Party or any guarantor of any of such reimbursement obligations,
(viii) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of such reimbursement
obligations against any other Account Party or any guarantor of any of such
reimbursement obligations, or (ix) any other event or circumstance whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the
provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of the
obligations of any Account Party hereunder.

                  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Lenders nor the Issuing
Lender, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or
responsibility by reason of or in connection with the payment or failure to make
any payment under a Participated Letter of Credit (irrespective of any of the
circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence) as a result of determining
whether drafts or other documents presented under a Participated Letter of
Credit comply with the terms thereof, or any error, omission, interruption, loss
or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication
under or relating to any Participated Letter of Credit (including any document
required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical
terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing
Lender; PROVIDED that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing
Lender from liability to the Account Parties to the extent of any direct damages
(as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
waived by the Account Parties to the extent permitted by applicable law)
suffered by the Account Parties that are caused by the Issuing Lender's gross
negligence or willful misconduct when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under a Participated Letter of Credit comply with the terms
thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that:

                  (i) the Issuing Lender may accept documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a
         Participated Letter of Credit without responsibility for further
         investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
         and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on
         their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such
         Participated Letter of Credit;

                  (ii) the Issuing Lender shall have the right, in its sole
         discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such
         payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
         of such Participated Letter of Credit; and

                  (iii) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be
         exercised by the Issuing Lender when determining whether drafts and
         other documents presented under a


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>
                                     - 27 -


         Participated Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the
         parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
         any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing).

                  (h) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Lender shall, within
a reasonable time following its receipt thereof, examine all documents
purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Participated Letter of
Credit. The Issuing Lender shall promptly after such examination notify the
Administrative Agent and XL Capital by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such
demand for payment and whether the Issuing Lender has made or will make a LC
Disbursement thereunder; PROVIDED that any failure to give or delay in giving
such notice shall not relieve the Account Parties of their obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Lender and the Lenders with respect to any such LC
Disbursement.

                  (i) INTERIM INTEREST. If any LC Disbursement is made with
respect to a Participated Letter of Credit, then, unless the Account Parties
shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is
made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and
including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that
the Account Parties reimburse such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum equal
to (i) 1% PLUS the Alternate Base Rate to but excluding the date three Business
Days after such LC Disbursement is made and (ii) from and including the date
three Business Days after such LC Disbursement is made, 3% PLUS the Alternate
Base Rate. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for account of
the Issuing Lender, except that interest accrued on and after the date of
payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (f) of this Section to reimburse the
Issuing Lender shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such
payment.

                  (j) REPLACEMENT OF THE ISSUING LENDER. The Issuing Lender may
be replaced at any time by written agreement between XL Capital, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Lender and the successor Issuing
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such
replacement of the Issuing Lender. At the time any such replacement shall become
effective, the Account Parties shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for account of
the replaced Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 2.15(e). From and after the
effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Lender shall
have all the rights and obligations of the replaced Issuing Lender under this
Agreement with respect to Participated Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter
and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Lender" shall be deemed to refer
to such successor or to any previous Issuing Lender, or to such successor and
all previous Issuing Lenders, as the context shall require. After the
replacement of an Issuing Lender hereunder, the replaced Issuing Lender shall
remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations
of an Issuing Lender under this Agreement with respect to Participated Letters
of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to
issue additional Participated Letters of Credit.

                  (k) RIGHT OF CONTRIBUTION. The Account Parties hereby agree,
as between themselves, that if any Account Party shall pay any reimbursement
obligation in respect of any LC Disbursement with respect to a Participated
Letter of Credit issued to support the obligations of another Account Party (the
"SPECIFIED ACCOUNT PARTY"), the Specified Account Party shall, on demand (but
subject to the next sentence), pay to such first Account Party an amount equal
to the amount of such reimbursement. The payment obligation of a Specified
Account Party to another


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 28 -


Account Party under this paragraph (k) shall be subordinate and subject in right
of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of the Specified
Account Party under this Agreement and each other Credit Document, and such
other Account Party shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such
reimbursement until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations
of the Specified Account Party.

                  SECTION 2.06.  ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                  (a) REQUESTS FOR OFFERS. From time to time during the
Availability Period, an Account Party may request any or all of the Lenders to
make offers to issue an Alternative Currency Letter of Credit for account of
such Account Party. Each Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such
offers on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to such Lender, and such
Account Party may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers. An
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or
extended only if (and upon such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of
each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit the Account Parties shall be deemed
to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension, the aggregate Credit Exposure of the Lenders shall not
exceed the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments OVER
(ii) the aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit identified in Schedule
VI (other than Backstopped Letters of Credit and Replaced Letters of Credit) at
the time outstanding. Each such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall be
issued, and subsequently, renewed, extended, amended and confirmed, on such
terms as XL Capital, the applicable Account Party and such Lender shall agree,
including, without limitation, expiry, drawing conditions, reimbursement,
interest, fees and provision of cover; PROVIDED that the expiry of any
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit shall not be later than the one-year
anniversary from the date of issuance thereof (or, in the case of any renewal or
extension thereof, one-year after such renewal or extension).

                  (b) REPORTS TO ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Account Parties shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders a report in respect
of each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (an "ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY LETTER
OF CREDIT REPORT") on and as of the date (i) on which such Alternative Currency
Letter of Credit is issued, (ii) of the issuance, renewal, extension or
amendment of a Syndicated Letter of Credit or a Non-Syndicated Letter of Credit,
if any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit is then outstanding and (iii) on
which the Commitments are to be reduced pursuant to Section 2.12, specifying for
each such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (after giving effect to issuance
thereof, as applicable):

                  (A)      the date on which such Alternative Currency Letter of
         Credit was or is being issued;

                  (B)      the Alternative Currency of such Alternative Currency
         Letter of Credit;

                  (C)      the aggregate undrawn amount of such Alternative
         Currency Letter of Credit (in such Alternative Currency);

                  (D) the aggregate unpaid amount of LC Disbursements under such
         Alternative Currency Letter of Credit (in such Alternative Currency);

                                     - 29 -


                  (E)      the Alternative Currency LC Exposure (in Dollars) in
         respect of such Alternative Currency Letter of Credit; and

                  (F) the aggregate amount of Alternative Currency LC Exposures
(in Dollars).

                  Each Alternative Currency Letter of Credit Report shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders by 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on the date on which it is required to be delivered.

                  SECTION 2.07. THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS. Subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Loans to an
Account Party from time to time during the Availability Period in an aggregate
principal amount that will not result in (a) such Lender's outstanding Loans
exceeding such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, (b) such Lender's Credit
Exposures (excluding any Alternative Currency LC Exposure) exceeding such
Lender's Commitment, (c) the total outstanding Loans exceeding the total
Revolving Credit Commitments or (d) the aggregate Credit Exposures of all
Lenders exceeding the aggregate Commitments of all Lenders (it being understood
that Loans may be made, or be outstanding, to more than one of the Account
Parties at any time). Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Account Parties may borrow, prepay and reborrow
Loans.

                  SECTION 2.08.  LOANS AND BORROWINGS.

                  (a) OBLIGATIONS OF LENDERS. Each Loan shall be made as part of
a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Type made by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. The failure of
any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any
other Lender of its obligations hereunder; PROVIDED that the Revolving Credit
Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for
any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required. Loans made hereunder shall
constitute utilization of both the Revolving Credit Commitments and the
Commitments.

                  (b) TYPE OF LOANS. Subject to Section 2.16, each Borrowing
shall be constituted entirely of ABR Loans or of Eurodollar Loans as any Account
Party may request in accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any
Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender to make such Loan; PROVIDED that any exercise of such option shall not
affect the obligation of the Account Parties to repay such Loan in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (c) MINIMUM AMOUNTS; LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF BORROWINGS. Each
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or a larger
multiple of $1,000,000. Each ABR Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount equal
to $10,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000; PROVIDED that an ABR
Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused
balance of the total Revolving Credit Commitments or that is requested to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section
2.03(a). Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time;
PROVIDED that there shall not at any time be more than a total of ten Eurodollar
Borrowings outstanding.

                  (d) LIMITATIONS ON INTEREST PERIODS. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, no Account Party shall be entitled to request (or
to elect to convert to or continue as a Eurodollar Borrowing) any Borrowing if
the Interest Period requested therefor would end after the Maturity Date.

                  SECTION 2.09.  REQUESTS FOR BORROWINGS.

                  (a) NOTICE BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. To request a Borrowing, XL
Capital shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request by telephone (i)

time, three Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing or (ii) in
the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the date of the proposed Borrowing; provided that any such notice of an ABR
Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by
Section 2.03(a) may be given not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the date of the proposed Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall
be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to
the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by
the Administrative Agent and signed by XL Capital.

                  (b)  CONTENT OF BORROWING REQUESTS.  Each telephonic and
written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance
with Section 2.08:

                  (i)    the relevant Account Party;

                  (ii)   the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing;

                  (iii)  the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
         Day;

                  (iv)  whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
         Eurodollar Borrowing;

                  (v) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period
         therefor, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the
         term "Interest Period" and permitted under Section 2.08(d); and

                  (vi) the location and number of such Account Party's account
         to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
         requirements of Section 2.10.

                  (c) NOTICE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO THE LENDERS.
Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

                  (d) FAILURE TO ELECT. If no election as to the Type of a
Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.
If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar
Borrowing, then the requested Borrowing shall be made instead as an ABR
Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.10.  FUNDING OF BORROWINGS.

                  (a) FUNDING BY LENDERS. Each Lender shall make each Loan to be
made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time (or 1:00 p.m., New
York City time with respect to ABR Loans requested by XL Capital no later than
11:00 a.m. on the same day), to the account of the Administrative Agent most
recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the relevant Account
Party by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of such Account Party maintained with the Administrative Agent in New
York City and designated by such Account Party in the applicable Borrowing
Request.

                  (b) PRESUMPTION BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the relevant Account Party a corresponding amount.
In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable
Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and
the relevant Account Party severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Account
Party to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i)
in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case
of such Account Party, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender
pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute
such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.11.  INTEREST ELECTIONS.

                  (a) ELECTIONS BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Loans constituting
each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have the
Interest Period specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the relevant
Account Party may elect to convert such Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different
Type or to continue such Borrowing as a Borrowing of the same Type and, in the
case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect the Interest Period therefor, all as
provided in this Section. The relevant Account Party may elect different options
with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each
such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
constituting such Borrowing, and the Loans constituting each such portion shall
be considered a separate Borrowing.

                  (b) NOTICE OF ELECTIONS. To make an election pursuant to this
Section, XL Capital shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by
telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section
2.09 if XL Capital were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such
election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic
Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly
by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest
Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by XL
Capital.

                                     - 32 -


                  (c) CONTENT OF INTEREST ELECTION REQUESTS. Each telephonic and
written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.08:

                  (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
         applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
         different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
         each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
         pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph shall be specified
         for each resulting Borrowing);

                  (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
         Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (iii)  whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
         Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                  (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
         Interest Period therefor after giving effect to such election, which
         shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest
         Period" and permitted under Section 2.08(d).

                  (d) NOTICE BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO THE LENDERS.
Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative
Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's
portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) FAILURE TO ELECT; EVENTS OF DEFAULT. If XL Capital fails
to deliver a timely and complete Interest Election Request with respect to a
Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor, then,
unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest
Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders,
so notifies XL Capital, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i)
no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar
Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted
to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period therefor.

                  SECTION 2.12.  TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENTS.

                  (a)  SCHEDULED TERMINATION.  Unless previously terminated, the
Commitments shall terminate at the close of business on the Commitment
Termination Date.

                  (b) VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTION. The Account Parties
may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments;
PROVIDED that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that
is $25,000,000 or a larger multiple of $5,000,000 and (ii) the Account Parties
shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments if the Credit Exposure would
exceed the Commitments or the outstanding Loans would exceed the total Revolving
Credit Commitments.

                  (c) NOTICE OF VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OR REDUCTION. XL Capital
shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least three Business Days
prior to the effective date of such


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>
                                     - 33 -


termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by XL
Capital pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; PROVIDED that a notice of
termination of the Commitments delivered by XL Capital may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by XL Capital (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied.

                  (d) EFFECT OF TERMINATION OR REDUCTION. Any termination or
reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the
Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Commitments.

                  SECTION 2.13.  REPAYMENT OF LOANS; TERM-OUT OPTION; EVIDENCE
                                 OF DEBT.

                  (a) REPAYMENT. Each Account Party hereby unconditionally
promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders, (i) in
the event that the Term-Out Option has not been exercised, the outstanding
principal amount of the Loans made to such Account Party on the Commitment
Termination Date and (ii) in the event that the Term-Out Option has been
exercised and is in effect, on the Maturity Date, the then unpaid principal
amount of the Loans made to such Account Party outstanding at the close of
business on the Commitment Termination Date.

                  (b) TERM-OUT OPTION. The Account Parties may, by notice given
by XL Capital to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Lenders) not less than 15 days prior to the Commitment Termination Date, extend
the Maturity Date for all Loans outstanding at the close of business New York
City time on the Commitment Termination Date to the first anniversary of the
Commitment Termination Date (the "TERM-OUT OPTION"); PROVIDED that such
extension shall not be effective with respect to any Lender unless:

                  (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on each
         of the date of the notice requesting such extension and on the
         Commitment Termination Date; and

                  (ii) each of the representations and warranties made by the
         Account Parties in Article IV shall be true and complete on and as of
         each of the date of the notice requesting such extension and the
         Commitment Termination Date with the same force and effect as if made
         on and as of such date (or, if any such representation or warranty is
         expressly stated to have been made as of a specific date, as of such
         specific date).

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Revolving Credit
Commitments of the Lenders to make Loans shall terminate on the Commitment
Termination Date.

                  (c) MANNER OF PAYMENT. Prior to any repayment or prepayment of
any Borrowings hereunder, XL Capital shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to
be paid and shall notify the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) of such selection not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three
Business Days before the scheduled date of such repayment; PROVIDED that each
repayment of Borrowings shall be applied to repay any outstanding ABR Borrowings
before any other Borrowings. If XL Capital fails to make a timely selection of
the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid or prepaid, such payment shall be
applied,

                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 34 -


first, to pay any outstanding ABR Borrowings and, second, to other Borrowings in
the order of the remaining duration of their respective Interest Periods (the
Borrowing with the shortest remaining Interest Period to be repaid first). Each
payment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in such
Borrowing.

                  (d) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS BY LENDERS. Each Lender shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice records evidencing the
indebtedness of each Account Party to such Lender resulting from each Loan made
by such Lender to such Account Party, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (e) MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The
Administrative Agent shall maintain records in which it shall record (i) the
amount of each Loan made to each Account Party hereunder, the Type thereof and
each Interest Period therefor, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due
and payable or to become due and payable from such Account Party to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder for account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (f) EFFECT OF ENTRIES. The entries made in the records
maintained pursuant to paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section shall be PRIMA FACIE
evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
PROVIDED that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
such records or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of the Account Parties to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

                  (g) PROMISSORY NOTES. Any Lender may request that Loans made
by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, each Account Party shall
prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such
Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times
(including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one or
more promissory notes in such form payable to the payee named therein (or, if
such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered
assigns).

                  SECTION 2.14.  PREPAYMENT OF LOANS.

                  (a) RIGHT TO PREPAY BORROWINGS. The Account Parties shall have
the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or
in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

                  (b) NOTICES, ETC. XL Capital shall notify the Administrative
Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in
the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the
case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of
each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; PROVIDED that, if a notice of
prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of
the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.12, then such notice of

                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 35 -


prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance
with Section 2.12. Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents
thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that
would be permitted in the case of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in
Section 2.08. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the
Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.16 and shall be made in the
manner specified in Section 2.13(c).

unused) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding

such Lender ceases to have any Credit Exposure. Accrued facility fees shall be
payable on each Quarterly Date and on (i) in the event the Term-Out Option has
not been exercised, the earlier of the date the Commitments terminate and the

a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

                  (b) UTILIZATION FEE. XL Capital agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a utilization fee at (i) the
rate per annum equal to 0.05% on the amount of the outstanding Loans of such

exercised and is in effect, the utilization fee shall accrue at a rate per annum
equal to 0.10% on the amount of the amount of the outstanding Loans of such
Lender until such Loans are paid in full. Accrued utilization fees shall be
payable on each Quarterly Date and on the earlier of the date the Revolving
Credit Commitments terminate and the Maturity Date; provided that any
utilization fees accruing after such earlier date shall be payable on demand.
All utilization fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day).

                  (c) SYNDICATED LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. XL Capital agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a letter of credit fee
which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to 0.315% on the average daily
aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Syndicated Letters of Credit during

fee which shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to 0.315% on the average daily
aggregate undrawn amount of all outstanding Non-Syndicated Letters of Credit
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
later of the date on which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on
which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, as well as the Administrative

fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable
for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).

                  (e) PARTICIPATED LETTER OF CREDIT FEES. XL Capital agrees to
pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for account of each Lender a participation
fee with respect to its participations in Participated Letters of Credit, which
shall accrue at a rate of 0.315% per annum on the average daily amount of such
Lender's LC Exposure in respect of Participated Letters of Credit (excluding any
portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on
which such Lender's Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender
ceases to have any such LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Lender a fronting
fee, which shall accrue at a rate of 0.125% per annum on the average daily

thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including
each Quarterly Date shall be payable on the third Business Day following such
Quarterly Date, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective
Date; PROVIDED that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the
Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the

Agent.

                  (g) PAYMENT OF FEES. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid
on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent
for distribution, in the case of the facility fees, the utilization fees and the
letter of credit fees referred to in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this Section,
to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any
circumstances.

                  SECTION 2.16.  INTEREST.

                  (a) ABR LOANS. The Loans constituting each ABR Borrowing shall
bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (b) EURODOLLAR LOANS. The Loans constituting each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO
Rate for the Interest Period for such Borrowing PLUS the Applicable Margin.

                  (c) DEFAULT INTEREST. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the
Account Parties hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon
acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as
well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue
principal of any Loan, 2% PLUS the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as
provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% PLUS the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

                  (d) PAYMENT OF INTEREST. Accrued interest on each Loan shall
be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon (i)
in the event the Term-Out Option has not been exercised, the date the
Commitments terminate or (ii) in the event the Term-Out Option has been
exercised, the Maturity Date; PROVIDED that (x) interest accrued pursuant to
paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (y) in the event of
any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan
prior to the later of the Commitment Termination Date and the Maturity Date),
accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on
the date of such repayment or prepayment and (z) in the event of any conversion
of any Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Borrowing shall be payable on the effective date of
such conversion.

                  (e) COMPUTATION. All interest hereunder shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to
the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the
Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in
a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable
Alternate Base

                                     - 38 -


Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the
Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

                  SECTION 2.17.  ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST.  If prior to the
commencement of the Interest Period for any Eurodollar Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines in good faith (which
         determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate
         and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO
         Rate for such Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
         Lenders (acting in good faith) that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such
         Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
         Lenders of making or maintaining their respective Loans included in
         such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to XL Capital and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies XL Capital and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or the
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and such Borrowing (unless prepaid) shall be continued as, or converted to, an
ABR Borrowing and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing,
such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

                  SECTION 2.18.  INCREASED COSTS.

                  (a)  INCREASED COSTS GENERALLY.  If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
         deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
         account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve
         requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

                  (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any
         other condition affecting this Agreement, any Letter of Credit (or any
         participation therein) or any Eurodollar Loan made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining any
participation therein) or Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to
make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the
Account Parties jointly and severally agree that they will pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. If any Lender determines that any
Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the
Letters of Credit issued, or the Loans made, by such Lender to a level


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 39 -


below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's
policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Account Parties will pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) CERTIFICATES FROM LENDERS. A certificate of a Lender
setting forth such Lender's good faith determination of the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be,
as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to XL
Capital and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Account Parties shall
pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof by XL Capital.

                  (d) DELAY IN REQUESTS. Failure or delay on the part of any
Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a
waiver of such Lender's right to demand such compensation; PROVIDED that the
Account Parties shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 90 days prior
to the date that such Lender notifies XL Capital of the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to
claim compensation therefor; PROVIDED FURTHER that, if the Change in Law giving
rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 90 day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof.

                  SECTION 2.19. BREAK FUNDING PAYMENTS. In the event of (a) the
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period therefor (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period therefor, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan
on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of
whether such notice is permitted to be revocable under Section 2.14(b) and is
revoked in accordance herewith), or (d) the assignment as a result of a request
by XL Capital pursuant to Section 2.22(b) of any Eurodollar Loan other than on
the last day of an Interest Period therefor, then, in any such event, the
Account Parties shall compensate each Lender for the loss attributable to such
event. The loss to any Lender attributable to any such event shall be deemed to
be an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i)
the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the
principal amount of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment,
conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest
Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the duration of the Interest Period that would have resulted from such
borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such
deposit were equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period, OVER (ii)
the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on such principal amount for
such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an affiliate of such
Lender) for Dollar deposits from other banks in the eurodollar market at the
commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth such
Lender's good faith determination of any amount or amounts that such Lender is
entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to XL Capital
and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Account Parties shall


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 40 -


pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days
after receipt thereof by XL Capital.

                  SECTION 2.20.  TAXES.

                  (a) PAYMENTS FREE OF TAXES. Any and all payments by or on
account of any obligation of the Account Parties hereunder shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes; PROVIDED that if
any Account Party shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes from such
payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case
may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Account Party shall make such deductions and
(iii) such Account Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) PAYMENT OF OTHER TAXES BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. In
addition, each Account Party shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Account
Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within 10 days
after written demand to XL Capital therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties, interest and
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not
such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to XL Capital by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent
on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive as between such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, and the Account Parties
absent manifest error.

                  (d) EVIDENCE OF PAYMENTS. As soon as practicable after any
payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Account Party to a
Governmental Authority, XL Capital on behalf of such Account Party shall deliver
to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued
by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) EXEMPTIONS. Each Lender and the Administrative Agent
shall, at the written request of XL Capital, provide to any Account Party such
form, certification or similar documentation, if any (each duly completed,
accurate and signed) as is currently required by any Account Party Jurisdiction
or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such other requirements, if any, as is
currently applicable in such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other
jurisdiction, in order to obtain an exemption from, or reduced rate of,
deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes to which
such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to an applicable
tax treaty or the law of such Account Party Jurisdiction or any other


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>
                                     - 41 -


jurisdiction; PROVIDED that XL Capital shall have furnished to such Lender or
the Administrative Agent in a reasonably timely manner copies of such
documentation and notice of such requirements together with applicable
instructions. The Account Parties shall not be required to indemnify any Lender
or the Administrative Agent under Section 2.20(a) or (c) for any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes to the extent such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes would
not be imposed but for the failure by such Lender or the Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, to comply with the provisions of the preceding sentence.
Upon the written request of XL Capital, each Lender and the Administrative Agent
will provide to XL Capital such form, certification or similar documentation
(each duly completed, accurate and signed) as may in the future be required by
any Account Party Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction, or comply with such
other requirements, if any, as may be applicable in such Account Party
Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction in order to obtain an exemption from, or
reduced rate of, deduction, payment or withholding of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes to which such Lender or the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to
an applicable tax treaty or the law of the relevant jurisdiction, PROVIDED that
neither such Lender nor the Administrative Agent shall have any obligation to
provide such form, certification or similar document if it would be unduly
burdensome, would require such Lender or the Administrative Agent to disclose
any confidential information or would otherwise be materially disadvantageous to
such Lender or the Administrative Agent and PROVIDED FURTHER that the Account
Party shall have furnished to such Lender or the Administrative Agent in a
reasonably timely manner copies of such documentation and notice of such
requirements together with applicable instructions.

                  (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its
sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to
which it has been indemnified by an Account Party or with respect to which an
Account Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.20, it
shall pay over such refund to such Account Party (but only to the extent of
indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Account Party under
this Section 2.20 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); PROVIDED, that such Account
Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to
repay the amount paid over to such Account Party (plus any penalties, interest
or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to
its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Account Party or any other Person.

                  SECTION 2.21.  PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING
                                 OF SET-OFFS.

                  (a) PAYMENTS BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Account Parties shall
make each payment required to be made by them hereunder (whether of principal,
interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, interest or fees, or under
Section 2.18, 2.19 or 2.20, or otherwise) or under any other Credit Document
(except to the extent otherwise provided therein) prior to 12:00 noon, New York
City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off
or counterclaim; PROVIDED that any payments in respect of Alternative Currency
Letters of Credit shall be made in the manner (including the time and place of
payment) as shall


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 42 -


have been separately agreed between the relevant Account Party and Lender
pursuant to Section 2.06. Any amounts received after such time on any date may,
in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received
on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest
thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments pursuant to
Sections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 10.03, which shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in Dollars.

                  (b) APPLICATION OF INSUFFICIENT PAYMENTS. If at any time
insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to
pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest
and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and
(ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  (c) PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent otherwise
provided herein: (i) each reimbursement of LC Disbursements (other than in
respect of Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) shall be made to the Lenders,
each Borrowing shall be made from the Lenders, each payment of fees under
Section 2.15 shall be made for account of the relevant Lenders, and each
termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments under Section 2.12
shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata
according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing
shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their
respective Revolving Credit Commitments (in the case of the making of Loans) or
their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of
conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of
principal of Loans by the Account Parties shall be made for account of the
Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of
the Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by an Account
Party shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the
amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective
Lenders.

                  (d) SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or LC Disbursements
(other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of Credit) resulting in
such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of
its Loans and LC Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency
Letters of Credit) and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion
received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion
shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and LC
Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>
                                     - 43 -


Credit) of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and LC
Disbursements (other than with respect to Alternative Currency Letters of
Credit); PROVIDED that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or
any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed to apply to any payment made by any Account Party pursuant to and
in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained
by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
any of its Loans or LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than
to any Account Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the
provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Account Party consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable
law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing
arrangements may exercise against such Account Party rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of such Account Party in the amount of such participation.

                  (e) PRESUMPTIONS OF PAYMENT. Unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from an Account Party prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder
that such Account Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Account Party has made such payment on such date in accordance
herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders
the amount due. In such event, if the relevant Account Party has not in fact
made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (f) CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. If any
Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.21(e), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Administrative Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy such
Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations
are fully paid.

                  SECTION 2.22.  MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

                  (a) DESIGNATION OF A DIFFERENT LENDING OFFICE. If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 2.18, or if any Account Party is required to
pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.20, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Letters of Credit hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or Affiliates, if, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.18 or 2.20, as the
case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender. Each Account Party hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and
expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.

                  (b) REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 2.18, or if any Account Party is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for account of any
Lender pursuant to Section 2.20, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to
fund Loans or to make LC Disbursements hereunder, or if any Lender ceases to be
an NAIC Approved Lender, then XL Capital may, at its sole expense and effort,
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); PROVIDED that (i) XL Capital shall have received the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Loans and LC Disbursements, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the relevant Account Party (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.18 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.20, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender
shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior
thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances
entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                    GUARANTEE

                  SECTION 3.01. THE GUARANTEE. Each Guarantor hereby jointly and
severally guarantees to each Lender and the Administrative Agent and their
respective successors and assigns the prompt payment in full when due (whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and
interest on the Loans and LC Disbursements (and interest thereon) made by the
Lenders to each of the Account Parties (other than such Guarantor in its
capacity as an Account Party hereunder) and all other amounts from time to time
owing to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent by such Account Parties under
this Agreement, in each case strictly in accordance with the terms thereof (such
obligations being herein collectively called the "GUARANTEED Obligations"). Each
Guarantor hereby further jointly and severally agrees that if any Account Party
(other than such Guarantor in its capacity as an Account Party hereunder) shall
fail to pay in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) any of the Guaranteed Obligations, such Guarantor will promptly pay
the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any
extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or
renewal.

                  SECTION 3.02. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of
the Guarantors under Section 3.01 are absolute and unconditional, joint and
several, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity, regularity or
enforceability of the obligations of the Account Parties under this Agreement or
any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any
substitution, release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any
of the Guaranteed Obligations, and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might
otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or
guarantor, it being the intent of this Article that the obligations of the
Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional, joint and several,
under any and all circumstances. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall not alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, which shall
remain absolute and unconditional as described above:

                  (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to the
         Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of
         the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
         compliance shall be waived;

                  (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein
         shall be done or omitted; or

         or any security therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in

The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any
Account Party under this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred
to herein, or against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security
for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  SECTION 3.03. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the Guarantors
under this Article shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that
for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Account Party in respect of
the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any

proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and the Guarantors
jointly and severally agree that they will indemnify the Administrative Agent
and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent or such Lender
in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment

                  SECTION 3.04. SUBROGATION. The Guarantors hereby jointly and
severally agree that until the payment and satisfaction in full of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments
they shall not exercise any right or remedy arising by reason of any performance
by them of their guarantee in Section 3.01, whether by subrogation or otherwise,
against any Account Party or any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

                  SECTION 3.05. REMEDIES. The Guarantors jointly and severally
agree that, as between the Guarantors and the Lenders, the obligations of the
Account Parties under this Agreement may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Article VIII (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in Article VIII) for
purposes of Section 3.01 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or such obligations from becoming
automatically due and payable) as against any Account Party and that, in the
event of such declaration (or such obligations being deemed to have become
automatically due and payable), such obligations (whether or not due and payable
by any Account Party) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors
for purposes of Section 3.01.

                  SECTION 3.06.  CONTINUING GUARANTEE.  The guarantee in this
Article is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Guaranteed Obligations
whenever arising.

                  SECTION 3.07. RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION. The Guarantors (other
than XL Capital) hereby agree, as between themselves, that if any such Guarantor
shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor (as defined below) by reason of the
payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed Obligations, each other Guarantor
(other than XL Capital) shall, on demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but
subject to the next sentence), pay to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount
equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata Share (as defined below and determined, for
this purpose, without reference to the properties, debts and liabilities of such
Excess Funding Guarantor) of the Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of
such Guaranteed Obligations. The payment obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess
Funding Guarantor under this Section shall be subordinate and subject in right
of payment to the prior payment in full of the obligations of such Guarantor
under the other provisions of this Article III and such Excess Funding Guarantor
shall not exercise any right or remedy with respect to such excess until payment
and satisfaction in full of all of such obligations.

                  For purposes of this Section, (i) "EXCESS FUNDING GUARANTOR"
means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, a Guarantor that has paid an
amount in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii)
"EXCESS PAYMENT" means, in respect of any Guaranteed Obligations, the amount
paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of such
Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) "PRO RATA SHARE" means, for any Guarantor, the
ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which the aggregate
present fair saleable value of

all properties of such Guarantor (excluding any shares of stock of any other
Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but
excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any
other Guarantor that have been Guaranteed by such Guarantor) to (y) the amount
by which the aggregate fair saleable value of all properties of all of the
Guarantors (other than XL Capital) exceeds the amount of all the debts and
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Guarantors under this Article
III) of all of the Guarantors (other than XL Capital), determined (A) with
respect to any Guarantor that is a party hereto on the date hereof, as of the
date hereof, and (B) with respect to any other Guarantor, as of the date such
Guarantor becomes a Guarantor hereunder.

                  SECTION 3.08. GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. In
any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state or
Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights
of creditors generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 3.01
would otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Section 3.07, be held or
determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims
of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Section
3.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof to the contrary, the
amount of such liability shall, without any further action by such Guarantor,
any Lender, the Administrative Agent or any other Person, be automatically
limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not
subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

except as such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, examination or similar laws of general applicability
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the application of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

                  SECTION 4.03. GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS. The
Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of (including any

of such Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

                 SECTION 4.04.  FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE.

                  (a) FINANCIAL CONDITION. Such Account Party has heretofore
furnished to the Lenders the consolidated balance sheet and statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of such Account Party and its
consolidated Subsidiaries (A) as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2000 and December 31, 2001, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
independent public accountants (as provided in XL Capital's Report on Form 10-K
filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001), and (B) as of
and for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2002, as provided in XL Capital's
Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for the fiscal quarter ended March 31,
2002. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and results of operations and cash flows of such Account
Party and its respective consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such

its ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties for their intended purposes.

                  (b) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Such Account Party and each of its
Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames,
copyrights, patents and other intellectual property material to its business,

upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 4.06.  LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                  (a) ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS. Except as disclosed in
Schedule III or as routinely encountered in claims activity, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority now pending against or, to the knowledge of such Account Party,
threatened against or affecting such Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries
(i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination
and that could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the
Transactions.

                  (b) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Schedule IV
and except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, neither such Account Party nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to
comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any
permit, license or other approval required for its business under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has incurred any Environmental Liability, (iii) has
received notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv)
knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

                  SECTION 4.07. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND AGREEMENTS. Such
Account Party and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or
its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  SECTION 4.08. INVESTMENT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS. Such
Account Party is not (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company"
as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935.

                  SECTION 4.09. TAXES. Such Account Party and each of its

required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required
to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and for which such Person has set aside on its books
adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 4.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA
Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used
for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as
of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts,
exceed the fair market value of the assets of such Plan by an amount that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

certificates or other information furnished by such Account Party to the Lenders
in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder
(taken as a whole) do not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; PROVIDED that,
with respect to projected financial information, such Account Party represents
only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time.

                  SECTION 4.12. USE OF CREDIT. Neither such Account Party nor
any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose, whether
immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying Margin Stock, and no
Letter of Credit will be used in connection with buying or carrying any Margin
Stock. No part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder will be used to buy or
carry any Margin Stock (except for repurchases of the capital stock of XL
Capital and purchases of Margin Stock in accordance with XL Capital's Statement
of Investment Policy Objectives and Guidelines as in effect on the date hereof
or as it may be changed from time to time by a resolution duly adopted by the
board of directors of XL Capital (or any committee thereof)). The purchase of

each of XL Capital and its Subsidiaries owns, free and clear of Liens, and has
the unencumbered right to vote, all outstanding ownership interests in each
Person shown to be held by it in Schedule V, (y) all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of each such Person organized as a corporation is
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and (z) except as disclosed in
filings of XL Capital with the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no
outstanding Equity Rights with respect to any Account Party.

                  SECTION 4.14. WITHHOLDING TAXES. Based upon information with

principal of and interest on the Loans,

Jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 4.15. STAMP TAXES. To ensure the legality, validity,
enforceability or admissibility in evidence of this Agreement or any promissory
notes evidencing Loans made (or to be made), it is not necessary that this
Agreement or such promissory notes or any other document be filed or recorded
with any Governmental Authority or that any stamp or similar tax be paid on or
in respect of this Agreement, or such promissory notes or any other document
other than such filings and recordations that have already been made and such
stamp or similar taxes that have been paid.

                  SECTION 4.16. LEGAL FORM. Each of this Agreement and any
promissory notes evidencing Loans made (or to be made) is in proper legal form
under the laws of any Account Party Jurisdiction for the admissibility thereof
in the courts of such Account Party Jurisdiction.

such Account Party any obligation in respect of any property leased by such
Account Party or such Subsidiary in addition to such Account Party's obligations
under the applicable document creating such Account Party's or such Subsidiary's

         creditors of such Account Party in any proceeding under the Bermuda
         Companies Law or Bermuda Insurance Law, or any insolvency proceeding,
         liquidation, receivership, rehabilitation, dissolution or winding-up
         involving such Account Party or such Subsidiary;

PROVIDED that, unless and until foreclosure, distraint, levy, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced, such Account Party need not pay or
discharge any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as the
validity thereof is contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted and so long as such reserves or other appropriate
provisions as may be required by GAAP or SAP, as the case may be, shall have
been made therefor and so long as such failure to pay or discharge does not have
a Material Adverse Effect.

Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all
applicable Laws (including but not limited to the Bermuda Companies Law and
Bermuda Insurance Laws) in all respects; PROVIDED that such Account Party or any
Subsidiary of such Account Party will not be deemed to be in violation of this
Section as a result of any failure to comply with any such Law which would not
(i) result in fines, penalties, injunctive relief or other civil or criminal
liabilities which, in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) otherwise impair the ability of such Account Party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.09. USE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PROCEEDS. No part
of the proceeds of any Loan and no Letter of Credit will be used, whether

         a period of 3 or more days;

                  (c) any representation or warranty made or deemed made by any
         Account Party in or in connection with this Agreement or any amendment

         deemed made) or furnished;

                  (d)  any Account Party shall fail to observe or perform any

         due prior to its stated maturity or to terminate its commitment under
         such agreement, PROVIDED that this clause (f) shall not apply to
         secured Indebtedness that becomes due as a result of the voluntary sale

         the entry thereof;

                  (j) an ERISA Event (or similar event with respect to any
         Non-U.S. Benefit Plan) shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the
         Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events and
         such similar events that have occurred, could reasonably be expected to
         result in liability of the Account Parties and their Subsidiaries in an

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to any Account
Party described in clause (g) or (h) of this Article), and at any time
thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may,
and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Account
Parties, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different
times: (i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall
terminate immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and
payable in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be
due and payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon
the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with
accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Account
Parties accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Account Parties; and in case of any event with respect to
any Account Party described in clause (g) or (h) of this Article, the
Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then
outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other
obligations of the Account Parties accrued hereunder, shall automatically become
due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Account Parties.

                  If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and XL
Capital receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
demanding the deposit of cash collateral for the aggregate LC Exposure of all
the Lenders pursuant to this paragraph, the Account Parties shall immediately
deposit into an account established and maintained on the books and records of
the Administrative Agent, which account may be a "securities account" (within
the meaning of Section 8-501 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the
State of New York (the "UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE")), in the name of the
Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal
to the total LC Exposure as of such date PLUS any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon; PROVIDED that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall
become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and
payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default with respect to any Account Party described in clause (g) or
(h) of this Article. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as
collateral for the LC Exposure under this Agreement, and for this purpose each
of the Account Parties hereby grant a security interest to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders in such collateral account and in any
financial assets (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) or other property
held therein.

                  In addition to the provisions of this Article, each Account
Party agrees that upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default any Lender which has issued any Alternative Currency Letter of Credit
may, by notice to XL Capital and the Administrative Agent: (a) declare that all
fees and other obligations of the Account Parties accrued in respect of
Alternative Currency Letters of Credit issued by such Lender shall become due
and payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each Account Party and (b) demand
the deposit (without duplication of any amounts deposited with the
Administrative Agent under the preceding paragraph) of cash collateral from the
Account Parties in immediately available funds in the currency of such
Alternative Currency Letter of Credit or, at the option of such Lender, in
Dollars in an amount equal to the then aggregate undrawn face amount of all such
Alternative Currency Letters of Credit and in such manner as previously agreed
to by the Account Parties and such Lender;

                                     - 64 -


PROVIDED that, in the case of any of the Events of Default specified in clause
(g) or (h) of this Article, without any notice to any Account Party or any other
act by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, all fees and other obligations
of the Account Parties accrued in respect of all Alternative Currency Letters of
Credit shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by each
Account Party. If the Administrative Agent receives any notice from a Lender
pursuant to the previous sentence, then it will promptly give notice thereof to
the other Lenders.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

                  Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with any Account Party or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent
hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders,
and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to any Account Party or any of their Subsidiaries that
is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the
request of the Required Lenders or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by an Account Party or a Lender, and the Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into
(i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document
delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article V


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT

or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required
to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Account Party), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying
the Lenders and the Account Parties. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with XL Capital, to appoint a
successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation shall nonetheless become effective and (1)
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and (2) the Required Lenders shall perform the duties of
the Administrative Agent (and all payments and communications provided to be
made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to
each Lender directly) until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above in this paragraph. Upon the acceptance of
its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
paragraph). The fees payable by XL Capital to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between XL Capital and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance

upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make
its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or
thereunder.

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Sole
Advisor, Lead Arranger, Sole Bookrunner and Co-Syndication Agents named on the
cover page of this Agreement shall not have any duties or liabilities under this
Agreement, except in their capacity, if any, as Lenders.

                  SECTION 10.01. NOTICES. Except in the case of notices and

                  SECTION 10.02.  WAIVERS; AMENDMENTS.

                  (a) NO DEEMED WAIVERS; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or
delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of

exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Account
Parties therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                  (b) AMENDMENTS. Neither this Agreement nor any provision
hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or
agreements in writing entered into by the Obligors and the Required Lenders or
by the Obligors and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required
Lenders; PROVIDED that no such agreement shall:

                  (i)  increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written
         consent of such Lender,

                  (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or the amount of
         any reimbursement obligation of an Account Party in respect of any LC

         Lender affected thereby,

                  (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal
         amount of any Loan or for reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any
         interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount
         of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of
         expiration of any Commitment or any Letter of Credit (other than an
         extension thereof pursuant to an "evergreen" provision"), without the
         written consent of each Lender affected thereby,

                  (iv)  change Section 2.21(c) or 2.21(d) without the consent of
         each Lender affected thereby,

         obligations under Article III without the written consent of each

         percentage in the definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any
         other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
         required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
         determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
         consent of each Lender;

affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent.

                  SECTION 10.03.  EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.

                  (a) COSTS AND EXPENSES. The Account Parties shall pay (i) all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its
Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this
Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of one legal
counsel for the Administrative Agent and one legal counsel for the Lenders, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with
the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including in connection
with any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect thereof and (iii) all
transfer, stamp, documentary or other similar taxes, assessments or charges
levied by any governmental or revenue authority in respect of this Agreement or
any other document referred to herein.

                  (b) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE ACCOUNT PARTIES. The Account
Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
"INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee (but not including
Excluded Taxes), incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of,
in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or the use of the proceeds thereof or any Letter of Credit or the use thereof
(including any refusal by any Lender to honor a demand for payment under a
Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do
not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual
or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
owned or operated by any Account Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to any Account Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
PROVIDED that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
result from or arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee.

                  (c) REIMBURSEMENT BY LENDERS. To the extent that the Account
Parties fail to pay any amount required to be paid by them to the Administrative
Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees
to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; PROVIDED that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in its
capacity as such.

                  (d) WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ETC. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, no Account Party shall assert, and each Account
Party hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result
of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e)  PAYMENTS.  All amounts due under this Section shall be
payable promptly after written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 10.04.  SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a) ASSIGNMENTS GENERALLY. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) no Account
Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by an Account Party without such consent shall be null
and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) ASSIGNMENTS BY LENDERS. (i) Subject to the conditions set
forth in paragraph (b)(ii) of this Section, any Lender may assign to one or more
NAIC Approved Lenders all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans and LC
Disbursements at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                           (A) the Account Parties, PROVIDED that no consent of
         any Account Party shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an
         Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default
         under clause (a), (b), (g) or (h) of Article VIII has occurred and is
         continuing, any other assignee; and

                           (B) the Administrative Agent, PROVIDED that no
         consent of the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment
         to an assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to
         such assignment.

                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
         conditions:

                           (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender,
         an Approved Fund or an Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the
         entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment, the
         amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each such
         assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance
         with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
         Agent) shall not be less than

                                     - 70 -


         $5,000,000 unless each of the Account Parties and the Administrative
         Agent otherwise consent, PROVIDED that no such consent of the Account
         Parties shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (a), (b),
         (g) or (h) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing;

                           (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
         assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement;

                           (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
         deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
         together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

                           (D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
         deliver an Administrative Questionnaire to the Administrative Agent
         (with a copy to XL Capital); and

                           (E) in the case of an assignment to a CLO, the
         assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any amendment,
         modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, PROVIDED
         that the Assignment and Acceptance between such Lender and such CLO may
         provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of such CLO,
         agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first
         proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such CLO.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(v) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19, 2.20 and 10.03). Any assignment or transfer by
a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
paragraph (c) of this Section.

                  (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, any Lender (a "GRANTING Lender") may grant to a special purpose vehicle
(an "SPV") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to
time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Account Parties,
the option to provide to the Account Parties all or any part of any Loan or LC
Disbursement that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to
the Account Parties pursuant to Section 2.01, PROVIDED that (i) nothing herein
shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Loan or LC Disbursement,
(ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide
all or any part of such Loan or LC Disbursement, the Granting Lender shall be
obligated to make such Loan or LC Disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof and
(iii) the Account Parties may bring any proceeding against


                           364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT
<PAGE>

                                     - 71 -


either or both the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of
the Account Parties hereunder. The making of a Loan or LC Disbursement by an SPV
hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same
extent, and as if, such Loan or LC Disbursement were made by the Granting
Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any
payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for
so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender makes such payment.
In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which
agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the
date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding
commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute
against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings
or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof
arising out of any claim against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPV may
with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Account Parties or
the Administrative Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign
all or a portion of its interests in any Loan or Letter of Credit to its
Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Account
Parties and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support
(if any) with respect to commercial paper issued by such SPV to fund such Loans
and to issue such Letters of Credit and such SPV may disclose, on a confidential
basis, confidential information with respect to any Account Party and its
Subsidiaries to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a
surety, guarantee or credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. This paragraph
may not be amended without the consent of any SPV at the time holding Loans or
LC Disbursements under this Agreement.

                  (v) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
agent of the Account Parties, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York
City a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, the Commitment and
Revolving Credit Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to
time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
Account Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Account Party
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

                  (vi) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph
(b)(ii)(C) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required
by paragraph (b)(i) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the
Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless
it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c) PARTICIPATIONS. (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of
the Account

                                     - 72 -


Parties or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including all
or a portion of its Commitment, Revolving Credit Commitment, the Loans and LC
Disbursements owing to it); PROVIDED that (A) any such participation sold to a
Participant which is not a Lender, an Approved Fund or a Federal Reserve Bank
shall be made only with the consent (which in each case shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of XL Capital and the Administrative Agent, unless a
Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case the consent of XL Capital
shall not be required, (B) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and
the other Credit Documents shall remain unchanged, (C) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations and (D) the Account Parties, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the other Credit Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a
Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or the other Credit Documents; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to
Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of
this Section, the Account Parties agree that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Sections 2.18, 2.19 and 2.20 to the same extent as if it were
a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b)
of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.21(d) as though it were a
Lender.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.18 or 2.19 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant or the Lender interest assigned, unless the sale of the
participation to such Participant is made with the Account Parties' prior
written consent.

                  (d) CERTAIN PLEDGES. Any Lender may at any time pledge or
assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release
a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                   (e) NO ASSIGNMENTS TO ANY ACCOUNT PARTY OR AFFILIATES.
Anything in this Section to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may assign
or participate any interest in any Loan or LC Exposure held by it hereunder to
any Account Party or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior
consent of each Lender.

                  SECTION 10.05. SURVIVAL. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Account Parties herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be considered to have been

relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans and the issuance of any
Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party
or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender
may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or
warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in
full force and effect as long as the principal of, or any accrued interest on,
any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is
outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the
Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.18,
2.19, 2.20 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of
Credit and the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 10.06. COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and
any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract between and among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 5.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.07. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability
of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision
in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  SECTION 10.08. RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time
and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender
to or for the credit or the account of any Account Party against any of and all
the obligations of such Account Party now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall
have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be
unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may
have.

                  SECTION 10.09.  GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.

                  (a)  GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be construed in
accordance with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. Each Obligor hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting
in New York County and of the United States District Court of the Southern
District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement against any Obligor or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) WAIVER OF VENUE. Each Obligor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do
so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in
any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

                  (d) SERVICE OF PROCESS. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to
this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  (e) WAIVER OF IMMUNITIES. To the extent that any Account Party
has or hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from
any legal process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution or execution, on the ground of
sovereignty or otherwise) with respect to itself or its property, it hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, such
immunity in respect of its obligations under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 10.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER

AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  SECTION 10.11. HEADINGS. Article and Section headings and the
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken

                  SECTION 10.12.  TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION;
                                  CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  (a) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION. Each of the Account
Parties acknowledge that from time to time financial advisory, investment
banking and other services may be offered or provided to any Account Party or
one or more of their Subsidiaries (in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or affiliates of such
Lender and each of the Account Parties hereby authorizes each Lender to share
any information delivered to such Lender by such Account Party and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of
such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate,
it being understood that (i) any such information shall be used only for the
purpose of advising the Account Parties or preparing presentation materials for
the benefit of the Account Parties and (ii) any such subsidiary or affiliate
receiving such information shall be bound by the provisions of paragraph (b) of
this Section as if it were a Lender hereunder. Such authorization shall survive
the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of
Credit, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of
this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  (b) CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent and the

instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or
any Lender, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by

swap or derivative transaction relating to any Account Party and its
obligations, (vii) with the consent of the Account Parties or (viii) to the
extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of

Account Party after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at
the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders agree that they will
not trade the securities of any of the Account Parties based upon non-public
Information that is received by them.

                  SECTION 10.13. JUDGMENT CURRENCY. This is an international
loan transaction in which the specification of Dollars and payment in New York
City is of the essence, and the obligations of each Account Party under this
Agreement to make payment to (or for account of) a Lender in Dollars shall not
be discharged or satisfied by any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment
expressed in or converted into any other currency or in another place except to
the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by such
Lender in New York City of the full amount of Dollars payable to such Lender
under this Agreement. If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it
is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder in Dollars into another currency (in
this Section called the "JUDGMENT CURRENCY"), the rate of exchange that shall be
applied shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Administrative Agent could purchase such Dollars at the principal office of the
Administrative Agent in New York City with the judgment currency on the Business
Day next preceding the day on which such judgment is rendered. The obligation of
each Account Party in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender hereunder (in this Section called an "ENTITLED PERSON")
shall, notwithstanding the rate of exchange actually applied in rendering such
judgment, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following
receipt by such Entitled Person of any sum adjudged to be due hereunder in the
judgment currency such Entitled Person may in accordance with normal banking
procedures purchase and transfer Dollars to New York City with the amount of the
judgment currency so adjudged to be due; and each Account Party hereby, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees to indemnify
such Entitled Person against, and to pay such Entitled Person on demand, in
Dollars, the amount (if any) by which the sum originally due to such Entitled
Person in Dollars hereunder exceeds the amount of the Dollars so purchased and
transferred.
