A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with   respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.02(g) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest   error. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same   or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of   such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Bor   rowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included   in such Borrowing.

The Administrative   Agent will promptly distribute to each Appropriate Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share   provided for under this Agreement) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such   Lender&#8217;s applicable Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m.,   shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or   fee shall continue to accrue.   (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Busi   ness Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be   reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause   payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in the next succeeding calen   dar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day.   (c) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the   date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrower   or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume   that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall   not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled   thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Administrative Agent in Same   Day Funds, then:   (i) if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall forthwith on de   mand repay to the Administrative Agent the portion of such assumed payment that was made   available to such Lender in Same Day Funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day   from and including the date such amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to such   Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the   applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect; and   (ii) if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall forthwith on de   mand pay to the Administrative Agent the amount thereof in Same Day Funds, together with in   terest thereon for the period from the date such amount was made available by the Administrative   Agent to the Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Administrative Agent (the   &#8220;Compensation Period&#8221;) at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time   to time in effect. When such Lender makes payment to the Administrative Agent (together with   all accrued interest thereon), then such payment amount (excluding the amount of any interest   which may have accrued and been paid in respect of such late payment) shall constitute such   Lender&#8217;s Loan included in the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount   forthwith upon the Administrative Agent&#8217;s demand therefor, the Administrative Agent may make   a demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Adminis   trative Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum   equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.

In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law, upon the occurrence and   during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Lender and its Affiliates (and the Administrative   Agent, in respect of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses payable hereunder) is authorized at any time and   from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the Borrower   (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Loan Party and each of its Subsidiaries) to the fullest extent per-   milled by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,   provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender and   its Affiliates or the Administrative Agent to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties   and their Subsidiaries against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender and its Affiliates or the Ad   ministrative Agent hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective   of whether or not such Agent or such Lender or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement   or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denomi   nated in a currency different from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness. Each Lender agrees   promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made   by such Lender; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and   application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this Section 10.09 are in addi   tion to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Administrative Agent and such   Lender may have at Law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or   agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest   permitted by applicable Law (the &#8220;Maximum Rate&#8221;). If any Agent or any Lender shall receive interest   in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the   Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the inter   est contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person   may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an   expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereot   and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest   throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.   Section 10.11 Counterparts.   This Agreement and each other Loan Document may be executed in one or more counterparts,   each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same in   strument. Delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement and   each other Loan Document shall be effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart of this   Agreement and such other Loan Document.
