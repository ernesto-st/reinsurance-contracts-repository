but Buyer fails to consummate this transaction on the scheduled Closing Date (as defined in Section
10.1) due to default by Buyer and any such default continues for five (5)&nbsp;business days after
written notice from Seller to Buyer, which written notice shall detail such default, Seller shall
be entitled to the Deposit, and all interest thereon, as liquidated damages. The parties have
acknowledged and agreed that Seller&#146;s damages, in the event of a default by Buyer, would be
extremely difficult or impracticable to determine. Therefore, by placing their initials below, the
parties acknowledge that the Deposit, and all interest thereon, has been agreed upon, after
negotiation, as the parties&#146; reasonable estimate of Seller&#146;s damages. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall Seller&#146;s ability to recover from Buyer any loss, cost, damage or
expense pursuant to any indemnification or other provision of this Agreement that survives the
Closing be deemed limited in any respect by this provision or by Seller&#146;s receipt of the Deposit.</B>
The parties agree that the Deposit is not intended as a forfeiture or penalty within the meaning of
California Civil Code Sections&nbsp;3275 or 3369 but shall be treated as liquidated damages pursuant to
California Civil Code Sections&nbsp;1671, 1676 and 1677.

non-performance of any representation, condition, covenant or warranty shall be enforceable unless
in a writing signed by the party entitled to enforce performance, and such signed consent or waiver
shall not be construed as a consent to or waiver of any other breach or non-performance of the same
or any other representation, condition, covenant, or warranty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.6 <U>Attorneys&#146; Fees</U>. In the event of any arbitration or litigation between the
parties, whether based on contract, tort or other cause of action or involving bankruptcy or
similar proceedings, in any way related to this Agreement, the non-prevailing party shall pay to
the prevailing party all reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and costs and expenses of any type, without
restriction by statute, court rule or otherwise, incurred by the prevailing party in connection
with any action or proceeding (including arbitration proceedings, any appeals and the enforcement
of any judgment or award), whether or not the dispute is litigated or prosecuted to final judgment.
The &#147;prevailing party&#148; shall be determined based upon an assessment of which party&#146;s major
arguments or positions taken in the action or proceeding could fairly be said to have prevailed
(whether by compromise, settlement, abandonment by the other party of its claim or defense, final
decision, after any appeals, or otherwise) over the other party&#146;s major arguments or positions on
major disputed issues.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.7 <U>Brokers and Finders</U>. Neither party has had any contact or dealings regarding the
Property, through any licensed real estate broker or other persons who can claim a right to a
commission or finder&#146;s fee in connection with this transaction, except for CB Richard Ellis, Inc.,
representing Seller (the &#147;<B>Selling Broker</B>&#148;) and McKinney Advisory Group, Inc., representing Buyer
(the &#147;<B>Buying Broker</B>&#148;). The parties agree that Seller shall pay a brokerage commission to Selling
Broker, pursuant to its separate agreement with the Selling Broker. The parties agree that Buyer
shall pay any amount owing to Buying Broker pursuant to its separate agreement with the Buying
Broker. In the event that any other party claims a commission or finder&#146;s fee in this transaction,
the party through whom the party makes its claim shall be responsible for said commission or fee
and shall indemnify the other against all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees)
incurred in defending against the same. This indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing
or termination of this Agreement.

shall not disclose such information to any third party, except, in the case of Buyer, to Buyer&#146;s
investment bankers, lender or prospective lenders, insurance and reinsurance firms, accountants,
attorneys, environmental and other consultants, as may be reasonably required for the consummation
of this transaction, as required by law or in connection with any arbitration or litigation between
the parties, and except, in the case of Seller, to Seller&#146;s existing lender, attorneys, accountants
and other professional consultants, as may be reasonably required for the consummation of this
transaction, as required by law or in connection with any arbitration or litigation between the
parties. Neither party shall issue a press release or other public statement about this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the other party&#146;s prior written consent,
