<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(e)&#9;Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made the amount of such Pro Rata Share available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection&nbsp;(a) or (b) of this Section&nbsp;2.02, as applicable, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Pro Rata Share available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay or to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the relevant Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the Administrative Agent, at (i)&nbsp;in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at such time under Section&nbsp;2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii)&nbsp;in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.
