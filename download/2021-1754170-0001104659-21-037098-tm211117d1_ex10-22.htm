</FONT></FONT>Anything to the contrary in this <U>Section 2.1</U> notwithstanding, Agent shall have the right (but not the obligation)
at any time, in the exercise of its Permitted Discretion, to establish and increase or decrease Reserves against the Borrowing
Base or the Maximum Revolver Amount (which shall be reduced thereby). The amount of any Reserve established by Agent, and any changes
to the eligibility criteria set forth in the definitions of Eligible Accounts, Eligible Whole Aircraft Collateral, Eligible Whole
Engine Collateral or Eligible Parts shall have a reasonable relationship to the event, condition, other circumstance, or fact that
is the basis for such reserve or change in eligibility and shall not be duplicative of any other reserve established and currently
maintained or eligibility criteria. Agent shall notify Borrowers at least five Business Days prior to the date on which any such
reserve is to be established or increased or any eligibility criterion is to be changed (during which period Agent shall be available
to discuss any such proposed Reserve or increase, or eligibility criterion change, with Borrowers and Borrowers may take such action
as may be required so that the event, condition or matter that is the basis for such Reserve or increase, or eligibility criterion
change, no longer exists, in a manner and to the extent reasonably satisfactory to Agent); <U>provided further</U>, that (i) the
Borrowers may not obtain any new Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans) or Letters of Credit to the extent that such Revolving
Loan (including Swing Loans) or Letter of Credit would cause an Overadvance after giving effect to the establishment or increase
of such Reserve, or change to eligibility criterion, as set forth in such notice, (ii) no such prior notice shall be required for
changes to any Reserves or eligibility criteria resulting solely by virtue of mathematical calculations of the amount of the Reserve
or eligibility criterion in accordance with the methodology of calculation set forth in this Agreement or previously utilized,
(iii) no such prior notice shall be required during the continuance of any Event of Default and (iv) no such prior notice shall
be required with respect to any Reserve established in respect of any Lien that has priority over Agent&#8217;s Liens on the Collateral.</P>

Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in immediately
available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. If, on the requested Funding Date, any Lender shall not have remitted the full

If any Lender shall not remit the full amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds
as and when required hereby and if Agent has made available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to

Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall pay such amount to Agent for
Agent&#8217;s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per

transfer in immediately available funds to a Deposit Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that

any Lender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover
for its account such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.</P>

the Defaulting Lender, (D) fourth, to each Non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each
case, only to the extent that such Defaulting Lender&#8217;s portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was
funded by such other Non-Defaulting Lender), (E) fifth, in Agent&#8217;s sole discretion, to a suspense account maintained by
Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may be made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of
Borrowers (upon the request of Borrowers and subject to the conditions set forth in <U>Section 3.2</U>) as if such Defaulting

date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with tier (L) of <U>Section
2.4(b)(iii)</U>. Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers for the account of
such Defaulting Lender the amount of all such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting
Lender. Solely for the purposes of voting or consenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the
calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and for the purpose of calculating the fee payable under <U>Section
2.10(b)</U>, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a &#8220;Lender&#8221; and such Lender&#8217;s Commitment shall
be deemed to be zero; <U>provided</U>, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the matters governed by <U>Section
14.1(a)(i)</U> through <U>(iii)</U>. The provisions of this <U>Section 2.3(g)</U> shall remain effective with respect to such
Defaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, Issuing Bank, and
Borrowers shall have waived, in writing, the application of this <U>Section 2.3(g)</U> to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the
date on which such Defaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Agent all
amounts owing by Defaulting Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested by
Agent, provides adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier date, so long
as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by Agent pursuant to <U>Section
2.3(g)(ii)</U> shall be released to Borrowers). The operation of this <U>Section 2.3(g)</U> shall not be construed to
increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or excuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or
any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse the performance by any Borrower of its
duties and obligations hereunder to Agent, Issuing Bank, or to the Lenders other than such Defaulting Lender. Any failure by
a Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a material breach by such
Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Borrowers, at their option, upon written notice to Agent, to arrange
for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be reasonably
acceptable to Agent. In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no
right to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in
favor of the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails
to do so) subject only to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations, but
including (1) all interest, fees, and other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (2) an assumption of
its Pro Rata Share of its participation in the Letters of Credit); <U>provided</U>, that any such assumption of the
Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups&#8217; or
Borrowers&#8217; rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of or in relation to such failure to fund.
In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this <U>Section 2.3(g)</U> and any other provision
contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be
read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual,
irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this <U>Section 2.3(g)</U> shall

text submitted by Borrowers. Borrowers understand that the final form of any Letter of Credit may be subject to such revisions
and changes as are deemed necessary or appropriate by Issuing Bank, and Borrowers hereby consent to such revisions and changes
not materially different from the application executed in connection therewith. Borrowers are solely responsible for the suitability
of the Letter of Credit for Borrowers&#8217; purposes. If Borrowers request Issuing Bank to issue a Letter of Credit for an affiliated
or unaffiliated third party (an &#8220;<U>Account Party</U>&#8221;), (i) such Account Party shall have no rights against Issuing
Bank; (ii) Borrowers shall be responsible for the application and obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) communications (including
notices) related to the respective Letter of Credit shall be among Issuing Bank and Borrowers. Borrowers will examine the copy
of the Letter of Credit and any other documents sent by Issuing Bank in connection therewith and shall promptly notify Issuing
Bank (not later than three (3) Business Days following Borrowers&#8217; receipt of documents from Issuing Bank) of any non-compliance
with Borrowers&#8217; instructions and of any discrepancy in any document under any presentment or other irregularity. Borrowers
understand and agree that Issuing Bank is not required to extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit for any reason. With
respect to any Letter of Credit containing an &#8220;automatic amendment&#8221; to extend the expiration date of such Letter of
Credit, Issuing Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, may give notice of nonrenewal of such Letter of Credit and, if Borrowers
do not at any time want the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit to be extended, Borrowers will so notify Agent
and Issuing Bank at least 30 calendar days before Issuing Bank is required to notify the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or
any advising bank of such non-extension pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit.</P>

the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense (legal or equitable), set-off, counterclaim, or claim which each
Borrower may now or at any time hereafter have against any other Borrower or any other party liable to any member of the

election of remedies by any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider including any defense based upon an
impairment or elimination of such Borrower&#8217;s rights of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity of such
Borrower against any other Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower hereby assents to, and
waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any
payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or
acquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or
satisfaction of any term, covenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by
Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the Obligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in

in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents to any other action or
delay in acting or failure to act on the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply
with any of its respective Obligations, including any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any
remedy or to comply fully with applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this <U>Section
2.15</U> afford grounds for terminating, discharging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its
Obligations under this <U>Section 2.15</U>, it being the intention of each Borrower that, so long as any of the Obligations
hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each Borrower under this <U>Section 2.15</U> shall not be discharged except
by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this <U>Section
2.15</U> shall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation,
reconstruction or similar proceeding with respect to any other Borrower or any Agent or Lender. Each of the Borrowers waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the
enforcement hereof. Any payment by any Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to
any Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each of the Borrowers. Each of the Borrowers waives any
defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Person, other than payment of the Obligations to
the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Borrower or any other Person, or the validity,
legality, or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of any Borrower other than payment of the Obligations to the extent of such payment. Agent may, at the election of
the Required Lenders, foreclose upon any Collateral held by Agent by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales or other
dispositions, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable or otherwise fails to comply with
applicable law or may exercise any other right or remedy Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product
Provider may have against any Borrower or any other Person, or any security, in each case, without affecting or impairing in
any way the liability of any of the Borrowers hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid.</P>

all Plans sponsored or maintained by an ERISA Affiliate the operating of which could lead to a liability of any Borrower which
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Copies of all such Title IV Plans; together with a copy of the
latest form IRS/DOL 5500-series for each such Title IV Plan have been made available to Agent. Each Qualified Plan has been determined
by the IRS to qualify under Section 401 of the IRC (or has been adapted using a prototype plan document that has been approved
by the IRS), the trusts created thereunder have been determined to be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section 501 of the
IRC, and, to each Borrower&#8217;s knowledge, nothing has occurred that would cause the loss of such qualification or tax&#45;exempt
status. Each Plan is in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the IRC, except to the extent any such non-compliance
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Borrower or ERISA Affiliate has failed to make any contribution
or pay any amount due as required by either Section 412 of the IRC or Section 302 of ERISA or the terms of any such Plan, except
to the extent any such failure could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Borrower has engaged in,
or assumed any liability in connection with, a non-exempt &#8220;<U>prohibited transaction,</U>&#8221; as defined in Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the IRC, in connection with any Plan, that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.</P>

Revolving Loan (and the principal amount thereof and stated interest thereon) held by such Lender (each, a
 &#8220;<U>Registered Loan</U>&#8221;). Other than in connection with an assignment by a Lender of all or any portion of its
portion of a Revolving Loan to an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender (i) a Registered Loan (and the
registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or in part only by registration of such
assignment or sale on the Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide) and (ii) any assignment or sale of
all or part of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by
registration of such assignment or sale on the Register, together with the surrender of the registered note, if any,
evidencing the same duly endorsed by (or accompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by) the
holder of such registered note, whereupon, at the request of the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new
registered notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated assignee(s) or transferee(s). Prior
to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any evidencing the same),
Borrowers shall treat the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) is
registered as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary. In the case of any assignment by a Lender of all or any portion of its Revolving Loan to an Affiliate
of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender, and which assignment is not recorded in the Register, the assigning Lender,
on behalf of Borrowers, shall maintain a register comparable to the Register. This <U>Section 13.1(h)</U> shall be construed
so that all Loans are at all times maintained in &#8220;registered form&#8221; within the meaning of Sections 163(f),
871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the IRC and any related regulations of the United States Treasury Department (or any other
relevant or successor provisions of the IRC or of such United States Treasury Regulations).</P>

</FONT></FONT>In the event that a Lender sells participations in the Registered Loan, such Lender, as a non-fiduciary agent on
behalf of Borrowers, shall maintain (or cause to be maintained) a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the
Registered Loans held by it (and the principal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of such Registered Loans that
is subject to such participations) (the &#8220;<U>Participant Register</U>&#8221;). A Registered Loan (and the registered note,
if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the Participant
Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide). Any participation of such Registered Loan (and the registered note,
if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. No Lender
shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant
or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations
under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment,
loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.
The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding
any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining
a Participant Register.</P>

</B></FONT></FONT><B><U>Appointment and Authorization of Agent</U></B>. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells Fargo
as its agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering
into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to designate, appoint, and authorize) Agent to execute
and deliver each of the other Loan Documents on its behalf and to take such other action on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to
Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Agent agrees to act as agent for and on behalf of the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers) on the conditions contained in
this <U>Section 15.</U> Any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document notwithstanding,
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents, nor
shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender (or Bank Product Provider), and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; in this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only a representative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each Lender hereby
further authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent
to act as the secured party under each of the Loan Documents that create a Lien on any item of Collateral. Except as expressly
otherwise provided in this Agreement, Agent shall have and may use its sole discretion with respect to exercising or refraining
from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that Agent expressly is entitled to take
or assert under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the
right to exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect: (a) maintain, in accordance with its customary
business practices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, payments and proceeds of Collateral,
and related matters, (b) execute or file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements,
documents, instruments, proofs of claim, notices and other written agreements with respect to the Loan Documents, or to take any
other action with respect to any Collateral or Loan Documents which may be necessary to perfect, and maintain perfected, the security
interests and Liens upon Collateral pursuant to the Loan Documents, (c) make Revolving Loans, for itself or on behalf of Lenders,
as provided in the Loan Documents, (d) exclusively receive, apply, and distribute payments and proceeds of the Collateral as provided
in the Loan Documents, (e) open and maintain such bank accounts and cash management arrangements as Agent deems necessary and
appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the foregoing purposes, (f)&nbsp;perform, exercise, and enforce any and
all other rights and remedies of the Lender Group with respect to any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries, the Obligations, the Collateral,
or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Loan Documents, and (g) incur and pay such Lender Group Expenses as Agent
may deem necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions and powers pursuant to the Loan Documents.</P>

and is continuing) prior written notice to the Lenders (unless such notice is waived by the Required Lenders) and Borrowers (unless
such notice is waived by Borrowers or a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) and without any notice to
the Bank Product Providers. If Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall be entitled, with (so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the consent of Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed,
or conditioned), appoint a successor Agent for the Lenders (and the Bank Product Providers). If, at the time that Agent&#8217;s
resignation is effective, it is acting as Issuing Bank or the Swing Lender, such resignation shall also operate to effectuate
its resignation as Issuing Bank or the Swing Lender, as applicable, and it shall automatically be relieved of any further obligation
to issue Letters of Credit, or to make Swing Loans. If no successor Agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation
of Agent, Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and Borrowers, a successor Agent. If Agent has materially breached
or failed to perform any material provision of this Agreement or of applicable law, the Required Lenders may agree in writing
to remove and replace Agent with a successor Agent from among the Lenders with (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing) the consent of Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned). In any such event,
upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers,
and duties of the retiring Agent and the term &#8220;Agent&#8221; shall mean such successor Agent and the retiring Agent&#8217;s
appointment, powers, and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this <U>Section 15</U> shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under this Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following
a retiring Agent&#8217;s notice of resignation, the retiring Agent&#8217;s resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective
and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lenders appoint a successor
Agent as provided for above.</P>

sold or disposed of if a release is required or desirable in connection therewith and if Borrowers certify to Agent that the

further inquiry), (iii) constituting property in which no Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries owned any interest at the

Party or its Subsidiaries under a lease or license that has expired or is terminated in a transaction permitted under this

The Loan Parties and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product Agreement, each Bank
Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, to (a) consent to
the sale of, credit bid, or purchase (either directly or indirectly through one or more entities) all or any portion of the
Collateral at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 of the Bankruptcy

connection with any such credit bid or purchase, (i) the Obligations owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers shall

claims being estimated for such purpose if the fixing or liquidation thereof would not impair or unduly delay the ability of
Agent to credit bid or purchase at such sale or other disposition of the Collateral and, if such contingent or unliquidated
claims cannot be estimated without impairing or unduly delaying the ability of Agent to credit bid at such sale or other
disposition, then such claims shall be disregarded, not credit bid, and not entitled to any interest in the Collateral that
is the subject of such credit bid or purchase) and the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers whose Obligations are credit

the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) in the Collateral that is the subject of such credit bid or purchase (or
in the Equity Interests of the any entities that are used to consummate such credit bid or purchase), and (ii) Agent, based
upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, may accept non-cash consideration, including debt and equity securities issued
by any entities used to consummate such credit bid or purchase and in connection therewith Agent may reduce the Obligations
owed to the Lenders and the Bank Product Providers (ratably based upon the proportion of their Obligations credit bid in
relation to the aggregate amount of Obligations so credit bid) based upon the value of such non-cash consideration; <U>provided</U>,
that Bank Product Obligations not entitled to the application set forth in <U>Section 2.4(b)(iii)(J)</U> shall not be
entitled to be, and shall not be, credit bid, or used in the calculation of the ratable interest of the Lenders and Bank
Product Providers in the Obligations which are credit bid. Except as provided above, Agent will not execute and deliver a

substantially all of the Collateral, all of the Lenders (without requiring the authorization of the Bank Product Providers),

15.11</U>; <U>provided</U>, that (1) anything to the contrary contained in any of the Loan Documents notwithstanding, Agent
shall not be required to execute any document or take any action necessary to evidence such release on terms that, in
Agent&#8217;s opinion, could expose Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the
release of such Lien without recourse, representation, or warranty, and (2) such release shall not in any manner discharge,
affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly released) upon (or obligations of Borrowers in
respect of) any and all interests retained by any Borrower, including, the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue
to constitute part of the Collateral. Each Lender further hereby irrevocably authorize (and by entering into a Bank Product

applies (and Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform each Irish Borrower). For the avoidance of doubt, an Assignment
and Acceptance shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender or Participant, as the case may be, to comply with this Section.
A Lender or Participant, as the case may be, shall promptly notify Agent of any change in its status as an Irish Qualifying Lender
(and Agent, upon receipt of such notification, shall inform each Irish Borrower). Each Lender or Participant, as the case may
be, upon request from the Irish Borrower or Agent from time to time, shall as soon as reasonably practicable provide such information
as may be required for the purposes of sections 891A, 891E, 891F and 891G TCA (and any regulations made thereunder).</P>

</B></FONT></FONT><B><U>Bank Product Providers</U></B>. Each Bank Product Provider in its capacity as such shall be deemed a third
party beneficiary hereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to
the parties for whom Agent is acting. Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product Providers and, by virtue of entering
into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have appointed Agent as its
agent and to have accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents. It is understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of each
Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider&#8217;s being a beneficiary of
the Liens and security interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent and the right to share in payments and collections
out of the Collateral as more fully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank
Product Agreement, shall be automatically deemed to have agreed that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation,
to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of the Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established
there is no obligation on the part of Agent to determine or insure whether the amount of any such reserve is appropriate or not.
In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are
due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written certification (setting forth
a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification is received
by Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution. Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the
amount due and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable
from the applicable Bank Product Provider. In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that
the amount due and payable to the applicable Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by such Bank Product
Provider as being due and payable (less any distributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof). Borrowers may
obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider, although Borrowers are not required to do so. Each Borrower acknowledges
and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide any Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by
any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank Product Provider. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank Product shall have any voting or approval
rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such agreements or products
or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their capacities
as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter
relating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors.</P>

in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall have received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that such appointment
has been revoked and that another Borrower has been appointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints
and authorizes the Administrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all notices with respect to Revolving Loans and Letters of
Credit obtained for the benefit of any Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (and any notice or instruction provided by Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to be given by Borrowers hereunder
and shall bind each Borrower), (b) to receive notices and instructions from members of the Lender Group (and any notice or instruction
provided by any member of the Lender Group to the Administrative Borrower in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed
to have been given to each Borrower), (c) to enter into Bank Product Provider Agreements on behalf of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries,
(d) to execute the Fee Letter on behalf of all Borrowers and (e) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate
on its behalf to obtain Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. It is understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined
fashion, as more fully set forth herein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the collective borrowing
powers of Borrowers in the most efficient and economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur liability
to any Borrower as a result hereof. Each Borrower expects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the
Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the successful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued
successful performance of the integrated group. To induce the Lender Group to do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower
hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold each member of the Lender Group harmless
against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender Group by any Borrower or by
any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (i)&nbsp;the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral of Borrowers
as herein provided, or (ii) the Lender Group&#8217;s relying on any instructions of the Administrative Borrower<B><I>, </I></B>except
that Borrowers will have no liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under this <U>Section 17.13

from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person, as the case may be.</P>
