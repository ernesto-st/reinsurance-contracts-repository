(acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for

provided by Law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each
Lender and its Affiliates is authorized at any time and from time to time, without prior notice to
the Company or any other Loan Party, any such notice being waived by the Company (on its own behalf
and on behalf of each Loan Party and its Subsidiaries) to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender
and its Affiliates to or for the credit or the account of the respective Loan Parties and their
Subsidiaries against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender and its Affiliates hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not such Agent
or such Lender or Affiliate shall have made demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different
from that of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness; <I>provided </I>that, in the case of any such
deposits or other Indebtedness for the credit or the account of any Foreign Subsidiary, such set
off may only be against any Obligations of Foreign Subsidiaries. Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify the Company and the Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such
Lender; <I>provided</I>, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff
and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent and each Lender under this Section&nbsp;10.09
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the
Administrative Agent and such Lender may have. Notwithstanding anything herein or in any other
Loan Document to the contrary, in no event shall the assets of any Foreign Subsidiary that is not a
Loan Party constitute collateral security for payment of the Obligations of the Company or any
Domestic Subsidiary, it being understood that (a)&nbsp;the Equity Interests of any Foreign Subsidiary
that is not a Loan Party do not constitute
such an asset and (b)&nbsp;the provisions hereof shall not limit, reduce or otherwise diminish in
any respect the Borrowers&#146; obligations to make any mandatory prepayment pursuant to Section
