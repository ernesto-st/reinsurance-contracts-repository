         Borrowing Date of each Swing Line Loan, specifying (i) the applicable
         Borrowing Date (which date shall be a Business Day), and (ii) the
         aggregate amount of the requested Swing Line Loan which shall be an
         amount not less than $100,000. The Swing Line Loans shall bear interest
         at the Floating Rate or at such other rate as is agreed upon by the
         Borrower and the Swing Line Lender.

                  2.4.3 Making of Swing Line Loans. Promptly after receipt of a
         Swing Line Borrowing Notice, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
         Lender by fax or other similar form of transmission, of the requested
         Swing Line Loan. Not later than 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the
         applicable Borrowing Date, the Swing Line Lender shall make available
         the Swing Line Loan, in funds immediately available in New York City,
         to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to
         Article XIII. The Administrative Agent will promptly make the funds so
         received from the Swing Line Lender available to the Borrower on the
         Borrowing Date at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

                  2.4.4 Repayment of Swing Line Loans. Each Swing Line Loan
         shall be paid in full by the Borrower on or before the fifth (5th)
         Business Day after the Borrowing Date for such Swing Line Loan. In
         addition, the Swing Line Lender (i) may at any time in its sole
         discretion with respect to any outstanding Swing Line Loan, or (ii)
         shall, on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Borrowing Date of any
         Swing Line Loan, require each Lender (including the Swing Line Lender)
         to make a Revolving Loan in the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share
         of such Swing Line Loan (including, without limitation, any interest
         accrued and unpaid thereon), for the purpose of repaying such Swing
         Line Loan. Not later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of
         any notice received pursuant to this Section 2.4.4 (or the immediately
         following Business Day if such notice is received after 11 a.m. (New
         York City time)), each Lender shall make available its required
         Revolving Loan, in funds immediately available in New York City to the
         Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII.
         Revolving Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.4.4 shall initially be
         Floating Rate Loans and thereafter may be continued as Floating Rate
         Loans or converted into Eurodollar Loans in the manner provided in
         Section 2.9 and subject to the other conditions and limitations set
         forth in Article II. Unless a Lender shall have notified the Swing Line
         Lender, prior to its making any Swing Line Loan, that any applicable
         condition precedent set forth in Sections 4.1 or 4.2 had not been
         satisfied, such Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to
         this Section 2.4.4 to repay Swing Line Loans shall be unconditional,
         continuing, irrevocable and absolute and shall not be affected by any
         circumstances, including, without limitation, (a) any set-off,
         counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may
         have against the Swing Line Lender or any other Person, (b) the
         occurrence or continuance of a Default or Unmatured Default, (c) any
         adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the
         Borrower, or (d) any other circumstances, happening or event
         whatsoever. In the event that any Lender fails to make payment to the
         Administrative Agent of any amount due under this Section 2.4.4, the
         Administrative Agent shall be entitled to receive, retain and apply
         against such obligation the principal and interest otherwise payable to
         such Lender hereunder until the Administrative Agent receives such
         payment from such Lender or such obligation is otherwise fully
         satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, if for any reason any Lender

                                       31
<PAGE>

         fails to make payment to the Administrative Agent of any amount due
         under this Section 2.4.4, such Lender shall be deemed, at the option of
         the Administrative Agent, to have unconditionally and irrevocably
         purchased from the Swing Line Lender, without recourse or warranty, an
         undivided interest and participation in the applicable Swing Line Loan
         in the amount of such Revolving Loan, and such interest and
         participation may be recovered from such Lender together with interest
         thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for each day during the
         period commencing on the date of demand and ending on the date such
         amount is received. On the Revolving Loan Termination Date, the
         Borrower shall repay in full the outstanding principal balance of the
         Swing Line Loans.

         2.5. Commitment Fee; Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment; Letter of
Credit Facility.

                  2.5.1 Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
         Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders in accordance with
         their Revolving Loan Pro Rata Shares, from and after the Closing Date
         until the date on which the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment shall
         be terminated in whole, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee")
         accruing at the rate of the then Applicable Fee Rate on the Available
         Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment in effect from time to time;
         provided, however, that any Commitment Fee accrued with respect to any
         of the Revolving Loan Commitments of a Defaulting Lender during the
         period prior to the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and
         unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrower so long as
         such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to the extent that such
         Commitment Fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the
         Borrower prior to such time; and provided further that no Commitment
         Fee shall accrue on any of the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender so
         long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. All such Commitment
         Fees payable hereunder shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each
         Payment Date; provided, that if any Lender continues to have
         Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure after the termination of its
         Revolving Loan Commitment, then the Commitment Fee shall continue to
         accrue and be due and payable pursuant to the terms hereof until such
         Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure is reduced to zero.

                  2.5.2 Reductions in Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment. The
         Borrower may permanently reduce the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment
         in whole, or in part, ratably among the Lenders in the minimum amount
         of $5,000,000 (and in multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), upon
         at least three (3) Business Days' written notice to the Administrative
         Agent, which notice shall specify the amount of any such reduction,
         provided, however, that the amount of the Aggregate Revolving Loan
         Commitment may not be reduced below the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving
         Credit Exposure. All accrued Commitment Fees shall be payable on the

                                       32
<PAGE>

         effective date of any termination of the obligations of the Lenders to
         make Credit Extensions hereunder and on the final date upon which all
         Loans are repaid.

                  2.5.3 Reductions in Letter of Credit Facility. (a) The
         Borrower may permanently reduce the LC Sublimit in whole, or in party,
         ratably among the LC Issuers in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 (and
         in multiples of $1,000,000), upon at least three (3) Business Days'
         written notice to the Administrative Agent, which notice shall specify
         the amount of any such reduction, provided however that the amount of
         the LC Sublimit may not be reduced below the aggregate amount of the LC
         Obligations.

                  (b) The LC Commitment of Bank One will permanently reduce upon
         the cancellation, expiration or other termination or release of the
         liabilities of Bank One, NA with respect to the Existing Letters of
         Credit, to the extent of such cancellation, expiration or other
         termination or release of liabilities.

         2.6. Minimum Amount of Each Advance. Each Eurodollar Advance shall be
in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 (and in multiples of $500,000 if in excess
thereof), and each Floating Rate Advance (other than an Advance to repay Swing
Line Loans) shall be in the minimum amount of $1,000,000 (and in multiples of
$500,000 if in excess thereof), provided, however, that any Floating Rate
Advance may be in the amount of the Adjusted Available Aggregate Revolving Loan
Commitment.

         2.7. Optional Principal Payments. The Borrower may from time to time
pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Floating Rate Advances (other
than Swing Line Loans), or any portion of the outstanding Floating Rate Advances
(other than Swing Line Loans), in a minimum aggregate amount of $500,000 or any
integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, in each case upon two (2)
Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower may at any
time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Swing Line Loans, or, in a
minimum amount of $100,000 and increments of $50,000 in excess thereof, any
portion of the outstanding Swing Line Loans, with notice to the Administrative
Agent and the Swing Line Lender by 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date of
repayment. The Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment of any
funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4 but without penalty or
premium, all outstanding Eurodollar Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount
of $1,000,000 or any integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, any
portion of the outstanding Eurodollar Advances upon three (3) Business Days'
prior notice to the Administrative Agent.

         2.8. Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New Advances.
The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each
Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period applicable thereto from time to time;
provided that there shall be no more than 5 Interest Periods in effect with
respect to all of the Loans at any time, unless such limit has been waived by
the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") not later than
2:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least one Business Day before the Borrowing
Date of each Floating Rate Advance (other than a Swing Line Loan) and three
Business Days before the Borrowing Date for each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

                                       33
<PAGE>

                  (i) the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
         Advance,

                  (ii) the aggregate amount of such Advance,

                  (iii) the Type of Advance selected, and

                  (iv) in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest
         Period applicable thereto.

Not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on each Borrowing Date, each
Lender shall make available its Loan or Loans in Federal or other funds
immediately available in New York City to the Administrative Agent at its
address specified pursuant to Article XIII. The Administrative Agent will
promptly make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower
at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

         2.9. Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances; No Conversion
or Continuation of Eurodollar Advances After Default. Floating Rate Advances
(other than Swing Line Advances) shall continue as Floating Rate Advances unless
and until such Floating Rate Advances are converted into Eurodollar Advances
pursuant to this Section 2.9 or are repaid in accordance with Section 2.7. Each
Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance until the end of the
then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurodollar Advance
shall be automatically converted into a Floating Rate Advance unless (x) such
Eurodollar Advance is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.7 or (y) the
Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation
Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period,
such Eurodollar Advance continue as a Eurodollar Advance for the same or another
Interest Period. Subject to the terms of Section 2.6, the Borrower may elect
from time to time to convert all or any part of an Advance of any Type (other
than a Swing Line Advance) into any other Type or Types of Advances; provided
that any conversion of any Eurodollar Advance shall be made on, and only on, the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 2.9, during the continuance of a Default
or an Unmatured Default, the Administrative Agent may (or shall at the direction
of the Required Lenders), by notice to the Borrower, declare that no Advance may
be made, converted or continued as a Eurodollar Advance. The Borrower shall give
the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (a "Conversion/Continuation Notice")
of each conversion of an Advance or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance not
later than 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least one (1) Business Day, in the
case of a conversion into a Floating Rate Advance, or three (3) Business Days,
in the case of a conversion into or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance, prior
to the date of the requested conversion or continuation, specifying:

         (i)      the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
                  conversion or continuation,

         (ii)     the aggregate amount and Type of the Advance which is to be
                  converted or continued, and

         (iii)    the amount of such Advance which is to be converted into or
                  continued as a Eurodollar Advance and the duration of the
                  Interest Period applicable thereto.

                                       34

         2.10. Changes in Interest Rate, Etc. Each Floating Rate Advance (other
than a Swing Line Advance) shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day from and including the date such Advance is made or
is automatically converted from a Eurodollar Advance into a Floating Rate
Advance pursuant to Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it is paid or is
converted into a Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate
per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Each Swing Line Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and
including the day such Swing Line Loan is made to but excluding the date it is
fully paid at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate for such day. Changes
in the rate of interest on that portion of any Advance maintained as a Floating
Rate Advance will take effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate
Base Rate. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period
at the interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent as applicable to
such Eurodollar Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Sections 2.8
and 2.9 and otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. No Interest Period in
respect of any Revolving Loan may end after the Revolving Loan Termination Date.
No Interest Period in respect of any Term B Loan may end after the Term Loan B
Maturity Date.

         2.11. Rates Applicable After Default. During the continuance of a
Default (including the Borrower's failure to pay any Loan at maturity) the
Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice
may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any
provision of Section 8.2 requiring unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes
in interest rates), declare that (i) each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest
for the remainder of the applicable Interest Period at the rate otherwise
applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per annum, (ii) each Floating Rate
Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Floating Rate in
effect from time to time plus 2% per annum, and (iii) the LC Fee shall be
increased by 2% per annum; provided that, during the continuance of a Default
under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
above and the increase in the LC Fee set forth in clause (iii) above shall be
applicable to all Credit Extensions, Advances, fees and other Obligations
hereunder without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender.

         2.12. Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's
address specified pursuant to Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation
of the Administrative Agent specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to
the Borrower, by 1:00 pm (New York City time) on the date when due and shall
(except with respect to repayments of Swing Line Loans, and except in the case
of Reimbursement Obligations for which any LC Issuer has not been fully
indemnified by the Lenders, or as otherwise specifically required hereunder) be
applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders. Each payment
delivered to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lender shall be
delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to such Lender in the same type
of funds that the Administrative Agent received at its address specified
pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending Installation specified in a notice
received by the Administrative Agent from such Lender. Each reference to the
Administrative Agent in this Section 2.12 shall also be deemed to refer, and
shall apply equally, to each LC Issuer in the case of payments required to be
made by the Borrower to the LC Issuers pursuant to Section 2.20.6.

                                       35

         2.13. Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.

         (i)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
                  practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
                  the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by
                  such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of
                  principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from
                  time to time hereunder.

         (ii)     The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which
                  it will record (a) the date and the amount of each Loan made
                  hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period (in the
                  case of a Eurodollar Advance) with respect thereto, (b) the
                  amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
                  become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
                  hereunder, (c) the original stated amount of each Facility LC
                  and the amount of LC Obligations outstanding at any time, (d)
                  the effective date and amount of each Assignment Agreement
                  delivered to and accepted by it and the parties thereto
                  pursuant to Section 12.3, (e) the amount of any sum received
                  by the Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower and
                  each Lender's share thereof, and (f) all other appropriate
                  debits and credits as provided in this Agreement, including,
                  without limitation, all fees, charges, expenses and interest.

         (iii)    The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to
                  paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence of
                  the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
                  provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative
                  Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error
                  therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
                  Borrower to repay the Obligations in accordance with their
                  terms.

         (iv)     Any Lender may request that its Term B Loans, Revolving Loans
                  or, in the case of the Swing Line Lender, the Swing Line
                  Loans, be evidenced by promissory notes (the "Notes") in
                  substantially the form of Exhibit E-1 or E-2 with appropriate
                  changes for notes evidencing Swing Line Loans. In such event,
                  the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender
                  such Note(s) payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter,
                  the Loans evidenced by such Note(s) and interest thereon shall
                  at all times (prior to any assignment pursuant to Section
                  12.3) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the order
                  of the payee named therein, except to the extent that any such
                  Lender subsequently returns any such Note(s) for cancellation
                  and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as
                  described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.

         2.14. Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect
selections of Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic
notices made by any person or persons the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
good faith believes to be acting on behalf of the Borrower, it being understood
that the foregoing authorization is specifically intended to allow Borrowing

                                       36
<PAGE>

Notices and Conversion/Continuation Notices to be given telephonically. The
Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to the Administrative Agent a written
confirmation, signed by an Authorized Officer, if such confirmation is requested
by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, of each telephonic notice. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, the reasonable and documented records
of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall govern absent manifest error.

         2.15. Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued
on each Floating Rate Advance shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, on any date
on which the Floating Rate Advance is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or
otherwise, and at maturity. Interest accrued on that portion of the outstanding
principal amount of any Floating Rate Advance converted into a Eurodollar
Advance on a day other than a Payment Date shall be payable on the date of
conversion. Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on the
last day of its applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar
Advance is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity.
Interest accrued on each Eurodollar Advance having an Interest Period longer
than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month
interval during such Interest Period. Interest on Eurodollar Advances, LC Fees
and all other fees hereunder shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the
basis of a 360-day year. Interest on Floating Rate Advances shall be calculated
for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year. Interest shall be
payable for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the
amount paid if payment is received prior to 1:00 pm (New York City time) at the
place of payment. If any payment of principal of or interest on an Advance, any
fees or any other amounts payable to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
hereunder shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment
shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of a
principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest, fees and commissions in connection with such payment.

         2.16. Notification of Advances, Interest Rates, Prepayments and
Revolving Loan Commitment Reductions; Availability of Loans. Promptly after
receipt thereof, the Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the
contents of each Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment reduction notice, LC
Commitment reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Swing Line Borrowing Notice,
Conversion/Continuation Notice, and repayment notice received by it hereunder.
Promptly after notice from any LC Issuer, the Administrative Agent will notify
each Lender of the contents of each request for issuance of a Facility LC
hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify the Borrower and each Lender of
the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar Advance promptly upon
determination of such interest rate and will give the Borrower and each Lender
prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Not later than 1:00
p.m. (New York City time) on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make
available its Revolving Loan or Revolving Loans in funds immediately available
in New York City to the Administrative Agent at its address specified pursuant
to Article XIII. The Administrative Agent will promptly make the funds so
received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the Administrative
Agent's aforesaid address.

         2.17. Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans and its
participation in any LC Obligations and each LC Issuer may book the Facility LCs
at any Lending Installation selected by such Lender or such LC Issuer, as

                                       37
<PAGE>

applicable, and may change its Lending Installation from time to time. All terms
of this Agreement shall apply to any such Lending Installation and the Loans,
Facility LCs, participations in LC Obligations and any Notes issued hereunder
shall be deemed held by each Lender or each LC Issuer, as applicable, for the
benefit of any such Lending Installation. Each Lender and each LC Issuer may, by
written notice to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with
Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installations through
which Loans will be made by it or Facility LCs will be issued by it and for
whose account Loan payments or payments with respect to Facility LCs are to be
made.

         2.18. Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent. Unless the
Borrower or a Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent
prior to the date on which it is scheduled to make payment to the Administrative
Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the proceeds of a Loan or (ii) in the case
of the Borrower, a payment of principal, interest or fees to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders, that it does not intend to make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such payment has been made.
The Administrative Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make the amount of
such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon such
assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in fact
made such payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient of such payment
shall, on demand by the Administrative Agent, repay to the Administrative Agent
the amount so made available together with interest thereon in respect of each
day during the period commencing on the date such amount was so made available
by the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers
such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment by a Lender,
the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three days and,
thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y) in the case
of payment by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan.

         2.19. Replacement of Lender. If the Borrower is required pursuant to
Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
Lender's obligation to make or continue, or to convert Floating Rate Advances
into, Eurodollar Advances shall be suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 or if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender (any Lender so affected an "Affected
Lender"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to be charged or such
suspension is still effective, to terminate or replace the Revolving Loan
Commitment, Term Loan B Commitment and Loans of such Affected Lender, provided
that no Default or Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at
the time of such termination or replacement, and provided further that,
concurrently with such termination or replacement, (i) if the Affected Lender is
being replaced, another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to
purchase for cash the Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure and Term B Loans of
the Affected Lender pursuant to an Assignment Agreement substantially in the
form of Exhibit C and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement
and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be terminated as of such
date and to comply with the requirements of Section 12.3 applicable to
assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Affected Lender in
immediately available funds on the day of such replacement (A) all interest,
fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Affected Lender by the
Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without
limitation payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5,
and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to
such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had the Loans of
such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the

                                       38
<PAGE>

replacement Lender, in each case to the extent not paid by the purchasing lender
and (iii) if the Affected Lender is being terminated, the Borrower shall pay to
such Affected Lender all Obligations due to such Affected Lender (including the
amounts described in the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) plus, to the
extent not paid by the replacement Lender, the outstanding principal balance of
such Affected Lender's Credit Extensions).

         2.20. Facility LCs.

                  2.20.1 Existing Letters of Credit; Issuance. The Borrower, the
         Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Initial LC Issuers agree and
         confirm that, as of the Closing Date, and subject to the satisfaction
         of the condition precedent set forth in Section 4.1, the Existing
         Letters of Credit shall (x) be deemed to have been issued pursuant to
         this Agreement, (y) constitute Facility LCs, and (z) be governed by
         this Section 2.20, together with the other terms and conditions of this
         Agreement. Each LC Issuer hereby agrees, on the terms and conditions
         set forth in this Agreement, to issue, or cause to be issued, standby
         and commercial Letters of Credit (each, a "Facility LC") and to renew,
         extend, increase, decrease or otherwise modify each Facility LC
         ("Modify," and each such action, a "Modification"), from time to time
         from and including the date of this Agreement and prior to the
         Revolving Loan Termination Date upon the request of the Borrower;
         provided that, immediately after each such Facility LC is issued or
         Modified, the Aggregate Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure shall not
         exceed the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment and the aggregate amount
         of the LC Obligations shall not exceed the LC Sublimit. No Facility LC
         shall have an expiry date later than the earlier of (x) the fifth
         Business Day prior to the Revolving Loan Termination Date and (y) one
         year after its issuance; provided that any Facility LC with a one-year
         term may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year
         periods (which in no event shall extend beyond the date referred to in
         the preceding clause (x)). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
         else contained in the Loan Documents, Bank One shall have no obligation
         whatsoever to issue or renew any Letters of Credit other than the
         deemed issuance of the Existing Letters of Credit.

                  2.20.2 Participations. Upon the issuance or Modification by
         any LC Issuer of a Facility LC in accordance with this Section 2.20,
         such LC Issuer shall be deemed, without further action by any party
         hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably sold to each Lender,
         and each Lender shall be deemed, without further action by any party
         hereto, to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from such LC
         Issuer, a participation in such Facility LC (and each Modification
         thereof) and the related LC Obligations in proportion to its Revolving
         Loan Pro Rata Share.

                  2.20.3 Notice. Subject to Section 2.20.1, the Borrower shall
         give any LC Issuer notice prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at
         least five Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance or
         Modification of each Facility LC, specifying the beneficiary, the
         proposed date of issuance (or Modification) and the expiry date of such
         Facility LC, and describing the proposed terms of such Facility LC and
         the nature of the transactions proposed to be supported thereby. Upon
         receipt of such notice, such LC Issuer shall promptly notify the

                                       39
<PAGE>

         Administrative Agent, and, upon issuance only, the Administrative Agent
         shall promptly notify each Lender, of the contents thereof and of the
         amount of such Lender's participation in such proposed Facility LC. The
         issuance or Modification by any LC Issuer of any Facility LC shall, in
         addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Article IV (the
         satisfaction of which such LC Issuer shall have no duty to ascertain),
         be subject to the conditions precedent that such Facility LC shall be
         satisfactory to such LC Issuer and that the Borrower shall have
         executed and delivered such application agreement and/or such other
         instruments and agreements relating to such Facility LC as such LC
         Issuer shall have reasonably requested (each, a "Facility LC
         Application"). In the event of any conflict between the terms of this
         Agreement and the terms of any Facility LC Application, the terms of
         this Agreement shall control.

                  2.20.4 LC Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
         Agent, for the account of the Lenders ratably in accordance with their
         respective Revolving Loan Pro Rata Shares, a letter of credit fee at a
         per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans in
         effect from time to time on the average daily undrawn stated amount
         under such Facility LC, such fee to be payable in arrears on each
         Payment Date. The Borrower shall also pay to each LC Issuer for its own
         account (x) at the time of issuance of each Facility LC which is a
         standby letter of credit, a fronting fee in an amount equal to 0.25%
         times the face amount of such Facility LC and (y) documentary and
         processing charges in connection with the issuance or Modification of
         and draws under Facility LCs in accordance with such LC Issuer's
         standard schedule for such charges as in effect from time to time. Each
         fee described in this Section 2.20.4 shall constitute an "LC Fee".

                  2.20.5 Administration; Reimbursement by Lenders. Upon receipt
         from the beneficiary of any Facility LC of any demand for payment under
         such Facility LC, each LC Issuer shall notify the Administrative Agent
         and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
         each other Lender as to the amount to be paid by such LC Issuer as a
         result of such demand and the proposed payment date (the "LC Payment
         Date"). The responsibility of each LC Issuer to the Borrower and each
         Lender shall be only to determine that the documents (including each
         demand for payment) delivered under each Facility LC in connection with
         such presentment shall be in conformity in all material respects with
         such Facility LC. Each LC Issuer shall endeavor to exercise the same
         care in the issuance and administration of the Facility LCs as it does
         with respect to letters of credit in which no participations are
         granted, it being understood that in the absence of any gross
         negligence or willful misconduct by such LC Issuer, each Lender shall
         be unconditionally and irrevocably liable without regard to the
         occurrence of any Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, to
         reimburse such LC Issuer on demand for (i) such Lender's Revolving Loan
         Pro Rata Share of the amount of each payment made by such LC Issuer
         under each Facility LC to the extent such amount is not reimbursed by
         the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.20.6 below, plus (ii) interest on
         the foregoing amount to be reimbursed by such Lender, for each day from
         the date of such LC Issuer's demand for such reimbursement (or, if such
         demand is made after 2:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such date, from
         the next succeeding Business Day) to the date on which such Lender pays
         the amount to be reimbursed by it, at a rate of interest per annum
         equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first three days and,
         thereafter, at a rate of interest equal to the rate applicable to
         Floating Rate Advances.

                                       40

                  2.20.6 Reimbursement by Borrower. The Borrower shall be
         irrevocably and unconditionally obligated to reimburse such LC Issuer
         on or before the applicable LC Payment Date for any amounts to be paid
         by such LC Issuer upon any drawing under any Facility LC, without
         presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind; provided
         that neither the Borrower nor any Lender shall hereby be precluded from
         asserting any claim for direct (but not consequential) damages suffered
         by the Borrower or such Lender to the extent, but only to the extent,
         caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such LC
         Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC
         issued by it complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (ii) such
         LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC issued by it after the
         presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
         conditions of such Facility LC. If the Borrower at any time fails to
         repay a Reimbursement Obligation pursuant to this Section 2.20, such
         unpaid Reimbursement Obligation shall at that time be automatically
         converted into an obligation and the Borrower shall be deemed to have
         elected to borrow a Revolving Loan from the Lenders, as of the date of
         the payment by the applicable LC Issuer giving rise to the
         Reimbursement Obligation equal in amount to the amount of the unpaid
         Reimbursement Obligation. Such Revolving Loan shall be made as of the
         date of the payment giving rise to such Reimbursement Obligation,
         automatically, without notice and without any requirement to satisfy
         the conditions precedent otherwise applicable to a Revolving Loan if
         the Borrower shall have failed to make such payment to the
         Administrative Agent for the account of such LC Issuer prior to such
         time. Such Revolving Loan shall constitute a Floating Rate Advance and
         the proceeds of such Advance shall be used to repay such Reimbursement
         Obligation. If, for any reason, the Borrower fails to repay a
         Reimbursement Obligation on the day such Reimbursement Obligation
         arises and, for any reason, the Lenders are unable to make or have no
         obligation to make a Revolving Loan, then such Reimbursement Obligation
         shall bear interest from and after such day, until paid in full, at the
         interest rate applicable to a Floating Rate Advance. The Borrower
         agrees to indemnify each LC Issuer against any loss or expense
         determined by such LC Issuer in good faith to have resulted from any
         conversion pursuant to this Section 2.20 by reason of the inability of
         such LC Issuer to convert the amount received from the Borrower or from
         the Lenders, as applicable, into an amount equal to the amount of such
         Reimbursement Obligation. Each LC Issuer will pay to each Lender
         ratably in accordance with its Revolving Loan Pro Rata Share all
         amounts received by it from the Borrower for application in payment, in
         whole or in part, of the Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any
         Facility LC issued by such LC Issuer, but only to the extent such
         Lender has made payment to such LC Issuer in respect of such Facility
         LC pursuant to Section 2.20.5.

                  2.20.7 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligations under
         this Section 2.20 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all
         circumstances and irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense
         to payment which the Borrower may have or have had against any LC
         Issuer, any Lender or any beneficiary of a Facility LC. The Borrower
         further agrees with the LC Issuers and the Lenders that the LC Issuers
         and the Lenders shall not be responsible for, and the Borrower's
         Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Facility LC shall not be

                                       41
<PAGE>

         affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of
         documents or of any endorsements thereon, even if such documents should
         in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent or
         forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower, any of its
         Affiliates, the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any financing
         institution or other party to whom any Facility LC may be transferred
         or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower or of any of its
         Affiliates against the beneficiary of any Facility LC or any such
         transferee. The LC Issuers shall not be liable for any error, omission,
         interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any
         message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with any Facility
         LC. The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by any LC
         Issuer or any Lender under or in connection with each Facility LC and
         the related drafts and documents, if done without gross negligence or
         willful misconduct, shall be binding upon the Borrower and shall not
         put any LC Issuer or any Lender under any liability to the Borrower.
         Nothing in this Section 2.20.7 is intended to limit the right of the
         Borrower to make a claim against any LC Issuer for damages as
         contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.20.6.

                  2.20.8 Actions of LC Issuers. Each LC Issuer shall be entitled
         to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any Facility LC,
         draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
         letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
         statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and
         correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
         Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent
         accountants and other experts selected by such LC Issuer. Each LC
         Issuer shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
         action under this Agreement unless it shall first have received such
         advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it reasonably deems
         appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable
         satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense
         which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take
         any such action. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
         2.20, each LC Issuer shall in all cases be fully protected in acting,
         or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a
         request of the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken
         or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Lenders
         and any future holders of a participation in any Facility LC.

                  2.20.9 Indemnification. The Borrower hereby agrees to
         indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, each LC Issuer and the
         Administrative Agent, and their respective directors, officers, agents
         and employees from and against any and all claims and damages, losses,
         liabilities, costs or expenses which such Lender, such LC Issuer or the
         Administrative Agent may incur (or which may be claimed against such
         Lender, such LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent by any Person
         whatsoever) by reason of or in connection with the issuance, execution
         and delivery or transfer of or payment or failure to pay under any
         Facility LC or any actual or proposed use of any Facility LC,
         including, without limitation, any claims, damages, losses,
         liabilities, costs or expenses which such LC Issuer may incur by reason
         of or in connection with (i) the failure of any other Lender to fulfill
         or comply with its obligations to such LC Issuer hereunder (but nothing
         herein contained shall affect any rights the Borrower may have against
         any defaulting Lender) or (ii) by reason of or on account of such LC
         Issuer issuing any Facility LC which specifies that the term
         "Beneficiary" included therein includes any successor by operation of
         law of the named Beneficiary, but which Facility LC does not require
         that any drawing by any such successor Beneficiary be accompanied by a
         copy of a legal document, satisfactory to such LC Issuer, evidencing
         the appointment of such successor Beneficiary; provided that the

                                       42
<PAGE>

         Borrower shall not be required to indemnify any Lender, any LC Issuer
         or the Administrative Agent for any claims, damages, losses,
         liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent,
         caused by (x) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of any LC
         Issuer in determining whether a request presented under any Facility LC
         complied with the terms of such Facility LC or (y) any LC Issuer's
         failure to pay under any Facility LC after the presentation to it of a
         request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such
         Facility LC. Nothing in this Section 2.20.9 is intended to limit the
         obligations of the Borrower under any other provision of this
         Agreement.

                  2.20.10 Lenders' Indemnification. Each Lender shall, ratably
         in accordance with its Revolving Loan Pro Rata Share, indemnify each LC
         Issuer, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents
         and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower) against
         any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and
         disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such
         as result from such indemnitees' gross negligence or willful misconduct
         or such LC Issuer's failure to pay under any Facility LC after the
         presentation to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and
         conditions of the Facility LC) that such indemnitees may suffer or
         incur in connection with this Section 2.20 or any action taken or
         omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.

                  2.20.11 Facility LC Collateral Account. The Borrower agrees
         that it will, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the
         Required Lenders and until the final expiration date of any Facility LC
         and thereafter as long as any amount is payable to any LC Issuer or the
         Lenders in respect of any Facility LC, maintain the Facility LC
         Collateral Account. The Borrower hereby pledges, assigns and grants to
         the Administrative Agent, on behalf of and for the ratable benefit of
         the Lenders and the LC Issuers, a security interest in all of the
         Borrower's right, title and interest in and to all funds which may from
         time to time be on deposit in the Facility LC Collateral Account to
         secure the prompt and complete payment and performance of the Secured
         Obligations. The Administrative Agent will invest any funds on deposit
         from time to time in the Facility LC Collateral Account in Cash
         Equivalent Investments having a maturity not exceeding 30 days. Nothing
         in this Section 2.20.11 shall (i) require the Borrower or any
         Subsidiary to either establish the Facility LC Collateral Account or
         deposit any funds in the Facility LC Collateral Account or (ii) limit
         the right of the Administrative Agent to release any funds held in the
         Facility LC Collateral Account, in each case other than as required by
         Section 2.2 or Section 8.1.

                  2.20.12 Rights as a Lender. In its capacity as a Lender, if
         any, each LC Issuer shall have the same rights and obligations as any
         other Lender.

         2.21. Defaulting Lenders. (a) In the event that, at any one time, (i)
any Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a
Defaulted Loan to the Borrower and (iii) the Borrower shall be required to make
any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of
such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, so long as no Default shall occur
or be continuing at such time and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, set off and otherwise apply the Obligation of the Borrower to make such

                                       43
<PAGE>

payment to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender against the obligation
of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted Loan. In the event that, on any
date, the Borrower shall so set off and otherwise apply its obligation to make
any such payment against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make any
such Defaulted Loan on or prior to such date, the amount so set off and
otherwise applied by the Borrower shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents a Loan by such Defaulting Lender made on
the date of such setoff under the Facility pursuant to which such Defaulted Loan
was originally required to have been made pursuant to Section 2.1. Such Loan
shall be considered, for all purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the
Advance in connection with which such Defaulted Loan was originally required to
have been made pursuant to Section 2.1, even if the other Loans comprising such
Advance shall be Eurodollar Loans on the date such Loan is deemed to be made
pursuant to this subsection (a). The Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent at any time the Borrower exercises its right of set-off pursuant to this
subsection (a) and shall set forth in such notice (A) the name of the Defaulting
Lender and the Defaulted Loan required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and
(B) the amount set off and otherwise applied in respect of such Defaulted Loan
pursuant to this subsection (a). Any portion of such payment otherwise required
to be made by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender which
is paid by the Borrower, after giving effect to the amount set off and otherwise
applied by the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.21.

         (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount to
any Agent or any of the other Lenders and (iii) the Borrower shall make any
payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Administrative Agent may, on
its behalf or on behalf of such other Agents or such other Lenders and to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply at such time the amount so
paid by the Borrower to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender to the
payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the extent required to pay such
Defaulted Amount. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall so apply any
such amount to the payment of any such Defaulted Amount on any date, the amount
so applied by the Administrative Agent shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents payment, to such extent, of such
Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount so applied by the Administrative
Agent shall be retained by the Administrative Agent or distributed by the
Administrative Agent to such other Agents or such other Lenders, ratably in
accordance with the respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at
such time to the Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lenders
and, if the amount of such payment made by the Borrower shall at such time be
insufficient to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the
Administrative Agent, such other Agents and such other Lenders, in the following
order of priority:

         (i)      first, to the Agents for any Defaulted Amounts then owing to
                  them, in their capacities as such, ratably in accordance with
                  such respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to the Agents;

         (ii)     second, to the LC Issuers and the Swing Line Lender for any
                  Defaulted Amounts then owing to them, in their capacities as
                  such, ratably in accordance with such respective Defaulted
                  Amounts then owing to each LC Issuer and the Swing Line
                  Lender; and

                                       44
<PAGE>

         (iii)    third, to any other Lenders for any Defaulted Amounts then
                  owing to such other Lenders, ratably in accordance with such
                  respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lenders.

         Any portion of such amount paid by the Borrower for the account of such
         Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied
         by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be
         applied by the Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of
         this Section 2.21.

         (c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a Defaulted Loan or
a Defaulted Amount and (iii) the Borrower, any Agent or any other Lender shall
be required to pay or distribute any amount hereunder or under any other Loan
Document to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower or
such Agent or such other Lender shall pay such amount to the Administrative
Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, in escrow or the Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow such amount otherwise held by
it. Any funds held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under this subsection
(c) shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent in an account with a bank
(the "Escrow Bank") selected by the Administrative Agent, in the name and under
the control of the Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this
subsection (c). The terms applicable to such account, including the rate of
interest payable with respect to the credit balance of such account from time to
time, shall be the Escrow Bank's standard terms applicable to escrow accounts
maintained with it. Any interest credited to such account from time to time
shall be held by the Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by the
Administrative Agent from time to time in accordance with the provisions of,
this subsection (c). The Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time
to the extent necessary to make any Loans required to be made by such Defaulting
Lender and to pay any amount payable by such Defaulting Lender hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender,
as and when such Loans or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the
amount so held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all
such Loans and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, in the
following order of priority:

         (i)      first, to the Agents for any amounts then due and payable by
                  such Defaulting Lender to them hereunder, in their capacities
                  as such, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts
                  then due and payable to the Agents;

         (ii)     second, to the LC Issuers and the Swing Line Lender for any
                  amounts then due and payable to them hereunder, in their
                  capacities as such, by such Defaulting Lender, ratably in
                  accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable
                  to each LC Issuer and the Swing Line Lender;

         (iii)    third, to any other Lenders for any amount then due and
                  payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lenders
                  hereunder, ratably in accordance with such respective amounts
                  then due and payable to such other Lenders; and

                                       45
<PAGE>

         (iv)     fourth, to the Borrower for any Loan then required to be made
                  by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Revolving Loan
                  Commitment, Swing Line Commitment, Term Loan B Commitment or
                  LC Commitment of such Defaulting Lender.

                  In the event that any Lender that is a Defaulting Lender
                  shall, at any time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds
                  held by the Administrative Agent in escrow at such time with
                  respect to such Lender shall be distributed by the
                  Administrative Agent to such Lender and applied by such Lender
                  to the Obligations owing to such Lender at such time under
                  this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in
                  accordance with the respective amounts of such Obligations
                  outstanding at such time.

         (d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this
Section 2.21 are in addition to other rights and remedies that the Borrower may
have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Loan and that
any Agent or any Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to
any Defaulted Amount.

                                  ARTICLE III
                             YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

         3.1. Yield Protection. If, on or after the Closing Date, the adoption
of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy,
guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of law), or any change
in any such law, rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental or
quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or
applicable Lending Installation or any LC Issuer with any request or directive
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of
Reserve Requirements):

         (i)      subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation or
                  any LC Issuer to any Taxes, or changes the basis of taxation
                  of payments (other than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any
                  Lender or any LC Issuer in respect of its Revolving Loan
                  Commitments, LC Commitments, Eurodollar Loans, Facility LCs or
                  participations therein, or

         (ii)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
                  assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar
                  requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
                  account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any
                  applicable Lending Installation or any LC Issuer (other than
                  reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the
                  interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

         (iii)    imposes any other condition the result of which is to increase
                  the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
                  of making, funding or maintaining its Revolving Loan

                                       46
<PAGE>

                  Commitment or Eurodollar Loans or its LC Commitment or of
                  issuing or participating in Facility LCs, or reduces any
                  amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending
                  Installation or any LC Issuer in connection with its Revolving
                  Loan Commitment, LC Commitment or Eurodollar Loans or Facility
                  LCs (including participations therein), or requires any Lender
                  or any applicable Lending Installation or any LC Issuer to
                  make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of
                  Revolving Loan Commitment, LC Commitment or Eurodollar Loans
                  or Facility LCs (including participations therein) held or
                  interest or LC Fees received by it, by an amount deemed
                  material by such Lender or such LC Issuer, as applicable.

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation or such LC Issuer of making or maintaining its
Eurodollar Loans or Revolving Loan Commitment or LC Commitment or of issuing or
participating in Facility LCs, as applicable, or to reduce the return received
by such Lender or applicable Lending Installation or such LC Issuer in
connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Revolving Loan Commitment, LC
Commitment or Facility LCs (including participations therein), then, within 15
days of demand, accompanied by the written statement required by Section 3.6, by
such Lender or such LC Issuer, the Borrower shall pay such Lender or such LC
Issuer such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
LC Issuer for such increased cost or reduction in amount received. If, upon
receipt of the notice specified by the immediately preceding sentence, the
Borrower so notifies the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may either (i)
prepay in full all Eurodollar Loans of such Lender then outstanding, so long as
the Borrower reimburses such Lender for its increased costs in accordance with
this Section 3.1, or (ii) convert all Eurodollar Loans of all Lenders then
outstanding into Floating Rate Loans in accordance with this Agreement, so long
as the Borrower reimburses the Lenders for all of their increased costs in
accordance with this Section 3.1.

         3.2. Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender or LC Issuer
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender or LC Issuer, any Lending Installation of such Lender or LC Issuer or any
corporation controlling such Lender or LC Issuer is increased as a result of a
Change, then, within 15 days of demand, accompanied by the written statement
required by Section 3.6, by such Lender or LC Issuer, the Borrower shall pay
such Lender or LC Issuer the amount necessary to compensate for any shortfall in
the rate of return on the portion of such increased capital which such Lender or
LC Issuer determines is attributable to this Agreement, its Outstanding
Revolving Credit Exposure, its Term B Loans, its Term B Loan Commitment to make
Term B Loans, its Revolving Loan Commitment or LC Commitment to make Revolving
Loans and issue or participate in Facility LCs, as applicable, hereunder (after
taking into account such Lender's or LC Issuer's policies as to capital
adequacy). "Change" means (i) any change after the Closing Date in the
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines or (ii) any adoption of, or change in, or change
in the interpretation or administration of any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the Closing Date which
affects the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by any
Lender or LC Issuer or any Lending Installation or any corporation controlling
any Lender or LC Issuer. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the
risk-based capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the Closing
Date, including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations

                                       47
<PAGE>

promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the Closing Date.

         3.3. Availability of Types of Advances. (a) Eurodollar Advances shall
not be available on the Closing Date. For 45 days following the Closing Date no
Eurodollar Advances shall be available other than those with an Interest Period
of one month.

         (b) If (x) any Lender reasonably determines that maintenance of its
Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation would violate any applicable
law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not having the force of law, or
(y) the Required Lenders determine in good faith that (i) deposits of a type and
maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances are not available or (ii)
the interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances does not accurately reflect
the cost of making or maintaining Eurodollar Advances, or (iii) no reasonable
basis exists for determining the Eurodollar Base Rate, then the Administrative
Agent shall suspend the availability of Eurodollar Advances and require any
affected Eurodollar Advances to be repaid or converted to Floating Rate Advances
on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Revolving Loans or within such earlier period as required by law, subject
to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4.

         3.4. Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar Advance
occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a Eurodollar
Advance is not made or continued, or a Floating Rate Advance is not converted
into a Eurodollar Advance, on the date specified by the Borrower for any reason
other than default by the Lenders, or a Eurodollar Advance is not prepaid on the
date specified by the Borrower for any reason, the Borrower will indemnify each
Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom, including,
without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing deposits
acquired to fund or maintain such Eurodollar Advance.

         3.5. Taxes.

         (i)      All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of any
                  Lender or any LC Issuer or the Administrative Agent hereunder
                  or under any Note shall be made free and clear of and without
                  deduction for any and all Taxes. If the Borrower shall be
                  required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
                  sum payable hereunder to any Lender, LC Issuer or the
                  Administrative Agent, (a) the sum payable shall be increased
                  as necessary so that after making all required deductions
                  (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
                  under this Section 3.5) such Lender, LC Issuer or the
                  Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount
                  equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
                  been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (c)
                  the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
                  relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d)
                  the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent the
                  original copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof or, if a
                  receipt cannot be obtained with reasonable efforts, such other
                  evidence of payment as is reasonably acceptable to the
                  Administrative Agent, in each case within 30 days after such
                  payment is made.

                                       48
<PAGE>

         (ii)     In addition, the Borrower shall pay any present or future
                  stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property
                  taxes, intangible or mortgage recording taxes, charges or
                  similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or
                  under any Note or Facility LC Application or from the
                  execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this
                  Agreement or any Note or Facility LC Application ("Other
                  Taxes").

         (iii)    The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each LC
                  Issuer and each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other
                  Taxes (including, without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes
                  imposed on amounts payable under this Section 3.5) paid by the
                  Administrative Agent, such LC Issuer or such Lender as a
                  result of its Revolving Loan Commitment or LC Commitment, any
                  Credit Extensions made by it hereunder, any Facility LC issued
                  or participated in by it hereunder, or otherwise in connection
                  with its participation in this Agreement and any liability
                  (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
                  or with respect thereto. Payments due under this
                  indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the
                  Administrative Agent, such LC Issuer or such Lender makes
                  demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

         (iv)     Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the
                  United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S.
                  Lender") agrees that it will, not more than ten Business Days
                  after the date on which it becomes a party to this Agreement
                  (but in any event before a payment is due to it hereunder),
                  (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the Administrative
                  Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal
                  Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, certifying in either
                  case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
                  this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
                  States federal income taxes, or (ii) in the case of a Non-U.S.
                  Lender that is fiscally transparent, deliver to the
                  Administrative Agent a United States Internal Revenue Form
                  W-8IMY together with the applicable accompanying forms, W-8 or
                  W-9, as the case may be, and certify that it is entitled to an
                  exemption from United States backup withholding tax. Each
                  Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of the
                  Borrower and the Administrative Agent (x) renewals or
                  additional copies of such form (or any successor form) on or
                  before the date that such form expires or becomes obsolete,
                  and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring a change
                  in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional
                  forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by
                  the Borrower or the Administrative Agent. All forms or
                  amendments described in the preceding sentence shall certify
                  that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
                  Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
                  States federal income taxes, unless an event (including
                  without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation)
                  has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery
                  would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
                  inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly
                  completing and delivering any such form or amendment with
                  respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower and the
                  Administrative Agent that it is not capable of receiving
                  payments without any deduction or withholding of United States
                  federal income tax.

                                       49
<PAGE>

         (v)      For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to
                  provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to
                  clause (iv) above (unless such failure is due to a change in
                  treaty, law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation
                  or administration thereof by any governmental authority,
                  occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally
                  was required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not
                  be entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.5 with
                  respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided that,
                  should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or
                  subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax become subject to
                  Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required under
                  clause (iv) above, the Borrower shall take such steps as such
                  Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
                  Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

         (vi)     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction
                  of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
                  Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant
                  jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with
                  a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
                  prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and
                  executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will
                  permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
                  reduced rate.

         (vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental
                  authority of the United States or any other country or any
                  political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the
                  Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from
                  amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
                  appropriate form was not delivered or properly completed,
                  because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent
                  of a change in circumstances which rendered its exemption from
                  withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender
                  shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts
                  paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as
                  tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties
                  and interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction
                  on amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this
                  subsection, together with all costs and expenses related
                  thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of
                  attorneys for the Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be
                  employees of the Administrative Agent). The obligations of the
                  Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii) shall survive the payment
                  of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.6. Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity. Each Lender shall
deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in reasonable detail the
calculations upon which such Lender determined such amount and shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.
Determination of amounts payable under such Sections in connection with a
Eurodollar Loan shall be calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar
Loan through the purchase of a deposit of the type, currency and maturity
corresponding to the deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar
Rate applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.

                                       50

Notwithstanding any other term or condition contained herein or elsewhere in the
Loan Documents, a Lender claiming compensation under Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or
3.5 shall only be entitled to compensation under this Article III (i) from and
after the date of such notice until the events giving rise to such claim have
ceased to exist, and (ii) during the ninety (90) day period preceding the date
the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or such Lender
setting forth the described claim for compensation. Unless otherwise provided
herein, the amount specified in the written statement of any Lender shall be
payable on demand after receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The
obligations of the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         3.7. Alternative Lending Installation. To the extent reasonably
possible, each Lender shall designate an alternate Lending Installation with
respect to its Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such
Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of
Eurodollar Advances under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not, in
the judgment of such Lender, reasonably disadvantageous to such Lender. A
Lender's designation of an alternative Lending Installation shall not affect the
Borrower's rights under Section 2.19 to replace a Lender.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

the Administrative Agent with sufficient copies for the Lenders:

         otherwise necessary for the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
         verify the identity of such Credit Party as required by Section 326 of
         the USA Patriot Act, 31 U.S.C. Section 5318.

                  4.1.2 Copies, certified by the Secretary or Assistant
         Secretary (or the equivalent thereof) of each initial Credit Party, in

         execution of the Loan Documents and Tapco Acquisition Documents to
         which such Credit Party is a party and certified copies of the Tapco
         Acquisition Documents.

                  4.1.3 An incumbency certificate, executed by the Secretary or

         and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely until informed of any change
         in writing by such Credit Party.

         assumptions made in such Pro Forma Opening Statements and Projections,
         such Pro Forma Opening Statements and Projections demonstrating, in the
         reasonable judgment of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
         together with all other information then available to the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders, that the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries have the ability to repay their debts and satisfy the

         be left with unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its
         businesses.

                  4.1.12 The Administrative Agent shall have received evidence
         reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent of (i) the
         consummation of the Tapco Acquisition concurrently with the initial
         Credit Extension strictly in accordance with the terms of the Tapco

         and in compliance with all applicable laws and (ii) the payment of all
         principal, interest, fees and premiums, if any, on all (x) Indebtedness
         under the Existing Credit Agreement and (y) Indebtedness of Tapco, and,
         in each case, the agreement to release all Liens and the termination of
         the applicable agreements relating thereto, all taking effect
         concurrently with the effectiveness of this Agreement; provided,
         however, that any Existing Letters of Credit incorporated into and
         governed by the terms of this Agreement shall not be required to be
         terminated in connection with the termination of the Existing Credit
         Agreement and the agreements, documents, and instruments related
         thereto.

                  4.1.13 Such other documents as the Administrative Agent or its
         counsel may have reasonably requested, including, without limitation,
         those documents set forth in Exhibit G hereto.

                  4.1.14 The Lenders shall have completed a legal,
         environmental, tax, accounting and confirmatory business due diligence
         investigation of the Credit Parties and their respective Subsidiaries
         in scope, and with results, satisfactory to the Lenders.

                  4.1.15 The Lenders shall have received true and complete

         Subsidiaries, including the terms and conditions of the charter, bylaws
         and each class of Equity Interest in each Credit Party and each
         Subsidiary and of each agreement or instrument relating to such
         structure or capitalization.

         respect thereto and the Borrower shall have received at least $150

         fund the Transaction and (b) the full amount of the Revolving Credit
         Commitments (minus any amount attributable to the Existing Letters of
         Credit) shall be available to be drawn under the Revolving Credit
         Facility after giving effect to all drawings on the Closing Date.

                  4.1.18 The Lead Arrangers shall be satisfied with the
         Borrower's arrangements to retain and compensate key employees of Tapco

         a certificate from the Chief Financial Officer of the Borrower
         certifying (based on stated assumptions as to the EBITDA of Tapco and
         its Subsidiaries), that (a) Consolidated EBITDA for the 12-month period
         ending as of the most recently ended fiscal quarter on a pro forma

         Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers and the Lenders (including the
         fees and expenses of counsel for the Lead Arrangers and local counsel
         for the Lenders).

                  4.1.21 The credit facilities contemplated by the terms of this
         Agreement shall have received debt ratings from Moody's Investor
         Services, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of
         the McGraw Hill Companies, Inc.

         4.2. Each Credit Extension. The Lenders shall not (except as otherwise
set forth in Section 2.4.4 with respect to Revolving Loans extended for the
purpose of repaying Swing Line Loans) be required to make any Credit Extension
unless on the applicable Credit Extension Date:

                  4.2.1 There exists no Default or Unmatured Default and no
         Default or Unmatured Default would result from such Credit Extension or
         issuance or renewal of from the application of proceeds therefrom.

                  4.2.2 The representations and warranties contained in Article
         V are true and correct in all material respects as of such Credit
         Extension Date before and after giving effect to such Credit Extension
         or issuance or renewal and to the application of proceeds therefrom
         except to the extent any such representation or warranty is stated to
         relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such representation or
         warranty shall have been true and correct on and as of such earlier
         date.

be, or request for issuance of a Facility LC, with respect to each such Credit
Extension shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that
the conditions contained in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 have been satisfied. The
Administrative Agent may require a duly completed compliance certificate in
substantially the form of Exhibit B as a condition to making a Credit Extension.

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender and the
Administrative Agent as of each of (i) the Closing Date, (ii) the date of the
initial Credit Extension hereunder (if different from the Closing Date) and
(iii) each date as required by Section 4.2:

         5.1. Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or limited
liability company (in the case of Subsidiaries only) duly and properly
incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing and (to the
extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite
authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is
conducted, except where the failure to do so could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.2. Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and
authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder. The execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and
the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by
proper proceedings, and the Transaction Documents to which the Borrower is a
party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyances, reorganization or similar laws relating to or affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally; (ii) general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law); and (iii) requirements
of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

         5.3. No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, of the Loan
Documents to which such Person is a party, nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof,
nor the consummation of the Tapco Acquisition or the Refinancing will violate
(i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or
award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) the Borrower's
or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of incorporation, partnership
agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or certificate of organization,
by-laws, or operating agreement or other management agreement, as the case may
be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture, instrument or agreement to which
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject, or by which
it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with, or constitute a default
thereunder, or result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in,
of or on the Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of,
any such indenture, instrument or agreement, except as in the aggregate could
not be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Change. No order,
consent, adjudication, approval, license, authorization, or validation of, or
filing, recording or registration with, or exemption by, or other action in
respect of any governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision
thereof, which has not been obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
is required to be obtained by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in

                                       55
<PAGE>

connection with the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings
under this Agreement, the payment and performance by the Borrower of the
Obligations or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
of the Loan Documents, or the consummation of the Tapco Acquisition or the
Refinancing except as in the aggregate cannot reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.4. Financial Statements. (a) The September 30, 2003 audited
consolidated financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and the
October 31, 2003 audited consolidated financial statements of Tapco Holdings,
Inc. and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in effect on the date such statements were prepared and fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial condition and
operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries, respectively, at such date and the consolidated results of their
operations for the period then ended. The June 30, 2004 unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Tapco Holdings,
Inc. and its Subsidiaries, respectively, heretofore delivered to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders, were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in effect on the date such statements were
prepared and fairly present, subject to year-end audit adjustments, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial condition and operations of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such date and the consolidated results of
their operations for the period then ended.

                  (b) The consolidated pro forma balance sheet of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries as at June 30, 2004 and the related Consolidated pro forma
statements of income and cash flows of the Borrower for the twelve months then
ended, certified by the chief financial officer of the Borrower, copies of which
have been furnished to each Lender Party, fairly present, subject to year-end
audit adjustments, in all material respects the consolidated pro forma financial
condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as at such date and the
Consolidated pro forma results of operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries for the period ended on such date, in each case giving effect to
the Tapco Acquisition, all in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

         5.5. Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 2003, there has been
no Material Adverse Change and since October 31, 2003, there has been no
material adverse change in the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
operations, performance and properties of Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

         5.6. Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States federal tax returns, Utah state tax returns and, to the Borrower's best
knowledge after due inquiry, all other tax returns which are required to be
filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any
assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except in
respect of such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith and as to
which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists (except as permitted by
Section 6.15.1), except as could not be reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change. No Liens have been filed and no claims are being
asserted with respect to such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the
books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other
governmental charges are adequate under Agreement Accounting Principles.

                                       56
<PAGE>

         5.7. Litigation and Contingent Obligations. There is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their officers, threatened against or affecting the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Change or affecting Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations,
performance or properties of Tapco Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole, or which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of any Credit
Extensions. Other than liabilities incident to any litigation, arbitration or
proceeding which could not reasonably be expected to be in an aggregate amount
in excess of $1,000,000 or as disclosed in Schedule 5.7, the Borrower has no
material contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial
statements referred to in Section 5.4.

         5.8. Subsidiaries. Schedule 5.8 contains an accurate list of all
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and are owned by such Credit
Party or one or more of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all Liens, except
those created under the Collateral Documents and the second priority liens
created under the Second Lien Collateral Documents.

         5.9. ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans do
not in the aggregate exceed $1,000,000. Neither the Borrower nor any other
member of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur,
pursuant to Section 4201 of ERISA, any withdrawal liability to Multiemployer
Plans an amount that would result in a Material Adverse Change. Each Plan
complies in all material respects with all applicable requirements of law and
regulations. No Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan. Neither
the Borrower nor any other member of the Controlled Group has withdrawn from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan within the meaning of Title IV of
ERISA or initiated steps to do so, and no steps have been taken to reorganize or
terminate, within the meaning of Title IV of ERISA, any Multiemployer Plan. No
steps have been taken to initiate the termination of any Plan, and the PBGC has
not given notice that it intends to terminate any Plan.

         5.10. Accuracy of Information. (a) No Loan Document or written
statement furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the
Administrative Agent or to any Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or
compliance with, the Loan Documents contained any material misstatement of fact
or omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading.

                  (b) The consolidated forecasted financial statements of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 6.1.7
were prepared in good faith on the basis of the assumptions stated therein,
which assumptions were fair in light of the conditions existing at the time of
delivery of such forecasts, and represented, at the time of delivery, the
Borrower's reasonable estimate of its future financial performance.

extending credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate of
buying or carrying margin stock (as defined in Regulation U), and after applying

which default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change or (ii) any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness.

         5.13. Compliance with Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or

         5.15. Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. The Borrower is not an
entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of
Loans hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

         5.16. Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business,
the officers of the Borrower consider the effect of Environmental Laws on the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in the course of which they
identify and evaluate potential risks and liabilities accruing to the Borrower
due to Environmental Laws. On the basis of this consideration, the Borrower has
concluded that Environmental Laws are not reasonably expected to result in a
Material Adverse Change. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material compliance with
any of the requirements of applicable Environmental Laws or are the subject of
any federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is
needed to respond to a release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into
the environment, which non-compliance or remedial action could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         5.17. Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company",
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance
on all their Property in such amounts, subject to such deductibles and
self-insurance retentions and covering such properties and risks as is
consistent with sound business practice.

         5.20. No Default or Unmatured Default. No Default or Unmatured Default
has occurred and is continuing.

         5.21. SDN List Designation. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates is a country, individual or entity named on the
Specifically Designated National and Blocked Persons (SDN) list issued by the
Office of Foreign Asset Control of the Department of the Treasury of the United
States of America.

         5.22. Solvency. Each Credit Party is, individually and together with
its Subsidiaries, Solvent.

         5.23. Senior Indebtedness. The Obligations of the Borrower under the
Loan Documents constitute "Senior Indebtedness" and "Designated Senior
Indebtedness" (each as defined in the Convertible Notes Indenture) for all
purposes under the Convertible Notes Indenture.

         Agent, may reasonably specify.

                  6.1.13 Such other information (including non-financial
         information) as the Administrative Agent or any Lender may from time to

         If any information which is required to be furnished to the Lenders
under this Section 6.1 is required by law or regulation to be filed by the
Borrower with a government body on an earlier date, then the information
required hereunder shall be furnished to the Lenders at such earlier date.

         6.2. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary
to, use the (i) proceeds of the Term B Loans solely for the Refinancing,
repaying the Indebtedness of Tapco and to finance the Tapco Acquisition, in each
case, including payment of the costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries in connection therewith and (ii) the proceeds of the
Revolving Loans for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation,
for working capital and Permitted Acquisitions. The Borrower shall use the
proceeds of Credit Extensions in compliance with all applicable legal and
regulatory requirements and any such use shall not result in a violation of any
such requirements, including, without limitation, Regulation U and X, the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.

         6.3. Notice of Default. Within three (3) Business Days after an
Authorized Officer becomes aware thereof, the Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give notice in writing to the Lenders of the occurrence (i) of

otherwise, which (solely with respect to this clause (ii)) could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

         6.4. Conduct of Business. Except as a result of Acquisitions permitted
under Section 6.13, the Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, carry
on and conduct its business in substantially the same manner and in
substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently conducted and do
all things necessary to remain duly incorporated or organized, validly existing

                                       62
<PAGE>

and (to the extent such concept applies to such entity) in good standing as a
domestic corporation, partnership or limited liability company in its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, as in effect
on the Closing Date, and maintain all requisite authority to conduct its
business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.

         6.5. Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
timely file complete and correct United States federal and applicable foreign,
state and local tax returns required by law and pay when due all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or its income, profits
or Property, except those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside in
accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles; provided, however, that it
shall not be a Default or Unmatured Default under this Section 6.5 if all such
failures in the aggregate do not result in a Material Adverse Change.

         6.6. Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on
all their Property in such amounts, subject to such deductibles and
self-insurance retentions, and covering such risks as is consistent with sound
business practice, and the Borrower will furnish to any Lender upon request full
information as to the insurance carried. The Borrower shall deliver to the
Collateral Agent endorsements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Collateral Agent (x) to all "All Risk" physical damage insurance policies on all
of the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' tangible real and personal property and
assets and business interruption insurance policies naming the Collateral Agent
as loss payee and (y) to all general liability and other liability policies
naming the Collateral Agent as an additional insured. Each such policy shall in
addition (i) contain the agreement by the insurer that any loss thereunder that
exceeds $500,000 shall be payable to the Collateral Agent notwithstanding any
action, inaction or breach of representation or warranty by such Grantor, (ii)
provide that there shall be no recourse against the Collateral Agent for payment
of premiums or other amounts with respect thereto and (iii) provide that at
least 10 days prior written notice of cancellation or of lapse shall be given to
the Collateral Agent by the insurer. Reimbursement under any liability insurance
maintained by any Grantor pursuant to this Section 6.6 may be paid directly to
the Person who shall have incurred liability covered by such insurance. In the
event the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries at any time or times hereafter
shall fail to obtain or maintain any of the policies or insurance required
herein or to pay any premium in whole or in part relating thereto, then the
Collateral Agent, without waiving or releasing any obligations or resulting
Default hereunder, may at any time or times thereafter (but shall be under no
obligation to do so) obtain and maintain such policies of insurance and pay such
premiums and take any other action with respect thereto which the Collateral
Agent deems advisable. All sums so disbursed by the Collateral Agent shall
constitute part of the Obligations, payable as provided in this Agreement.

         6.7. Compliance with Laws. (a) The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply in all material respects with all laws, rules,
regulations, orders, writs, judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which
it may be subject including, without limitation, all Environmental Laws, ERISA
and Section 302 and Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; provided,
however, that it shall not be a Default or Unmatured Default under this Section
6.7(a) if all such failures in the aggregate do not result in a Material Adverse
Change.

lessees and other Persons operating or occupying its properties to, comply with
all applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits; obtain and renew,
and cause each of its Subsidiaries to obtain and renew, all Environmental

of its Subsidiaries to conduct, any investigation, study, sampling and testing,
and undertake any cleanup, removal, remedial or other action necessary to remove
and clean up all Hazardous Materials from any of its properties, in accordance
with the requirements of all Environmental Laws; provided, however, that neither
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to undertake any such
cleanup, removal, remedial or other action to the extent that its obligation to
do so is being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and appropriate
reserves are being maintained with respect to such circumstances; provided,
further, that it shall not be a Default or Unmatured Default under this Section
6.7(b) if all such failures in the aggregate do not result in a Material Adverse
Change.

         6.8. Maintenance of Properties. Subject to Section 6.12, the Borrower
will, and will cause each Subsidiary to, do all things reasonably necessary to
maintain, preserve, protect and keep its Property used in the operation of its
business in good repair, working order and condition, (ordinary wear and tear
excepted), and make all necessary and proper repairs, renewals and replacements
so that its business carried on in connection therewith may be properly
conducted at all times.

         6.9. Inspection; Keeping of Books and Records. The Borrower will, and
will cause each Subsidiary to, permit the Administrative Agent and the Lenders,
by their respective representatives and agents, at the Borrower's expense, to
inspect any of the Property, including, without limitation, the Collateral,
books and financial records of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, to examine and
make copies of the books of accounts and other financial records of the Borrower
and each Subsidiary, and to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the
Borrower and each Subsidiary with, and to be advised as to the same by, their
respective officers at such reasonable times and intervals (and, so long as no
Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the provision of reasonable notice
to the Borrower) as the Administrative Agent or any Lender may designate. The
Borrower shall keep and maintain, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to keep and
maintain, in all material respects, proper books of record and account in which
entries in conformity with Agreement Accounting Principles shall be made of all
dealings and transactions in relation to their respective businesses and
activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default or Unmatured
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower shall not be obligated to
reimburse any costs in connection with its obligations under this Section 6.9,
other than fees and expenses not in excess of $20,000 payable to the
Administrative Agent in connection with not more than one inspection per
calendar year.

         6.10. Restricted Payments. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit
any Subsidiary to, make any Restricted Payment (other than dividends payable in
its own capital stock) except that, (i) any Subsidiary may declare and pay
dividends or make distributions to the Borrower or to a Guarantor and (ii) so
long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists at the time thereof or would
arise after giving effect thereto, the Borrower may make Restricted Payments
pursuant to any of the Borrower Incentive Plans or those Restricted Payments set
forth in Schedule 6.10.

         6.11. Merger or Dissolution. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit
any Subsidiary to, merge or consolidate with or into any other Person or
dissolve, except that:

                  6.11.1 A Guarantor may merge into (x) the Borrower or (y) a
         Wholly-Owned Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor
         promptly upon the completion of the applicable merger or consolidation.

                  6.11.2 A Subsidiary may merge into (x) the Borrower or (y) a
         Wholly-Owned Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or becomes a Guarantor
         promptly upon the completion of the applicable merger or consolidation.

                  6.11.3 The Borrower or any Subsidiary may consummate any
         merger or consolidation in connection with any Permitted Acquisition,
         provided, that the Person formed by such merger or consolidation shall
         be the Borrower or a Guarantor.

                  6.11.4 The Borrower may dissolve any Subsidiary other than a

                  such Acquisition (excluding the exercise of appraisal rights)
                  shall be pending or threatened by any shareholder or director
                  of the seller or entity to be acquired;

         (iii)    the business to be acquired in such Acquisition is similar or

                  together with the Purchase Price not payable in cash (other

                                       66
<PAGE>

                  any Acquisition consummated during a period when the Total
                  Leverage Ratio, after giving pro forma effect to such
                  Acquisition, was less than or equal to 3.50:1.00 shall be
                  disregarded for purposes of determining compliance with this
                  subclause (b); and

         (vi)     prior to the consummation of such Permitted Acquisition, the
                  Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent a
                  pro forma consolidated balance sheet, income statement and
                  cash flow statement of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (the
                  "Acquisition Pro Forma"), based on the Borrower's most recent
                  financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.1.1 and
                  using historical financial statements for the acquired entity
                  provided by the seller(s) or which shall be complete and shall
                  fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
                  condition and results of operations and cash flows of the
                  Borrower and its Subsidiaries in accordance with Agreement
                  Accounting Principles, but taking into account such Permitted
                  Acquisition and the funding of all Indebtedness in connection
                  therewith, and such Acquisition Pro Forma shall reflect that,
                  on a pro forma basis, the Borrower would have been in
                  compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Sections
                  6.21, 6.22 and 6.23 for the four fiscal quarter period
                  reflected in the compliance certificate most recently
                  delivered to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section
                  6.1.3 prior to the consummation of such Permitted Acquisition
                  (giving effect to such Permitted Acquisition and all
                  Indebtedness funded in connection therewith as if made on the
                  first day of such period).

         Subsidiary owns less than 100% of the issued and outstanding equity
         interests thereof, including the Investments described in Schedule
         6.13(B), provided that Investments made after the date of this
         Agreement do not exceed, over the term of this Agreement, an amount
         equal to $10 million plus an aggregate amount equal to 2% of
         Consolidated EBITDA for each twelve month period following the Closing
         Date (the "Minority Investment Base Amount"); provided further that if
         the aggregate amount of such Investments actually made in any one
         fiscal year of the Borrower are actually less than the Minority
         Investment Base Amount (the difference being the "Shortfall Amount"),
         then, so long as no Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and is
         continuing, the permitted amount of such Investments during the
         immediately succeeding fiscal year only shall be an amount equal to the
         Minority Investment Base Amount plus the Shortfall Amount.

                  6.13.5 Creation of or Investment in a Subsidiary that is or
         becomes immediately following such creation or Investment a Guarantor.

         assets used in its business, if (1) the total of all such Indebtedness
         for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken together incurred on or
         after the Closing Date shall not exceed an aggregate principal amount
         of $1,000,000 at any one time outstanding, (2) such Indebtedness when

         refinancing, and (4) any Lien securing such Indebtedness is permitted
         under Section 6.15 (such Indebtedness being referred to herein as
         "Permitted Purchase Money Indebtedness").

                  6.14.5 Indebtedness arising from intercompany loans and

                  (ii) shortens or accelerates the date upon which any
         installment of principal or interest becomes due or adds any additional
         mandatory redemption provisions;

                  (iii) shortens the final maturity date of such Indebtedness or
         otherwise accelerates the amortization schedule with respect to such
         Indebtedness;

         Indebtedness;

                  (v) provides for the payment of additional fees or increases

                  (vi) amends or modifies any financial or negative covenant (or
         covenant which prohibits or restricts the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries from taking certain actions) in a manner which is more
         onerous or more restrictive in any material respect to the Borrower or
         such Subsidiary or which is otherwise materially adverse to the
         Borrower, its Subsidiaries and/or the Lenders or, in the case of any
         such covenant, which places material additional restrictions on the
         Borrower or such Subsidiary or which requires the Borrower or such
         Subsidiary to comply with more restrictive financial ratios or which
         requires the Borrower to better its financial performance, in each case
         from that set forth in the existing applicable covenants in the
         Subordinated Indebtedness Documents or the applicable covenants in this
         Agreement; or

                  (vii) amends, modifies or adds any affirmative covenant in a
         manner which (a) when taken as a whole, is materially adverse to the
         Borrower, its Subsidiaries and/or the Lenders or (b) is more onerous
         than the existing applicable covenant in the Subordinated Indebtedness
         Documents or the applicable covenant in this Agreement.

         6.21. Leverage Ratios.

                  6.21.1 Total Leverage Ratio. The Borrower will not permit the
         ratio (the "Total Leverage Ratio"), determined as of the end of each of
         its fiscal quarters set forth below, of (i) Consolidated Funded
         Indebtedness of the Borrower to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the then
         most recently ended four fiscal quarters to be greater than the ratio
         set forth for such period below:

         For each four fiscal quarter period ended:       Total Leverage Ratio
         ------------------------------------------       --------------------

         March 31, 2006 through June 30, 2006                    4.25:1.00
         September 30, 2006                                      4.00:1.00

           Maturity Date                                         3.50:1.00


                  6.21.2 Senior Leverage Ratio. The Borrower will not permit the
         ratio (the "Senior Leverage Ratio"), determined as of the end of each
         of its fiscal quarters set forth below, of (i) Consolidated Funded
         Indebtedness of the Borrower minus Subordinated Indebtedness of the
         Borrower and its Subsidiaries to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA for the then
         most-recently ended four fiscal quarters to be greater than the ratio
         set forth for such period below:

         For each four fiscal quarter period ended:     Senior Leverage Ratio
         ------------------------------------------     ---------------------
         September 30, 2004 through December 31, 2004         4.00:1.00
         March 31, 2005 through June 30, 2005                 3.75:1.00
         September 30, 2005 through December 31, 2005         3.50:1.00

           Maturity Date                                      2.50:1.00

         The Total Leverage Ratio and the Senior Leverage Ratio shall be
         calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Borrower
         based upon (a) for Consolidated Funded Indebtedness and, if relevant,
         Subordinated Indebtedness, Consolidated Funded Indebtedness and
         Subordinated Indebtedness as of the last day of each such fiscal
         quarter and (b) for Consolidated EBITDA, the actual amount as of the
         last day of each fiscal quarter for the most recently ended four
         consecutive fiscal quarters.

         6.22. Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. The Borrower will not permit the
ratio (the "Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio"), determined as of the end of each
Measurement Period, of (i) Consolidated EBITDAR minus Consolidated Capital
Expenditures minus expenses for taxes paid in cash or taxes accrued during such

                                       73
<PAGE>

period (which shall be deemed to be $10,800,000 for the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2004) to (ii) Consolidated Future Maturities following such period
(including, without limitation, Capitalized Lease Obligations) plus Consolidated
Interest Expense during such period plus Rentals to be paid during such period,
all calculated for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, to
be less than (x) for each Measurement Period ending on or prior to September 30,
2006, 1.10:1.00 and (y) for each Measurement Period ending after September 30,
2006, 1.25:1.00.

         6.23. Capital Expenditures. Other than the Capital Expenditures set
forth on Schedule 6.23, the Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, expend, or be committed to expend, in excess of an aggregate amount for
Capital Expenditures of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries during any fiscal year
of the Borrower to be greater than the amount set forth for such fiscal year
below:

         For fiscal year:                      Capital Expenditures
         ----------------                      --------------------
         2005 through 2006                         $50,000,000
         2007 through 2010                         $55,000,000
         2011                                      $60,000,000

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the amount of Capital
Expenditures permitted to be made in any fiscal year (before giving effect to
any increase in such permitted expenditure amount pursuant to this sentence)
exceeds the amount of Capital Expenditures made during such fiscal year, such
excess may be carried forward and utilized to make Capital Expenditures in the
next succeeding fiscal year.

         6.24. Rentals. The Borrower shall not permit, nor shall it permit any
Subsidiary to, create, pay or incur aggregate Rentals in excess of five percent
(5%) of Consolidated Total Assets for any fiscal year during the term of this
Agreement on a consolidated basis for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

         6.25. Guarantors. The Borrower shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to
guarantee pursuant to the Guaranty Agreement or supplement thereto (or, in the
case of a Foreign Subsidiary, any other guarantee agreement requested by the
Administrative Agent) the Secured Obligations. In furtherance of the above, the
Borrower shall promptly (and in any event within 45 days thereof, except as
otherwise provided in Section 6.32) (i) provide written notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders upon any Person becoming a Subsidiary,
setting forth information in reasonable detail describing all of the assets of
such Person, (ii) cause such Person to execute a supplement to the Guaranty
Agreement and such other Collateral Documents as are necessary for the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries to comply with Section 6.26, (iii) cause the Applicable
Pledge Percentage of the issued and outstanding equity interests of such Person
to be delivered to the Administrative Agent (together with undated stock powers
signed in blank, if applicable) and pledged to the Administrative Agent pursuant
to an appropriate pledge agreement(s) in substantially the form of the Pledge
and Security Agreement (or joinder or other supplement thereto) and otherwise in

                                       74
<PAGE>

form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and (iv) deliver such
other documentation as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing, including, without limitation, certified
resolutions and other authority documents of such Person and, to the extent
requested by the Administrative Agent, favorable opinions of counsel to such
Person (which shall cover, among other things, the legality, validity, binding
effect and enforceability of the documentation referred to above), all in form,
content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Foreign Subsidiary shall be required to
execute and deliver the Guaranty Agreement (or supplement thereto) or such other
guarantee agreement if such execution and delivery would cause a Deemed Dividend
Problem or a Financial Assistance Problem with respect to such Foreign
Subsidiary and, in lieu thereof, the Borrower and the relevant Subsidiaries
shall provide the pledge agreements required under this Section 6.25 or Section
6.26. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the aggregate EBITDA of
FlexCrete Building Systems, L.C., Florida N-Viro, L.P. and Florida N-Viro
Management, LLC for the most recently completed four fiscal quarter period does
not exceed one percent (1%) of the Consolidated EBITDA for the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries for the same period, the Borrower shall not be required to cause
FlexCrete Building Systems, L.C., Florida N-Viro, L.P. or Florida N-Viro
Management, LLC to guarantee the Secured Obligations.

         6.26. Collateral; Environmental Reports. (a) Subject to the exceptions
set forth in this Section 6.26, the Borrower will cause, and will cause each
other Credit Party to cause, all of its owned Property whether now or hereafter
acquired (other than Exempt Property) to be subject at all times to first
priority perfected Liens in favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Holders of Secured Obligations to secure the Secured Obligations in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents, subject in
any case to Liens permitted by Section 6.15 hereof. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will cause the Applicable Pledge
Percentage of the issued and outstanding equity interests of each Pledge
Subsidiary directly owned by the Borrower or any other Credit Party to be
subject at all times to a first priority, perfected Lien in favor of the
Administrative Agent to secure the Secured Obligations in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents or such other security
documents as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (1) no pledge agreement in respect of the equity interests of a
Foreign Subsidiary shall be required hereunder to the extent such pledge
thereunder is prohibited by applicable law or the Administrative Agent
reasonably determines that such pledge would not provide material credit support
for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations pursuant to legally valid,
binding and enforceable pledge agreements and (2) no such pledge agreement shall
be required to be delivered hereunder with respect to Foreign Subsidiaries
existing as of the Closing Date, unless otherwise determined in the reasonable
discretion of the Administrative Agent upon 45 days notice to the Borrower.

         (b) The Borrower will cause, and will cause each other Credit Party to
cause all of its Real Property Collateral whether now or hereafter acquired or
leased to be subject at all times to first priority perfected Liens in favor of
the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations
to secure the Secured Obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the Collateral Documents, subject in each case to Liens created or permitted by
the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, such items that will
constitute Permitted Encumbrances and Liens set forth on Schedule 6.15. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Borrower will, and will cause each
Guarantor to, deliver Mortgages and, to the extent applicable, Mortgage
Instruments with respect to the Real Property Collateral to the extent, and
within such time period as is, reasonably required by the Administrative Agent;

                                       75
<PAGE>

provided, however, that with respect to the Real Property Collateral existing as
of the Closing Date, no such Mortgages, Mortgage Instruments and pledge
agreements are required to be delivered hereunder until 90 days following the
Closing Date with respect to Real Property Collateral that comprises 75% of the
book value of all Real Property Collateral and 120 days following the Closing
Date with respect to all other Real Property Collateral (it being understood and
agreed that the failure to deliver such Mortgages, Mortgage Instruments and
pledge agreements by 120 days following the Closing Date or such date 30 days
later as the Administrative Agent may agree in its sole discretion shall
constitute a Default under Section 7.3); provided that the Borrower hereby
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the delivery of such Mortgages and
Mortgage Instruments as soon as practicable after the Closing Date. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in addition to each Mortgage delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.26, the Administrative Agent shall receive the
following items with respect to the Real Property Collateral (collectively, the
"Mortgage Instruments"):

                  (A) evidence that counterparts of the Mortgages have been duly
         executed, acknowledged and delivered and are in form suitable for
         filing or recording in all filing or recording offices that the
         Administrative Agent may deem necessary or desirable in order to create
         a valid first and subsisting Lien on the property described therein in
         favor of the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Holders of
         Secured Obligations and that all applicable filing and recording taxes
         and fees have been paid,

                  (B) with respect to the Real Property Collateral, fully paid
         American Land Title Association Lender's Extended Coverage title
         insurance policies (the "Mortgage Policies") in form and substance,
         with endorsements and in amount reasonably acceptable to the
         Administrative Agent, issued by Chicago Title Insurance Company,
         insuring the Mortgages of the Real Property Collateral to be valid
         first and subsisting Liens on the property described therein, free and
         clear of all defects (including, but not limited to, mechanics' and
         materialmen's Liens) and encumbrances, excepting only Permitted
         Encumbrances, and providing for such other affirmative insurance
         (including endorsements for future advances under the Loan Documents
         and for mechanics' and materialmen's Liens) and such direct access
         reinsurance as the Administrative Agent may reasonably require,

                  (C) with respect to the Real Property Collateral, American
         Land Title Association/American Congress on Surveying and Mapping form
         surveys, for which all necessary fees (where applicable) have been
         paid, and dated no more than 60 days before the filing of the related
         Mortgage or such other date as the Administrative Agent shall
         reasonably determine; provided that Chicago Title Insurance Company
         shall agree to omit the general survey exception to the applicable
         Mortgage Policy on the basis of such survey, certified to the
         Administrative Agent and Chicago Title Insurance Company in a manner
         satisfactory to the Administrative Agent by a land surveyor duly
         registered and licensed in the States in which the property described
         in such surveys is located and acceptable to the Administrative Agent,
         showing all buildings and other improvements, any off-site
         improvements, the location of any easements, parking spaces, rights of
         way, building set-back lines and other dimensional regulations and the
         absence of encroachments, either by such improvements or on to such

                                       76
<PAGE>

         property, and other defects, other than encroachments and other defects
         acceptable to the Administrative Agent or for which affirmative
         reinsurance coverage is provided in the Mortgage Policies,

                  (D) such consents and agreements of third parties, and such
         estoppel letters and other confirmations, as the Administrative Agent
         may deem necessary or desirable,

                  (E) evidence of the insurance required by the terms of the
         Mortgages,

                  (F) evidence that all other action that the Administrative
         Agent may deem necessary or desirable in order to create valid first
         and subsisting Liens on the property described in the Mortgages has
         been taken,

                  (G) favorable opinions of local counsel for the Credit Parties
         (i) in states in which the Real Property Collateral is located, with
         respect to the enforceability and perfection of the Mortgages and any
         related fixture filings substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto
         and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
         Agent and (ii) in states in which the Credit Parties party to the
         Mortgages are organized or formed, with respect to the valid existence,
         corporate power and authority of such Credit Parties in the granting of
         the Mortgages, in substantially the form of Exhibit A-3 hereto, and
         otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative
         Agent.

         (c) The Borrower shall, within 30 days of the Closing Date (which may
be extended by up to an additional 30 days in the sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent), cause, and cause each other Credit Party to cause, all of
its Deposit Accounts (as defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) and
securities accounts (as defined in the New York Uniform Commercial Code) to be
subject to Account Control Agreements or Securities Account Control Agreements
(each as defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement), as applicable,
acceptable to the Collateral Agent and subject to any exceptions set forth in
the Pledge and Security Agreement.

         (d) Within 45 days of the Closing Date the Borrower shall deliver to
the Lenders a Phase I environmental assessment report, from an environmental
consulting firm acceptable to the Lenders, which report shall identify existing
and potential environmental concerns, and shall quantify related costs and
liabilities, associated with all of the Real Property Collateral and the Lenders
shall be satisfied with the Borrower's plans with respect thereto and if so
recommended by any such Phase I report, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Lenders within 60 days of the Closing Date a Phase II environmental assessment
report with respect to the applicable site and the Lenders shall be satisfied
with the Borrower's plans with respect to the matters addressed therein.

         (e) The Borrower shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of Brown Brothers Harriman within 90 days of the Closing Date
to the grant by ACM Block & Brick, and shall cause ACM Block & Brick to so
grant, of a perfected second priority lien, on terms satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, on all property securing the BBH Debt in favor of the
Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Secured Obligations. If such
consent is not obtained within 90 days of the Closing Date, the Borrower shall
cause the BBH Debt to be repaid in full and cause ACM Block & Brick to grant a
perfected first priority lien, on terms satisfactory to the Administrative

                                       77
<PAGE>

Agent, on all property securing the BBH Debt in favor of the Collateral Agent on
behalf of the Holders of the Secured Obligations. Simultaneously with the
granting of the liens contemplated by this Section 6.26(e), the Borrower shall
cause ACM Block & Brick to satisfy all requirements of this Section 6.26 and of
the Pledge and Security Agreement as they apply to Collateral with respect to
the property being so pledged. Upon the granting of a first lien security
interest in the property secured by the BBH Debt to the Collateral Agent on

Block & Brick to comply with the provisions of Section 6.6 as they relate to
such property.

         (f) Within 14 days of the Closing Date, the Borrower shall cause Tapco

Brick with a fair market value in the aggregate over the term of the Agreement

property to pay all proceeds payable under such policies or with respect to such
claim or award for any loss with respect to the Collateral directly to the

Agent.

Subsidiary to become a general partner in any general or limited partnership or
joint venture, other than any Subsidiary the sole assets of which consist of its
interest in such partnership or joint venture.

         6.32. Negative Pledge. The Borrower shall not enter into or suffer to
exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or suffer to exist, any
agreement prohibiting or conditioning the creation or assumption of any Lien
upon any of its property or assets except (i) under this Agreement, (ii) under
the Second Lien Credit Agreement, (iii) in any agreement governing Permitted
Indebtedness so long as the terms of such prohibitions or conditions on the

                                       78
<PAGE>

creation or assumption of Liens are no more restrictive than the terms hereof
and permit the creation or assumption of Liens securing the Obligations of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement and (iv) (A) any such
prohibitions or conditions in effect on the Closing Date, (B) in any agreement
governing any purchase money Indebtedness permitted by Section 6.14.4 solely to
the extent that the agreement or instrument governing such Indebtedness
prohibits a Lien on the property acquired with the proceeds of such
Indebtedness, (C) in any agreement governing any Capitalized Lease permitted by
Section 6.14.9 solely to the extent that such Capitalized Lease prohibits a Lien
on the property subject thereto, or (D) in any agreement governing any

                                    DEFAULTS

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                 ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

         8.1. Acceleration.

         (i)      If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 occurs with
                  respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to
                  make Loans hereunder and the obligation and power of the LC
                  Issuers to issue Facility LCs shall automatically terminate
                  and the Secured Obligations shall immediately become due and
                  payable without any election or action on the part of the
                  Administrative Agent, any LC Issuer or any Lender, and the
                  Borrower will be and become thereby unconditionally obligated,
                  without any further notice, act or demand, to pay the
                  Administrative Agent an amount in immediately available funds,
                  which funds shall be held in the Facility LC Collateral
                  Account, equal to the difference of (x) the amount of LC
                  Obligations at such time less (y) the amount or deposit in the
                  Facility LC Collateral Account at such time which is free and
                  clear of all rights and claims of third parties and has not
                  been applied against the Obligations (the "Collateral
                  Shortfall Amount"). If any other Default occurs, the Required
                  Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the consent of the
                  Required Lenders) may (a) terminate or suspend the obligations
                  of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and the obligation and
                  power of the LC Issuers to issue Facility LCs, or declare the
                  Secured Obligations to be due and payable, or both, whereupon
                  the Secured Obligations shall become immediately due and
                  payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any
                  kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives and
                  (b) upon notice to the Borrower and in addition to the
                  continuing right to demand payment of all amounts payable
                  under this Agreement, make demand on the Borrower to pay, and
                  the Borrower will forthwith upon such demand and without any
                  further notice or act pay to the Administrative Agent the
                  Collateral Shortfall Amount which funds shall be deposited in
                  the Facility LC Collateral Account.

         (ii)     If at any time while any Default is continuing, the
                  Administrative Agent determines that the Collateral Shortfall
                  Amount at such time is greater than zero, the Administrative
                  Agent may make demand on the Borrower to pay, and the Borrower
                  will, forthwith upon such demand and without any further
                  notice or act, pay to the Administrative Agent the Collateral
                  Shortfall Amount, which funds shall be deposited in the
                  Facility LC Collateral Account.

         (iii)    The Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time
                  after funds are deposited in the Facility LC Collateral
                  Account, apply such funds to the payment of the Secured
                  Obligations and any other amounts as shall from time to time
                  have become due and payable by the Borrower to the Lenders or
                  the LC Issuers under the Loan Documents.

         (iv)     At any time while any Default is continuing, neither the
                  Borrower nor any Person claiming on behalf of or through the

                                       82
<PAGE>

                  Borrower shall have any right to withdraw any of the funds
                  held in the Facility LC Collateral Account. After all of the
                  Secured Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and
                  the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment, the LC Sublimit and
                  Aggregate Term Loan B Commitment have been terminated, any
                  funds remaining in the Facility LC Collateral Account shall be
                  returned by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower or paid
                  to whomever may be legally entitled thereto at such time.

         (v)      If, after acceleration of the maturity of the Obligations or
                  termination of the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans
                  and the obligation and power of the LC Issuers to issue
                  Facility LCs hereunder as a result of any Default (other than
                  any Default as described in Section 7.6 or 7.7 with respect to
                  the Borrower) and before any judgment or decree for the
                  payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or
                  entered, the Required Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall
                  so direct, the Administrative Agent shall, by notice to the
                  Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or
                  termination.

         8.2. Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Section 8.2 and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with
the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into
agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any
provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the
Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder
or thereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall,
without the consent of all of the Lenders (other than any Lender that is, at
such time, a Defaulting Lender), except for any amendment, waiver or consent
with respect to the items set forth in Sections 8.2.1 and 8.2.3, which shall
only require the consent of all of the Lenders directly affected by such
amendment, waiver or consent:

                  8.2.1 Extend the Revolving Loan Termination Date, extend the
         final maturity of any Revolving Loan or extend the expiry date of any
         Facility LC to a date after the Revolving Loan Termination Date, extend
         the final maturity date of any Term B Loan to a date after the Term
         Loan B Maturity Date, or postpone any regularly scheduled payment of
         principal of any Loan or forgive all or any portion of the principal
         amount thereof, or any Reimbursement Obligation related thereto, or
         reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or fees
         thereon or Reimbursement Obligations related thereto (other than (x) a
         waiver of the application of the default rate of interest pursuant to
         Section 2.11 hereof and (y) any reduction of the amount of or any
         extension of the payment date for the mandatory payments required under
         Section 2.2, in each case which shall only require the approval of the
         Required Lenders).

                  8.2.2 Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
         Required Lenders or any other percentage of Lenders specified to be the
         applicable percentage in this Agreement to act on specified matters or
         amend the definition of "Pro Rata Share", "Revolving Loan Pro Rata
         Share" or "Term Loan Pro Rata Share".

                  8.2.3 Increase the amount of the Revolving Loan Commitment or
         Term Loan B Commitment of any Lender hereunder.

                                       83
<PAGE>

                  8.2.4 Amend this Section 8.2, or permit the Borrower to assign
         its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

                  8.2.5 Other than in connection with a transaction permitted
         under this Agreement, release all or substantially all of the
         Collateral.

                  8.2.6 Other than in connection with a transaction permitted
         under this Agreement, release any Guarantor from its obligations
         thereunder.

If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver, or consent, the consent
of all of the Lenders, or all of the Lenders directly affected thereby, is
required pursuant to this Section 8.2, and any such Lender refuses to consent to
such amendment, waiver or consent (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained
as described in this Section 8.2 being referred to as a "Non-Consenting
Lender"), then, so long as the Administrative Agent is not a Non-Consenting
Lender, at the Borrower's request, the Administrative Agent or an Eligible
Assignee shall be entitled (but shall have no obligation) to purchase from such
Non-Consenting Lender, and such Non-Consenting Lender (by its acceptance of the
benefits of the applicable Loan Documents) agrees that it shall, upon the
Administrative Agent's request, sell and assign to the Administrative Agent or
such Eligible Assignee, all of the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender or
Non-Consenting Lenders for an amount equal to the principal balance of all Loans
held by the Non-Consenting Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect
thereto through the date of sale. Each Lender (by its acceptance of the benefits
of the Loan Documents) agrees that, if it becomes a Non-Consenting Lender, it
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and
Acceptance to evidence such sale and purchase and shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent any Note (if the assigning Lender's Loans are evidenced by
Notes) subject to such Assignment and Acceptance; provided, however, that the
failure of any Non-Consenting Lender to execute an Assignment and Acceptance
shall not render such sale and purchase (and the corresponding assignment)
ineffective.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to or affecting the
Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may waive payment of the fee
without obtaining the consent of any other party to this Agreement. No amendment
of any provision of this Agreement relating to or affecting the Swing Line
Lender or any Swing Line Loan shall be effective without the written consent of
the Swing Line Lender. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating
to or affecting any LC Issuer shall be effective without the written consent of
such LC Issuer.

         8.3. Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders, the
LC Issuers or the Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan
Documents shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default
or an acquiescence therein, and the making of a Credit Extension notwithstanding
the existence of a Default or Unmatured Default or the inability of the Borrower
to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Credit Extension shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by, or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of, the
requisite number of Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.2, and then only to

                                       84
<PAGE>

the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the
Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available
to the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders until all of the
Secured Obligations have been paid in full.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1. Survival of Representations. All representations and warranties of
the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making of the Credit
Extensions herein contemplated.

         9.2. Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement to
the contrary notwithstanding, neither any LC Issuer nor any Lender shall be
obligated to extend credit to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or
prohibition provided by any applicable statute or regulation.

         9.3. Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.4. Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire agreement
and understanding among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers
and the Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the LC Issuers and the Lenders relating to
the subject matter thereof other than those contained in the fee letter
described in Section 10.13 which shall survive and remain in full force and
effect during the term of this Agreement.

         9.5. Several Obligations; Benefits of This Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to
confer any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that
the parties hereto expressly agree that the Lead Arrangers shall enjoy the
benefits of the provisions of Sections 9.6, 9.10 and 10.11 to the extent
specifically set forth therein and shall have the right to enforce such
provisions on its own behalf and in its own name to the same extent as if it
were a party to this Agreement.

         9.6. Expenses; Indemnification. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse the
Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers for any reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and time charges
of attorneys for the Administrative Agent) paid or incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lead Arrangers in connection with the investigation,
preparation, negotiation, documentation, execution, delivery, syndication,
distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet), review,

                                       85
<PAGE>

amendment, modification and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower
also agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the LC
Issuers and the Lenders for any reasonable costs, internal charges and
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and paralegals' fees and
time charges and expenses of attorneys and paralegals for the Administrative
Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the LC Issuers and the Lenders, which attorneys and
paralegals may be employees of the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the
LC Issuers or the Lenders) paid or incurred by the Administrative Agent, the
Lead Arrangers, the LC Issuers or any Lender in connection with the collection
and enforcement of the Loan Documents. Expenses being reimbursed by the Borrower
under this Section include, without limitation, the cost and expense of
obtaining an appraisal of each parcel of real property or interest in real
property described in any relevant Collateral Document, which appraisal shall be
in conformity with the applicable requirements of any law or any governmental
rule, regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the
force of law), or any interpretation thereof, and any rules promulgated to
implement such provisions and costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
Reports described in the following sentence.

                  (ii) The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, each LC Issuer, each Lender, their
respective affiliates, and each of their directors, officers and employees
against all losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and
out-of-pocket expenses (including, without limitation, all expenses of
litigation or preparation therefor whether or not the Administrative Agent, the
Lead Arrangers, any LC Issuer, any Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto,
and all attorneys' and paralegals' fees, time charges and expenses of attorneys
and paralegals of the party seeking indemnification, which attorneys and
paralegals may or may not be employees of such party seeking indemnification)
which any of them may pay or incur arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the other Loan Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or
indirect application or proposed application of the proceeds of any Credit
Extension hereunder except to the extent that they are determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party seeking
indemnification. The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 9.6 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

         9.7. Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing documents,
and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Administrative Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Administrative Agent may furnish one to each
of the Lenders, as shall have been reasonably requested of the Borrower by the
Administrative Agent.

         9.8. Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used in the calculation of any financial covenant or test shall
be interpreted and all accounting determinations hereunder in the calculation of
any financial covenant or test shall be made in accordance with Agreement
Accounting Principles. If any changes in generally accepted accounting
principles are hereafter required or permitted and are adopted by the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries with the agreement of its independent certified
public accountants and such changes result in a change in the method of
calculation of any of the financial covenants, tests, restrictions or standards
herein or in the related definitions or terms used therein ("Accounting
Changes"), the parties hereto agree, at the Borrower's request, to enter into
negotiations, in good faith, in order to amend such provisions in a credit
neutral manner so as to reflect equitably such changes with the desired result
that the criteria for evaluating the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries' financial

                                       86
<PAGE>

condition shall be the same after such changes as if such changes had not been
made; provided, however, until such provisions are amended in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, no
Accounting Change shall be given effect in such calculations. In the event such
amendment is entered into, all references in this Agreement to Agreement
Accounting Principles shall mean generally accepted accounting principles as of
the date of such amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all financial
statements to be delivered by the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in effect
at such time.

         9.9. Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10. Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower on
the one hand and the Lenders, the LC Issuers and the Administrative Agent on the
other hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the
Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, any LC Issuer nor any Lender shall
have any fiduciary responsibilities to the Borrower. Neither the Administrative
Agent, the Lead Arrangers, any LC Issuer nor any Lender undertakes any
responsibility to the Borrower to review or inform the Borrower of any matter in
connection with any phase of the Borrower's business or operations. The Borrower
agrees that neither the Administrative Agent, the Lead Arrangers, any LC Issuer
nor any Lender shall have liability to the Borrower (whether sounding in tort,
contract or otherwise) for losses suffered by the Borrower in connection with,
arising out of, or in any way related to, the transactions contemplated and the
relationship established by the Loan Documents, or any act, omission or event
occurring in connection therewith, unless it is determined in a final
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction that such losses
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the party from which
recovery is sought. None of the parties hereto shall have any liability with
respect to, and each party hereto hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue
for, any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages suffered by any
such party in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan
Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby.

         9.11. Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees
to hold any confidential information which it may receive from the Borrower in
connection with this Agreement in confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its
Affiliates and to the Administrative Agent and any other Lender and their
respective Affiliates, to the extent such Person is or is reasonably expected to
be involved in the evaluation of such information in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants,
and other professional advisors to such Lender or to a Transferee, (iii) to
regulatory officials, (iv) to any Person as required by law, regulation, or
legal process, or to any Person as required in connection with any legal
proceeding to which it is a party, provided that the Borrower shall have
received prior written notice of such disclosure to the extent such notice is
permitted and the disclosing party shall have taken all steps reasonably
requested by the Borrower to protect the confidentiality of the information so
disclosed, (v) to its direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements or to legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors to
such counterparties, to the extent required in connection with such swap
agreements, (vi) permitted by Section 12.4, and (vii) to rating agencies subject
to confidentiality restrictions reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, if

                                       87
<PAGE>

requested or required by such agencies in connection with a rating relating to
the Credit Extensions hereunder. Without limiting Section 9.4, the Borrower
agrees that the terms of this Section 9.11 shall set forth the entire agreement
between the Borrower and each Lender (including the Administrative Agent) with
respect to any confidential information previously or hereafter received by such
Lender in connection with this Agreement, and this Section 9.11 shall supersede
any and all prior confidentiality agreements entered into by such Lender with
respect to such confidential information.

         9.12. Nonreliance. Each Lender hereby represents that it is not relying
on or looking to any margin stock (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in
the extension or maintenance of the credit provided for herein.

         9.13. Disclosure. The Borrower and each Lender, including the LC
Issuers, hereby acknowledge and agree that each Lender and/or its Affiliates
from time to time may hold investments in, make other loans to or have other
relationships with the Borrower and its Affiliates.

         9.14. Performance of Obligations. The Borrower agrees that the
Administrative Agent may, but shall have no obligation to (i) at any time, pay
or discharge taxes, liens, security interests or other encumbrances levied or
placed on or threatened against any Collateral and (ii) after the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Default make any other payment or perform any act
required of the Borrower under any Loan Document or take any other action which
the Administrative Agent in its discretion deems necessary or desirable to
protect or preserve the Collateral, including, without limitation, any action to
(x) effect any repairs or obtain any insurance called for by the terms of any of
the Loan Documents and to pay all or any part of the premiums therefor and the
costs thereof and (y) pay any rents payable by the Borrower which are more than
30 days past due, or as to which the landlord has given notice of termination,
under any lease. The Administrative Agent shall use its best efforts to give the
Borrower notice of any action taken under this Section 9.14 prior to the taking
of such action or promptly thereafter provided the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect thereof. The Borrower
agrees to pay the Administrative Agent, upon demand, the principal amount of all
funds advanced by the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.14, together
with interest thereon at the rate from time to time applicable to Floating Rate
Loans from the date of such advance until the outstanding principal balance
thereof is paid in full. If the Borrower fails to make payment in respect of any
such advance under this Section 9.14 within one (1) Business Day after the date
the Borrower receives written demand therefor from the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender and each Lender agrees
that it shall thereupon make available to the Administrative Agent, in Dollars
in immediately available funds, the amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share
of such advance. If such funds are not made available to the Administrative
Agent by such Lender within one (1) Business Day after the Administrative
Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent will be entitled to recover
any such amount from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal
Funds Effective Rate for each day during the period commencing on the date of
such demand and ending on the date such amount is received. The failure of any
Lender to make available to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata Share of any
such unreimbursed advance under this Section 9.14 shall neither relieve any

                                       88
<PAGE>

other Lender of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative
Agent such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such advance on the date such
payment is to be made nor increase the obligation of any other Lender to make
such payment to the Administrative Agent. All outstanding principal of, and
interest on, advances made under this Section 9.14 shall constitute Obligations
secured by the Collateral until paid in full by the Borrower.

         9.15. USA Patriot Act Notification. The following notification is
provided to the Borrower pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of 2001,
31 U.S.C. Section 5318:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the
government of the United States of America fight the funding of terrorism and
money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to
obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each Person that opens an
account, including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other
extension of credit, or other financial services product. Accordingly, when the
Borrower opens an account, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders will ask for
the Borrower's name, tax identification number, business address, and other
information that will allow the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to identify
the Borrower. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders may also ask to see the
Borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

                                   THE AGENTS

         10.1. Appointment; Nature of Relationship. MSSF is hereby appointed by
each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the
"Administrative Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each
of the Lenders irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as the
contractual representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. MS&Co. is hereby appointed by
each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the
"Collateral Agent" and, together with the Administrative Agent, the "Agents")
hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders
irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to act as the contractual
representative of such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. Each of the Agents agrees to act as such
contractual representative upon the express conditions contained in this Article
X. Notwithstanding the use of the defined terms "Administrative Agent" and
"Collateral Agent" it is expressly understood and agreed that the Agents shall
not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any of the Holders of Secured
Obligations by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the
Agents are merely acting as the contractual representative of the Lenders with
only those duties as are expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, each
of the Agents (i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the
Holders of Secured Obligations, (ii) is a "representative" of the Holders of
Secured Obligations within the meaning of the term "secured party" as defined in
the New York Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent
contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set
forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders, for

                                       89
<PAGE>

itself and on behalf of its Affiliates as Holders of Secured Obligations, hereby
agrees to assert no claim against either of the Agents on any agency theory or
any other theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims
each Holder of Secured Obligations hereby waives.

         10.2. Powers. Each of the Agents shall have and may exercise such
powers under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to such Agent by
the terms of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Neither Agent shall have any implied duties or fiduciary
duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the Lenders to take any action
thereunder except any action specifically provided by the Loan Documents to be
taken by such Agent.

         10.3. General Immunity. Neither Agent nor any of its respective
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrower, or any
Lender or Holder of Secured Obligations for any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it or them hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection
herewith or therewith except to the extent such action or inaction is determined
in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
arisen from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         10.4. No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, Etc. Neither Agent nor any
of their respective directors, officers, agents or employees shall be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any
statement, warranty or representation made in connection with any Loan Document
or any borrowing hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including,
without limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly
to each Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV,
in the case of the Administrative Agent, except receipt of items required to be
delivered solely to the Administrative Agent; (d) the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Unmatured Default; (e) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other
instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith; (f) the value,
sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any Collateral; or
(g) the financial condition of the Borrower or any guarantor of any of the
Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such guarantor's respective
Subsidiaries. Neither Agent shall have any duty to disclose to the Lenders
information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to such Agent
at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower such Agent (either in
its capacity as such Agent or in its individual capacity).

         10.5. Action on Instructions of Lenders. Each Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under
any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in the event that and to the extent that
this Agreement expressly requires such), and such instructions and any action
taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders.
The Lenders hereby acknowledge that neither Agent shall be under any duty to
take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall be
requested in writing to do so by the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders in
the event that and to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires such).
Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action

                                       90
<PAGE>

hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall first be indemnified
to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and all liability, cost
and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action.

         10.6. Employment of Agents and Counsel. Each Agent may execute any of
its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. Each Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between such Agent and the
Lenders and all matters pertaining to such Agent's duties hereunder and under
any other Loan Document.

         10.7. Reliance on Documents; Counsel. Each Agent shall be entitled to
rely upon any Note, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex, electronic mail message, statement, paper or document believed
by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by the proper
person or persons, and, in respect to legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel
selected by such Agent, which counsel may be employees of such Agent. For
purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Sections 4.1
and 4.2, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have
consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable
or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from such Lender prior to the applicable date specifying its objection
thereto.

         10.8. Administrative Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The
Lenders agree to reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent ratably in proportion to the Lenders' Pro Rata Shares (i) for
any amounts not reimbursed by the Borrower for which such Agent is entitled to
reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other
expenses incurred by such Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by such
Agent in connection with any dispute between such Agent and any Lender or
between two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or
the transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any
such amounts incurred by or asserted against such Agent in connection with any
dispute between such Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the
Lenders), or the enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any
such other documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent and (ii) any indemnification
required pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the
provisions thereof. The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall
survive payment of the Secured Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

                                       91
<PAGE>

         10.9. Notice of Default. Neither Agent shall be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless such Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall
give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

         10.10. Rights as a Lender. In the event either Agent is a Lender, such
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Revolving Loan Commitment and its Credit Extensions
as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the
term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, at any time when an Agent is a Lender, unless
the context otherwise indicates, include such Agent in its individual capacity.
Either Agent and their respective Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, and generally engage in any kind of trust, debt, equity or other
transaction, in addition to those contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in which the
Borrower or such Subsidiary is not restricted hereby from engaging with any
other Person. Neither Agent, in its individual capacity, is obligated to remain
a Lender.

         10.11. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the Syndication Agent or any other Lender and based
on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each Lender
also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arrangers, the Syndication
Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         10.12. Successor Agents. (a) The Administrative Agent may resign at any
time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such
resignation to be effective (x) twenty (20) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign, if the
Administrative Agent resigns due to its determination, in its sole discretion,
that being the Administrative Agent poses a conflict of interest for it or (y)
otherwise, upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent or, if no
successor Administrative Agent has been appointed, forty-five (45) days after
the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intention to resign. The
Administrative Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by written
notice received by the Administrative Agent from the Required Lenders, such
removal to be (i) subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is
continuing, the prior written consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld and (ii) effective on the date specified by the Required
Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor
Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have been so

                                       92
<PAGE>

appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning
Administrative Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Administrative Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the
Lenders, a successor Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, the Administrative Agent may at any time without the consent of the
Borrower or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank
as a successor Administrative Agent hereunder. If the Administrative Agent has
resigned or been removed and no successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent
hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations
to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be appointed
hereunder until such successor Administrative Agent has accepted the
appointment. Any such successor Administrative Agent shall be a commercial bank
or other financial institution having capital and retained earnings of at least
$100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Administrative Agent. Upon the
effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent, the
resigning or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations hereunder and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness
of the resignation or removal of an Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such Administrative Agent
in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting
as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the
event that there is a successor to the Administrative Agent by merger, or the
Administrative Agent assigns its duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant
to this Section 10.12, then the term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement
shall mean the prime rate, base rate or other analogous rate of the new
Administrative Agent.

         . (b) The Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective
(x) twenty (20) days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign, if the Collateral Agent resigns due to its determination,
in its sole discretion, that being the Collateral Agent poses a conflict of
interest for it, or (y) otherwise upon the appointment of a successor Collateral
Agent or, if no successor Collateral Agent has been appointed, forty-five (45)
days after the retiring Collateral Agent gives notice of its intention to
resign. The Collateral Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by
written notice received by the Collateral Agent from the Required Lenders, such
removal to be (i) subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is
continuing, the prior written consent of the Borrower, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld and (ii) effective on the date specified by the Required
Lenders. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor
Collateral Agent. If no successor Collateral Agent shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the resigning Collateral
Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning Collateral
Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor
Collateral Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Collateral Agent
may at any time without the consent of the Borrower or any Lender, appoint any
of its Affiliates as a successor Collateral Agent hereunder. If the Collateral
Agent has resigned or been removed and no successor Collateral Agent has been
appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Collateral Agent
hereunder and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations
to the applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder
until such successor Collateral Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such

                                       93
<PAGE>

successor Collateral Agent shall be a commercial bank, trust company or other
financial institution having capital and retained earnings of at least
$100,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Collateral Agent
hereunder by a successor Collateral Agent, such successor Collateral Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the resigning or removed Collateral Agent. Upon the effectiveness
of the resignation or removal of the Collateral Agent, the resigning or removed
Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder
and under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or
removal of a Collateral Agent, the provisions of this Article X shall continue
in effect for the benefit of such Collateral Agent in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Collateral Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

         10.13. Administrative Agent and Lead Arrangers Fees. The Borrower
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arrangers, for their
respective accounts, the fees agreed to by the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lead Arrangers pursuant to that certain letter agreement dated
September 3, 2004, or as otherwise agreed from time to time.

         10.14. Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree
that each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may delegate any
of its respective duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates. Any such
Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents and employees) which
performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be entitled to the same
benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other protective provisions to which
such Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

         10.15. Co-Agents, Documentation Agent, Syndication Agent, Etc. None of
the Lenders, if any, identified in this Agreement as a "co-agent",
"documentation agent" or "syndication agent" shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than
those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of
such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such
Lenders as it makes with respect to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
Agent in Section 10.11.

         10.16. Collateral Documents. (a) Each Lender authorizes the Collateral
Agent to enter into each of the Collateral Documents to which it is a party and
to take all action contemplated by such documents. Each Lender agrees that no
Holder of Secured Obligations (other than the Collateral Agent) shall have the
right individually to seek to realize upon the security granted by any
Collateral Document, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Holders of Secured Obligations upon the terms of the Collateral Documents.

                  (b) In the event that any Collateral is hereafter pledged by
any Person as collateral security for the Secured Obligations, the Collateral
Agent is hereby authorized to execute and deliver on behalf of the Holders of
Secured Obligations any Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to grant and
perfect a Lien on such Collateral in favor of the Collateral Agent on behalf of
the Holders of Secured Obligations.

                  (c) The Lenders hereby authorize the Collateral Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the

                                       94
<PAGE>

Collateral Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Revolving Loan
Commitments, LC Commitments, Term Loan B Commitments and payment and
satisfaction of all of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnity
obligations and Rate Management Obligations) at any time arising under or in
respect of this Agreement or the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby; (ii) as permitted by, but only in accordance with, the terms
of the applicable Loan Document; or (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in
writing by the Required Lenders, unless such release is required to be approved
by all of the Lenders hereunder. Upon request by the Collateral Agent at any
time, the Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agent's authority to
release particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 10.16.

                  (d) Upon any sale or transfer of assets constituting
Collateral which is permitted pursuant to the terms of any Loan Document, or
consented to in writing by the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, as
applicable, and upon at least five Business Days' prior written request by the
Borrower to the Collateral Agent, the Collateral Agent shall (and is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents as may be
necessary to evidence the release of the Liens granted to the Collateral Agent
for the benefit of the Holders of Secured Obligations herein or pursuant hereto
upon the Collateral that was sold or transferred; provided, however, that (i)
the Collateral Agent shall not be required to execute any such document on terms
which, in the Collateral Agent's opinion, would expose the Collateral Agent to
liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other than the
release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such release shall
not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Secured Obligations or any
Liens upon (or obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of) all
interests retained by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, including (without
limitation) the proceeds of the sale, all of which shall continue to constitute
part of the Collateral.

         10.17. Supplemental Collateral Agent. Anything contained herein or in
the Collateral Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, the Administrative
Agent may from time to time, when the Administrative Agent deems it necessary,
appoint one or more trustees, co-trustees, collateral co-agents or collateral
subagents (each a "Supplemental Collateral Agent") with respect to all or any
part of the Real Property Collateral. In the event that the Administrative Agent
so appoints any Supplemental Collateral Agent with respect to any Real Property
Collateral, (i) such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall automatically be
vested, in addition to the Administrative Agent, with all rights, powers,
privileges, interests and remedies of the Administrative Agent under the
Collateral Documents with respect to such Real Property Collateral; (ii) such
Supplemental Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be an "Agent" for purposes of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of Section 9.1
of the Security Agreement, this Article and Section 9.6 hereof that refer to the
Agents (or either of them) shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental
Collateral Agent, and all references therein and in the other Loan Documents to

                                       95
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to be references to the Administrative
Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as the context may require; and
(iii) the term "Administrative Agent," when used herein or in any applicable
Collateral Document in relation to the Liens on or security interests in such
Real Property Collateral granted in favor of the Administrative Agent, and any
rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Administrative Agent
with respect to such Real Property Collateral, shall be deemed to include such
Supplemental Collateral Agent; provided, however, that no such Supplemental
Collateral Agent shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any such
Real Property Collateral unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in
writing by the Administrative Agent. Should any instrument in writing from the
Borrower or any other Credit Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral
Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agent to more fully or certainly vest
in and confirming to such Supplemental Collateral Agent such rights, powers,
privileges and duties, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such Credit Party to,
execute, acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon
request by the Administrative Agent. If any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or
successor thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed,
all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent, to the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in and be
exercised by the Administrative Agent until the appointment of a new
Supplemental Collateral Agent.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1. Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any other Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all
account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or
any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may
be offset and applied toward the payment of the Secured Obligations owing to
such Lender, whether or not the Secured Obligations, or any part thereof, shall
then be due.

         11.2. Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or otherwise,
has payment made to it upon its Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure or its
Term B Loans (other than payments received pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or
3.5) in a greater proportion than that received by any other Lender, such Lender
agrees, promptly upon demand, to purchase a participation in the Aggregate
Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure and Term B Loans held by the other Lenders
so that after such purchase each Lender will hold its Pro Rata Share, Revolving
Loan Pro Rata Share and Term Loan Pro Rata Share. If any Lender, whether in
connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or otherwise,
receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such amounts
which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the benefits of such
collateral ratably in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares. In case
any such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate
further adjustments shall be made.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

         12.1. Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower shall not have the right to
assign its rights or obligations under the Loan Documents without the prior

                                       96
<PAGE>

written consent of each Lender, (ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made
in compliance with Section 12.3, and (iii) any transfer by Participation must be
made in compliance with Section 12.2. Any attempted assignment or transfer by
any party not made in compliance with this Section 12.1 shall be null and void,
unless such attempted assignment or transfer is treated as a participation in
accordance with Section 12.3.2. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
clause (ii) of this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and this
Section 12.1 does not prohibit assignments creating security interests,
including, without limitation, (x) any pledge or assignment by any Lender of all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note to a Federal
Reserve Bank, (y) in the case of a Lender which is a Fund, any pledge or
assignment of all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and any Note
to its trustee in support of its obligations to its trustee or (z) any pledge or
assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement and any Note to direct or indirect contractual counterparties in swap
agreements relating to the Loans; provided, however, that no such pledge or
assignment creating a security interest shall release the transferor Lender from
its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties thereto have complied
with the provisions of Section 12.3. The Administrative Agent may treat the
Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may in its discretion (but
shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to
another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loan or any Note agrees by
acceptance of such assignment to be bound by all the terms and provisions of the
Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any Person, who at the time
of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of the
rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been issued in evidence thereof),
shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder or assignee of the
rights to such Loan.

         12.2. Participations.

                  12.2.1 Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may at any
         time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
         participating interests in any Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure of
         such Lender, any Term B Loans of such Lender, any Note held by such
         Lender, any Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender or any other
         interest of such Lender under the Loan Documents. In the event of any
         such sale by a Lender of participating interests to a Participant, such
         Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain unchanged,
         such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto
         for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain the
         owner of its Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure and Term B Loans and
         the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence thereof for all
         purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the Borrower
         under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
         such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Administrative
         Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under the Loan
         Documents.

                  12.2.2 Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole right
         to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,

                                       97
<PAGE>

         modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other
         than any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Credit
         Extension or Revolving Loan Commitment in which such Participant has an
         interest which would require consent of all of the Lenders or all of
         the Lenders directly affected thereby pursuant to the terms of Section
         8.2 or of any other Loan Document.

                  12.2.3 Benefit of Certain Provisions. The Borrower agrees that
         each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided
         in Section 11.1 in respect of its participating interest in amounts
         owing under the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the amount of
         its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under
         the Loan Documents, provided that each Lender shall retain the right of
         setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to the amount of
         participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders agree to
         share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
         right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each
         Lender, any amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of
         setoff, such amounts to be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if
         each Participant were a Lender. The Borrower further agrees that each
         Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4
         and 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
         interest by assignment pursuant to Section 12.3, provided that (i) a
         Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
         Section 3.1, 3.2 or 3.5 than the Lender who sold the participating
         interest to such Participant would have received had it retained such
         interest for its own account, unless the sale of such interest to such
         Participant is made with the prior written consent of the Borrower, and
         (ii) any Participant not incorporated under the laws of the United
         States of America or any State thereof agrees to comply with the
         provisions of Section 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender.

         12.3. Assignments.

                  12.3.1 Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may at any time
         assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any
         part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such
         assignment shall be evidenced by an agreement substantially in the form
         of Exhibit C or in such other form as may be agreed to by the parties
         thereto (each such agreement, an "Assignment Agreement"). Each such
         assignment with respect to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an
         Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund shall either be in an amount
         equal to the entire applicable Revolving Loan Commitment, LC
         Commitment, Term Loan B Commitment and Outstanding Revolving Credit
         Exposure and/or Term B Loans, as applicable, of the assigning Lender or
         (unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
         consents) be in an aggregate amount not less than $1,000,000 (with
         contemporaneous assignments to Approved Funds of a single Lender being
         treated as one assignment for purposes of such minimum amount). The
         amount of the assignment shall be based on the Revolving Loan
         Commitment, LC Commitment, Term Loan B Commitment, Outstanding
         Revolving Credit Exposure (if the Revolving Loan Commitment has been
         terminated) and/or outstanding Term B Loans (if the Term Loan B
         Commitment has been terminated), as applicable, subject to the
         assignment, determined as of the date of such assignment or as of the
         "Trade Date," if the "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment
         Agreement.

                  12.3.2 Consents. The consent of the Borrower shall be required
         prior to an assignment becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a
         Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, provided that the
         consent of the Borrower shall not be required if (i) a Default has
         occurred and is continuing, (ii) if such assignment is in connection
         with the physical settlement of any Lender's obligations to direct or
         indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements relating to the
         Loans or (iii) if such assignment is made in connection with the
         primary syndication of the loans and commitments hereunder. The consent
         of the Administrative Agent shall be required prior to an assignment
         becoming effective unless the Purchaser is a Lender, an Affiliate of a
         Lender or an Approved Fund. The consent of each of the LC Issuers shall
         be required prior to an assignment of any Revolving Loan Commitment any
         LC Commitment or Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure becoming
         effective. Any consent required under this Section 12.3.2 shall not be
         unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  12.3.3 Effect; Effective Date. Upon delivery to the
         Administrative Agent of an Assignment Agreement, together with any
         consents required by Sections 12.3.1 and 12.3.2, such assignment shall
         become effective as of the effective date specified in such assignment
         after recordation of such assignment by the Administrative Agent in the
         Register pursuant to Section 12.3.4. The Assignment Agreement shall
         contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of
         the consideration used to make the purchase of the Revolving Loan
         Commitment, LC Commitment and Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure
         and/or Term B Loans, as applicable, under the applicable Assignment
         Agreement constitutes "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and that the
         rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents
         will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date
         of such assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender
         party to this Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on
         behalf of the Lenders and shall have all the rights and obligations of
         a Lender under the Loan Documents, to the same extent as if it were an
         original party thereto, and the transferor Lender shall be released
         with respect to the Revolving Loan Commitment, LC Commitment and
         Outstanding Revolving Credit Exposure and/or Term B Loans, as
         applicable, assigned to such Purchaser without any further consent or
         action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Administrative Agent. In the
         case of an assignment covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
         Lender hereunder but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of,
         and subject to, those provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents which survive payment of the Obligations and termination of
         the applicable agreement. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
         rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with
         this Section 12.3 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
         sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
         in accordance with Section 12.2. Upon the consummation of any
         assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.3, the
         transferor Lender, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall, if
         the transferor Lender or the Purchaser desires that its Loans be
         evidenced by Notes, make appropriate arrangements so that new Notes or,
         as appropriate, replacement Notes are issued to such transferor Lender,
         if applicable, and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes, are
         issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting
         their respective Revolving Loan Commitments (or, if the Revolving Loan

                                       99
<PAGE>

         Termination Date has occurred, their respective Outstanding Revolving
         Credit Exposure) or Term Loan B Commitments (or, if the Term Loan B
         Commitments have been terminated, outstanding Term B Loans), as
         applicable, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment.

                  12.3.4 Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for
         this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each
         Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the recordation
         of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Revolving Loan
         Commitments of, LC Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Credit
         Extensions owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time
         to time (the "Register") and shall record in the Register each
         assignment pursuant to each Assignment Agreement delivered to it. The
         entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
         Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name
         is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
         hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to
         the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
         Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time
         upon reasonable prior notice.

                  12.3.5 Borrower Increased Costs. Notwithstanding any other
         provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if solely and directly as
         a result of any assignment or transfer effected by a Lender under this
         Agreement, there arises or will arise any obligation on the part of the
         Borrower under Article III of this Agreement to pay any sum in excess
         of the sum (if any) which, but for such assignment or transfer, it
         would have been obliged to pay to such Lender as an additional amount
         under Article III, the Borrower shall not be obliged to pay such
         excess.

         12.4. Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each Lender
to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring an
interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and any
prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided that each
Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.11 of this
Agreement.

         12.5. Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause such
Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply with
the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

                           number) set forth in its Administrative
                           Questionnaire.

         certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when
         received; notices sent by telecopier shall be deemed to have been given

         13.1.2 below, shall be effective as provided in said Section 13.1.2.

                  13.1.2 Electronic Communications. Notices and other

         and internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by
         the Administrative Agent or as otherwise determined by the
         Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to
         notices to any Lender or any LC Issuer pursuant to Article II if such
         Lender or such LC Issuer, as applicable, has notified the
         Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under
         such Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or
         the Borrower may, in its respective discretion, agree to accept notices
         and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications
         pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise determines,
         provided that such determination or approval may be limited to

counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
shall constitute a single contract. Except as provided in Article IV, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Initial LC Issuers and the Lenders and
when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which,
when taken together, bear the signatures of each of such parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart

National Commerce Act, or any other state laws based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act.

Total Leverage Ratio is less than 3.0 to 1.0.

         "Level II Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the

Ratio is less than 3.5 to 1.0.

         "Level III Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the
fiscal quarter of the Borrower referred to in the most recent Financials, (i)
the Borrower has not qualified for Level I Status or Level II Status and (ii)
the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 4.0 to 1.0.

         "Level IV Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the
fiscal quarter of the Borrower referred to in the most recent Financials, the

         "Status" means (x) either Level I Status, Level II Status, Level III

         "Term Level I Status" exists at any date if, as of the last day of the

                                   LITIGATION

Headwaters:

1.       Boynton, et al v. Headwaters, Inc. et al, U.S. Dist. Ct. W.D. Tenn.,
         Civ. No. 1-02-1111, filed 2002.

         In October 1998, Headwaters entered into a technology purchase
         agreement with James G. Davidson and Adtech, Inc. The transaction
         transferred certain patent and royalty rights to Headwaters related to
         a synthetic fuel technology invented by Davidson. (This technology is
         distinct from the technology developed by Headwaters.) This action is
         factually related to an earlier action brought by certain purported
         officers and directors of Adtech, Inc. That action was dismissed by the
         United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee and
         the District Court's order of dismissal was affirmed on appeal. In the
         current action, the allegations arise from the same facts, but the
         claims are asserted by certain purported stockholders of Adtech. In
         June 2002, Headwaters received a summons and complaint from the United
         States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee alleging,
         among other things, fraud, conspiracy, constructive trust, conversion,
         patent infringement and interference with contract arising out of the
         1998 technology purchase agreement entered into between Davidson and
         Adtech on the one hand, and Headwaters on the other. The complaint
         seeks declaratory relief and compensatory damages in the approximate
         amount of $10 million and punitive damages. The District Court has
         dismissed all claims against Headwaters except conspiracy and
         constructive trust. The case is set for trial in November 2004.

2.       AGTC v. Headwaters Incorporated, American Arbitration Association, Salt
         Lake City, Utah, No. 81 181 031 02, filed 2002.

         In March 1996, Headwaters entered into an agreement with AGTC and its
         associates for certain services related to the identification and
         selection of synthetic fuel projects. In March 2002, AGTC filed an
         arbitration demand in Salt Lake City, Utah claiming that it is owed
         commissions under the 1996 agreement for 8% of the revenues received by
         Headwaters from the Port Hodder project. AGTC claims approximate
         damages in a range between $520,000 and $14,000,000. Headwaters asserts
         that AGTC did not perform under the agreement and that the agreement
         was terminated and the disputes were settled in July 1996. Headwaters
         has filed an answer in the arbitration, denying AGTC's claims and has
         asserted counterclaims against AGTC. In July and August 2004, the
         arbitrator held hearings. The arbitrator has asked the parties for
         post-hearing briefs and proposed findings and conclusions.

3.       Headwaters Incorporated v. AJG Financial Services, Inc., Fourth Dist.
         Ct., State of Utah, Civ. No. 000403381, filed 2000.

                                       3
<PAGE>

         In December 1996, Headwaters entered into a technology license and
         proprietary chemical reagent sale agreement with AJG Financial
         Services, Inc. The agreement called for AJG to pay royalties and to
         purchase proprietary chemical reagent material from Headwaters. In
         October 2000, Headwaters filed a complaint in the Fourth District Court
         for the State of Utah against AJG alleging that it had failed to make
         payments and to perform other obligations under the agreement.
         Headwaters asserts claims including breach of contract, declaratory
         judgment, unjust enrichment and accounting and seeks money damages as
         well as other relief. AJG's answer to the complaint denies Headwaters'
         claims and asserted counterclaims based upon allegations of
         misrepresentation and breach of contract. AJG seeks compensatory
         damages in the approximate amount of $71 million and punitive damages.
         Headwaters denies the allegations of AJG's counterclaims. The case is
         set for trial in January 2005.

4.       EEOC and Chavez et al v. Eldorado Stone, LLC, U.S. Dist. Ct. W.D.
         Wash., Civ. No. CV03-2768P, filed 2003.

         In September 2003, the EEOC filed a complaint in the Federal District
         Court for the Western District of Washington against Eldorado Stone,
         LLC, an affiliated company, and certain individuals alleging sexual
         harassment, retaliation, and constructive discharge in violation of the
         Civil Rights Act, arising out of the operations at a Carnation,
         Washington facility. Six individual former employees joined the lawsuit
         alleging multiple related causes of action. Plaintiffs pray for
         injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.
         Eldorado Stone has filed answers to the complaints, denying liability
         and damages. Plaintiffs have not provided a damages calculation, but
         estimates range between $500,000 and $1,000,000.

5.       McEwan v. Headwaters Incorporated, Fourth Dist. Ct., State of Utah,
         Civ. No. 040401670, filed 2004.

         In 1995, Headwaters granted stock options to a member of its board of
         directors, Lloyd , McEwan. The director resigned from the board in
         1996. Headwaters has declined McEwan's attempts to exercise most of the
         options on grounds that the options terminated. In May 2004, McEwan
         filed a complaint in the Fourth District Court for the State of Utah
         against Headwaters alleging breach of contract, breach of implied
         covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraud, and misrepresentation.
         McEwan seeks declaratory relief as well as compensatory damages in the
         approximate amount of $2,000,000 and punitive damages. Headwaters has
         filed an answer denying McEwan's claims and has asserted counterclaims
         against McEwan. McEwan denies the counterclaims.

1.       Eason Associates Sales Company, Inc. vs. Darin Lee Watson, Evergreene
         Marketing, Inc., John D. Greene, and Franklin Murray Hyatt, North
         Carolina Superior Court, Columbus County, Division Case No. 03CV01428.

         Eason Associate Sales Company, Inc. ("Eason"), a company which formerly
         provided sales representatives to Tapco International Corporation
         ("Tapco International"), filed a claim on November 3, 2003 against two
         former Tapco International individual sales representatives, John D.
         Greene and Franklin Murray Hyatt, seeking compensatory damages in
         excess of $10,000 and punitive damages. Although Tapco International is
         not a named defendant in the suit, Tapco International has an oral
         indemnification agreement with Mr. Greene and Mr. Hyatt and has,
         consequently, undertaken their defense. Although the suit is still
         ongoing, Tapco International believes that the General Release obtained
         from Eason pursuant to settlement of an earlier related lawsuit filed
         by Eason against Tapco International bars this second lawsuit.

2.       Richard Grubola vs. Tapco International Corporation, Wayne County
         Circuit Court, State of Michigan, Case No. 03-318496NZ.

         On June 9, 2003, Richard Grubola, an employee of Tapco International
         who was terminated in 2002, filed an age discrimination complaint.
         Although the claims was denied by the EEOC on March 10, 2003, the
         matter is still ongoing. Mr. Grubola claims compensatory damages in the
         amount of $25,000, exemplary damages in the amount of $25,000 and lost
         wages and benefits, past and future. Tapco International maintains that
         the decision to terminate Mr. Grubola was performance-related.

3.       Dinesol Building Products, Ltd. vs. Tapco International, Inc., U.S.
         District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, Case No. 4:04 CV
         0185.

         This litigation involves claims and counterclaims for both patent
         infringement and trade dress claims in connection with certain vent,
         block and shutter products. While the patent infringement claims were
         settled in June 2004 pursuant to a settlement agreement under which
         Dinesold Building Products, Ltd. agreed to change its design, the trade
         dress claims are currently being litigated.

5.       Pamela Darling vs. Tapco International Corporation, Michigan Department
         of Civil Rights, Complaint/Charge No. 316048, EEOC 23AA400557C.

         Pamela Darling, a current employee of Tapco International, filed a
         claim of age, gender and disability discrimination against her
         employer. No specific amount of damages have been claimed. On January
         20, 2004, the State of Michigan Department of Civil Rights sent Tapco
         International a notice requesting a response to interrogatories and a
         statement of position with regard to the complaint. Tapco responded to
         this request in a letter dated February 17, 2004. In this letter, Tapco
         International states that no adverse employment action has been taken
         against Ms. Darling and requests that the charge be dismissed with a
         finding of no probable cause.

6.       Metamora

         There is historical contamination at the 4057 South Oak Street,
         Metamora, MI property, which has been the subject of several
         investigations. Initially, the site was targeted for investigation due
         to a disgruntled former employee's 1991 report of illegal disposal of
         hazardous waste drums in a pond on the property that has since been
         filled. Subsequent investigation discredited the employee's claims but
         did turn up modest levels of contaminants at the site. A No Further
         Action ("NFA") letter from the Michigan Department of Environmental
         Quality has been requested. There are presently no estimates of amounts
         of remediation should remediation eventually be required.

         Indebtedness may at any time require in order to prove and realize upon
         any rights or claims pertaining to the Subordinated Indebtedness and to
         effectuate the full benefit of the subordination contained herein; and
         upon failure of the holder(s) of this Note so to do, any such holder of

         extension, renewal, restatement or replacement of, increase in or
         addition or supplement to any of the Senior Indebtedness or any
         instrument or agreement relating thereto, (ii) any exercise or
         nonexercise of any right, power or remedy under or in respect of any of
         the Senior Indebtedness or any instrument or agreement relating thereto

         whether or not any holder(s) of this Note shall have had notice or
         knowledge of any of the foregoing;

                  (g) the foregoing provisions are solely for the purpose of
         defining the relative rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness
         on the one hand, and the holder(s) of this Note on the other hand, and
         nothing herein shall impair, as between any Loan Party and the
         holder(s) of this Note, the obligation of such Loan Party which is

         prevent the holder(s) of this Note from exercising all remedies
         otherwise permitted by applicable law or under this Note, subject in
         all events to the rights of the holders of the Senior Indebtedness as
         herein provided for; and

         (h) the provisions of this sixth paragraph of this Note (i) may not be
amended without the prior written consent of each holder of Senior Indebtedness,

         I. such other documents as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the
         opinions we express below.

On the basis of the assumptions and subject to the qualifications and
limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1. (a) The Company is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under Delaware General Corporation Law and has the corporate power to own and
hold under lease the properties it purports to own and hold under lease and to
conduct the business in which it is engaged.

                  (b) The Company has the corporate power to execute and
         deliver, and to perform its obligations under the Agreement, the
         Delivered Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral
         Agreements and for the Company's incurrence of the indebtedness in the
         amount of the Aggregate Revolving Loan Commitment and the Aggregate
         Term B Loan Commitment (as in effect on the date hereof) and the
         repayment of such indebtedness, with interest, in accordance with the
         terms of the Agreement, and for the grant by the Company of the
         security interest in its Collateral described in Section 1.2 of the
         Pledge and Security Agreement.

                  (c) Each California Guarantor is duly incorporated, validly
         existing and in good standing under the law of California and has the
         corporate power to own and hold under lease the properties it purports
         to own and hold under lease and to conduct the business in which it is
         engaged.

<PAGE>

                  (d) Each Texas Guarantor is duly incorporated, validly
         existing and in good standing under the law of Texas and has the
         corporate power to own and hold under lease the properties it purports
         to own and hold under lease and to conduct the business in which it is
         engaged.

                  (e) Each California and Texas Guarantor has the corporate
         power to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, the
         Guaranty and for the grant by such Guarantor of the security interest
         in its Collateral described in Section 1.2 of the Pledge and Security
         Agreement.

2. Each of the Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Collateral
Agreements constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Company, and
each Delivered Note will, upon disbursement of the loans evidenced by such Note,
constitute a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company, in each case
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

3. Each of the Guaranty and the Collateral Agreements (a) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by each of the Texas and California
Guarantors and (b) constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of each
Guarantor, in each case enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance with
its terms.

4. The execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations under,
the Agreement, the Delivered Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Collateral Agreements by the Company do not and will not violate or conflict
with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or result in the
creation of any Lien upon any property of the Company under, the federal law of
the United States of America ("Federal Law") or the law of the State.

5. The execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations under,
the Guaranty and the Collateral Agreements by each Guarantor do not and will not
violate or conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any property of such Guarantor under,
Federal Law or the law of the State or, in the case of the California
Guarantors, the law of California or, in the case of the Texas Guarantors, the
law of Texas.

6. Under Federal Law and the law of the State and, in the case of the California
Guarantors, the law of California and, in the case of the Texas Guarantors, the
law of Texas, no Governmental Approvals are required to have been obtained, and
no Governmental Registrations are required to have been made:

                  (a) by the Company, (i) for the valid execution and delivery
         by the Company of the Agreement, the Delivered Notes, the Intercreditor
         Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, (ii) for the Company's
         incurrence of the indebtedness in the amount of the Aggregate Revolving
         Loan Commitment and the Aggregate Term B Loan Commitment (as in effect

                                       51
<PAGE>

         on the date hereof) and the repayment of such indebtedness, with
         interest, in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, or (iii) for
         the grant by the Company of the security interest in its Collateral
         described in Section 1.2 of the Pledge and Security Agreement (such
         security interests, collectively, the "Company Security Interests"); or

                  (b) by any Guarantor, (i) for the valid execution and delivery
         by such Guarantor of the Guaranty or the Collateral Agreements, or (ii)
         for the grant by such Guarantor of the security interest in its
         Collateral described in Section 1.2 of the Pledge and Security
         Agreement (such security interests, collectively, the "Guarantor
         Security Interests" and, together with the Company Security Interests,
         the "Security Interests").

7. (a) Each of the Security Interests is an enforceable security interest in the
collateral to which it applies.

                  (b) (i) If financing statements in the form attached hereto as
         Schedule 1A through Schedule 1M are communicated to the Delaware
         Secretary of State by a method of document delivery authorized under
         Section 106 of the Administrative Rules of the Delaware Secretary of
         State and an amount equal to the applicable filing fee is tendered to
         such filing office, such filing office will have an obligation to
         accept such financing statements.

                           (ii) Upon acceptance of such financing statements by
                  said filing office, the Company Security Interests and
                  Guarantor Security Interests granted by the Delaware Guarantor
                  in so much of the Collateral as consists of (in each case as
                  defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) accounts (other than
                  accounts described in Section 9-102(a)(6)(B) of the Uniform
                  Commercial Code), general intangibles, goods, chattel paper,
                  investment property, negotiable documents and instruments will
                  be perfected.

                           (iii) Such financing statements are all of the
                  filings, and are in the form, required to effect such
                  perfection.

                           (iv) Except for the filings and fees referred to in
                  clause (i), no other action, including the payment of any
                  recording or other taxes or fees, is required by law to effect
                  such perfection.

                  (c) (i) If financing statements in the form attached hereto as

8. To our knowledge, neither the Company nor any Guarantor is a party in any
action, suit or proceeding in which the pleadings request as relief that (a) any
of the obligations of the Company, or any of the rights of the Administrative
Agent, the LC Issuer or the Lenders, under the Agreement, the Delivered Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Collateral Agreements, or (b) any of the
obligations of any Guarantor, or any of the rights of the Administrative Agent,
the LC issuer or the Lenders, under the Guaranty or the Collateral Agreements,
be declared invalid or subordinated or their performance be enjoined.

Our opinion is subject to the following qualifications and limitations:

                    1. Our opinion is subject to the effect of (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance and other similar
laws affecting creditors' rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles,
(iii) requirements of reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and (iv)
additionally in the case of (A) indemnities, a requirement that facts, known to
the indemnitee but not the indemnitor, in existence at the time the indemnity
becomes effective that would entitle the indemnitee to indemnification be
disclosed to the indemnitor, (B) waivers, Sections 9-602 and 9-603 of the
Uniform Commercial Code, (C) indemnities, waivers and exculpatory provisions,
public policy and (D) restrictions on, or remedies in the event of, assignment
or transfer of rights or interests or the creation, attachment, perfection or
enforcement of security interests, Sections 9-401(b), 9-406, 9-407, 9-408 and
9-409 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Our opinion with respect to the Guaranty
is subject to the further qualification that the Guarantor may be exonerated as
to a guaranteed party if such guaranteed party fails to inform the Guarantor of
material, adverse information, known to it and not to the Guarantor, concerning
the Company or any Collateral.

                    2. The opinions expressed in paragraphs 1(a), 1(c) and 1(d)
as to the due incorporation, valid existence and good standing of the Company,
the California Guarantors and the Texas Guarantors, respectively, are based on
recent good standing certificates and verbal confirmations of good standing as
of September 7, 2004.

                    3. Certain remedial provisions of the Loan Documents as to
which we are opining may be unenforceable in whole or in part, but the inclusion
of such provisions does not affect the validity of the balance of such Loan
Documents, and the practical realization of the benefits created by such Loan
Documents taken as a whole will not be materially impaired by the
unenforceability of those particular provisions. In addition, certain remedial
provisions of such Loan Documents may be subject to procedural requirements not
set forth therein.

                    4. The Security Interests (i) will not be enforceable with
respect to, or attach to, any Collateral until value has been given and the
Grantor thereof has rights in such Collateral or (ii) be enforceable with
respect to any Collateral (other than the Securities that are the subject of our
opinion in paragraph 7(e)) against the competing interests of those third
parties (other than the Grantor thereof) who would, in accordance with the
provisions of Applicable Law, take free of, or have priority over, such Security
Interest in such Collateral, notwithstanding its perfection.

                                       54

                    5. Our opinion is limited to the law of the State and
Federal Law, in each case as in effect on the date hereof, except that our
opinions expressed in paragraphs 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) are limited to the Delaware
Uniform Commercial Code, the California Commercial Code and the Texas Uniform
Commercial Code, respectively, and, in each case, to Federal Law.

                    6. Our opinion is intended for the sole benefit of the
Administrative Agent, the LC Issuer and the Lenders, and their permitted
successors and assignees and permitted participants in or purchasers of the
obligations of the Company under the Loan Documents and no other Person is
entitled to rely on it for any purpose without our prior written consent.

                   7. We express no opinion with respect to:

                           a. the Company's or the Guarantors' rights in, title
                  to or legal or beneficial ownership of any of the Collateral
                  or any Collateral acquired after the date hereof;

                           b. the perfection of the Security Interest in any
                  dividends or other distributions of any Securities that are
                  not the subject of our opinion in paragraph 7(e);

                           c. the priority of the Security Interests in any
                  Collateral or the effect of perfection or nonperfection of the
                  Security Interests in any Collateral of a type referred to in
                  Section 9-301(c) of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (or
                  the equivalent section of the Delaware, California or Texas
                  Uniform Commercial Code) that is not located in the State, the
                  State of California, the State of Delaware, or the State of
                  Texas, as applicable;

                           d. any Collateral that (A) is not governed by Article
                  8 or 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (and not, in the case of
                  Article 9, excluded therefrom by Section 9-109(c) or (d)) or
                  (B) is subject to a certificate of title or (C) is a
                  trademark;

                           e. Section 15.2 of the Agreement and the equivalent
                  sections in the other Loan Documents insofar as said sections
                  relate to federal courts (except as to the personal
                  jurisdiction thereof); and

                           f. the definition of Collateral contained in the
                  Pledge and Security Agreement to the extent the same purports
                  to make (A) commercial tort claims part of the Collateral by
                  using general terms such as "currently existing commercial
                  tort claims" or (B) any other assets part of the Collateral by
                  using general terms such as "any property of the Grantors", in
                  each case without further specificity; provided that the
                  foregoing shall not in any way limit our opinions in

                                       55

                  paragraphs 7(b), 7(c) and 7(d) in respect of (i) commercial
                  tort claims which are specifically listed in the definition of
                  Collateral (directly or by reference to a schedule or exhibit)
                  or (ii) any property which is specifically referenced by type
                  in the definition of Collateral.

1. We have, without independent verification, relied, with respect to factual
matters, statements and conclusions, on certificates and statements of
governmental officials and officials of the Company and the Guarantors and on

                  performance of the obligations of each Guarantor under, the
                  Guaranty and the Collateral Agreements by such Guarantor do
                  not and will not (A) require any Governmental Approval or

         pursuant to the Credit Agreements will have been advanced on or before
         the date hereof;

                  (vii) that all material factual matters, including without

         record in the real property portions of the Mortgaged Property owned by
         [Borrower/Mortgagor]; [and]

                  (ix) [**FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: that the
         portions of the Fixtures (as defined below) that are or are to become

                                    Opinions

         On the basis of such examination, our reliance upon the assumptions
contained herein and our consideration of those questions of law we considered
relevant, and subject to the limitations and qualifications in this opinion, we
are of the opinion that:

                  1. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] constitutes the legal, valid
         and binding obligation of [Borrower/Mortgagor], enforceable against
         [Borrower/Mortgagor] in accordance with its terms.

                  2. The execution and delivery of the Subject Documents, the
         performance by [Borrower/Mortgagor] of its obligations thereunder and
         the compliance with the terms and conditions thereof by
         [Borrower/Mortgagor] are not in contravention of or in conflict with
         any law, rule or regulation of the State applicable to
         [Borrower/Mortgagor].

                                       64
<PAGE>

                  3. The execution and delivery by [Borrower/Mortgagor] of the
         Subject Documents to which it is a party and the performance of
         [Borrower/Mortgagor]'s obligations thereunder do not require any
         governmental consents, approvals, authorizations, permits,
         registrations, declarations or filings or other action or any notices
         to, consents of, orders of or filings with any governmental authority
         or regulatory body of the State (including those having jurisdiction
         over the enforcement of the environmental laws of the State), except
         for the recordation of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] [** FOR MICHIGAN,
         GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: and the Fixture Filings**] in the
         respective recording offices described herein.

                  4. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] (including the
         acknowledgement, attestation, seal and witness requirements) is in
         appropriate form for recordation in the State.

                  5. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] is in proper form sufficient
         to create a valid [mortgage/deed of trust lien] in favor of Collateral
         Agent on, and to vest [Trustee and] Agent with power of sale in, such
         of the Mortgaged Property described therein that constitutes real
         property (including fixtures, to the extent the same constitute real
         property). The recordation of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] in the [**
         NAME APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE**] are the only recordation,
         filings or registrations necessary to perfect the liens on the
         Mortgaged Property created by the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] [** FOR
         MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA:, except for the filing with the
         ** NAME APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE** of the Fixture Filings
         regarding that portion of the Mortgaged Property constituting
         fixtures**]. Upon recordation of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] in the
         [** NAME APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE**], [Trustee/Collateral
         Agent] will have valid and perfected [mortgage/deed of trust liens] on
         the Mortgaged Property described therein. No other recordation, filing,
         re-recordation or re-filing is necessary in order to perfect or to
         maintain the priority of the liens created by the [Mortgages/Deeds of
         Trust].

                  6. The real property descriptions attached to the
         [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] are in form legally sufficient for the
         purpose of subjecting that portion of the Mortgaged Property that
         constitutes real property to the liens evidenced by the
         [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] [** FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH
         CAROLINA: and the Fixture Filings**].

                  7. Each [Mortgage/Deed of Trust] is in proper form sufficient
         to constitute a valid and effective fixture filing with respect to the
         Premises under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in
         the State naming [Borrower/Mortgagor] as debtor and Agent as secured
         party.

                  8. Collateral Agent is not required to qualify to transact
         business in the State nor will Collateral Agent incur any tax imposed
         by the State (including, without limitation, any tax imposed by the

                                       65
<PAGE>

         State on interest or on revenue paid in respect of the Credit
         Agreements), solely as the result of the ownership or recordation of
         the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust].

                  9. [**FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: The Fixture
         Filings are in appropriate form for recordation in the State.**]

                  10. [**FOR MICHIGAN, GEORGIA AND NORTH CAROLINA: With respect
         to that portion of the Mortgaged Property in which a security interest
         may be perfected by the recordation of a fixture filing in the State
         (the "Fixtures"), the proper place to file the Fixture Filings is in
         the [LIST APPROPRIATE COUNTY RECORDING OFFICE] (the "Filing Office"),
         and no filing or recordation in any other place is necessary under the
         UCC to perfect a security interest in the Fixtures. Upon the
         recordation of the Fixture Filings with the Filing Office, Agent will
         have a perfected security interest in the Fixtures. Subsequent to the
         recordation of the Fixture Filings in accordance with the procedures
         set forth above, no other, further or subsequent filing, recordation,
         registration, re-filing, re-recordation or re-registration of the
         Fixture Filings or any additional financing statements or any other
         instrument and no other actions will be necessary or advisable to
         perfect or continue the perfection of the lien created thereby, except
         that Article 9 of the UCC requires the recordation of continuation
         statements within the period of six (6) months prior to the expiration
         of five (5) years from the date of the original recordation or the
         recordation of any continuation statement in order to maintain the
         effectiveness each of the Fixture Filings.**]

                  11. [Except as specifically set forth on Schedule 1 hereto,
         no] [No] taxes or other charges, including, without limitation,
         intangible, documentary, stamp, mortgage, transfer or recording taxes
         or similar charges are payable to the State or to any governmental
         authority or regulatory body located therein on account of the
         execution or delivery of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust], or the
         creation of the liens and security interests thereunder, or the filing,
         recordation or registration of the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust], except
         for nominal filing or recording fees.

                                 Qualifications

The foregoing opinions are subject to the following qualifications, limitations
and exceptions:

                  1. Qualifying paragraph 1 above, the enforceability of the
         [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] and the liens created thereby may be limited
         or affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
         similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally (including, without
         limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws) and by general principles of
         equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality,
         reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible
         unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless
         of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. The
         aforesaid opinion as to enforceability of the [Mortgages/Deeds of
         Trust] is also subject to the qualification that certain provisions
         contained therein may not be enforceable, but (subject to the
         limitations set forth in the foregoing sentence) such unenforceability
         will not render the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust] invalid as a whole or
         substantially interfere with realization of the principal benefits
         and/or security provided thereby.

                  2. In rendering the opinions expressed in this opinion letter,
         we have made no examination of and express no opinion with respect to:
         (i) title to or, except as to adequacy of form, descriptions of the
         Mortgaged Property described in the [Mortgages/Deeds of Trust]; (ii)
         the nature or extent of [Borrower/Mortgagor]'s rights in, or title to,
         the Mortgaged Property; (iii) the existence or non-existence of liens,
         security interests, charges or encumbrances thereon or therein actually
         of record; or (iv) the priority of any liens on any part of the
         Mortgaged Property. We have not independently certified the existence,
         condition, location or ownership of any of the Mortgaged Property.

This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any obligation to
update this opinion letter for events occurring after the date of this opinion
letter. The foregoing opinion applies only with respect to the laws of the State
and the federal laws of the United States of America and we express no opinion
with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction.

This opinion is rendered only to Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and
the Lenders and their respective successors and assigns (including any
participant in any Secured Party's interest) and is solely for their benefit in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Subject Documents and may
not be relied upon by Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent or any Lender or
any of their respective successors or assigns for any other purpose without our
prior written consent.

                                           Very truly yours,

                    WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND COVENANTS

         Grantor warrants, represents and covenants to Beneficiary as follows:

         SECTION 3.1 Title to Mortgaged Property and Lien of this Instrument.
Grantor owns the Mortgaged Property free and clear of any liens, claims or
interests, except the Permitted Encumbrances and the Permitted Liens. This Deed
of Trust creates valid, enforceable first priority liens and security interests
against the Mortgaged Property.

         SECTION 3.2 First Lien Status. Grantor shall preserve and protect the
first lien and security interest status of this Deed of Trust and the other Loan
Documents. If any lien or security interest other than a Permitted Encumbrance
or a Permitted Lien is asserted against the Mortgaged Property, Grantor shall
promptly, and at its expense, (a) give Beneficiary a detailed written notice of
such lien or security interest (including origin, amount and other terms), and
(b) pay the underlying claim in full or take such other action so as to cause it
to be released or contest the same in compliance with the requirements of the
Credit Agreement (including the requirement of providing a bond or other
security satisfactory to Beneficiary).

         SECTION 3.3 Payment and Performance. Grantor shall pay the Indebtedness
when due under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall
perform the Obligations in full when they are required to be performed.

without the prior written consent of Beneficiary, permit any of the Fixtures or
Personalty owned or leased by Grantor to be removed at any time from the Land or

                                       3
<PAGE>

         SECTION 3.5 Inspection. Grantor shall permit Beneficiary and the other
Lender Parties and their respective agents, representatives and employees, upon
reasonable prior notice to Grantor, to inspect the Mortgaged Property and all
books and records of Grantor located thereon, and to conduct such environmental
and engineering studies as Beneficiary or the other Lender Parties may require,
provided that such inspections and studies shall not materially interfere with
the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property.

         SECTION 3.6 Other Covenants. All of the covenants in the Credit
Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and, together with covenants in
this Article 3, shall be covenants running with the Land.

         SECTION 3.7 Insurance; Condemnation Awards and Insurance Proceeds.

         (a) Insurance. Grantor shall maintain or cause to be maintained, with
financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to the
Mortgaged Property against loss or damage of the kinds customarily carried or
maintained under similar circumstances by corporations of established reputation
engaged in similar businesses. Each such policy of insurance shall name
Beneficiary as the loss payee (or, in the case of liability insurance, an
additional insured) thereunder for the ratable benefit of the Lender Parties,
shall (except in the case of liability insurance) name Beneficiary as the
"mortgagee" under a so-called "New York" long form non-contributory endorsement
and shall provide for at least 30 days' prior written notice of any material
modification or cancellation of such policy. In addition to the foregoing, if
any portion of the Mortgaged Property is located in an area identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency as an area having special flood hazards and
in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 (or any amendment or successor act thereto), then Grantor
shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, with a financially sound and
reputable insurer, flood insurance in an amount sufficient to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to such Act.

                  (b) Condemnation Awards. Grantor assigns all Condemnation
Awards to Beneficiary and authorizes Beneficiary to collect and receive such
Condemnation Awards and to give proper receipts and acquittances therefor,
subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation,
Section 2.2(b) thereof).

                  (c) Insurance Proceeds. Grantor assigns to Beneficiary all
proceeds of any insurance policies insuring against loss or damage to the
Mortgaged Property. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement (including,
without limitation, Section 2.2(b) thereof), Grantor authorizes Beneficiary to
collect and receive such proceeds and authorizes and directs the issuer of each
of such insurance policies to make payment for all such losses directly to
Beneficiary, instead of to Grantor and Beneficiary jointly.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                             [Intentionally Omitted]

                                    ARTICLE 5
                             DEFAULT AND FORECLOSURE

         SECTION 5.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, Beneficiary may, at Beneficiary's election and by or
through Trustee or otherwise, exercise any or all of the following rights,
remedies and recourses:

         (a) Acceleration. Subject to any provisions of the Loan Documents
providing for the automatic acceleration of the Indebtedness upon the occurrence
of certain Events of Default, declare the Indebtedness to be immediately due and
payable, without further notice, presentment, protest, notice of intent to
accelerate, notice of acceleration, demand or action of any nature whatsoever
(each of which hereby is expressly waived by Grantor), whereupon the same shall
become immediately due and payable.

         (b) Entry on Mortgaged Property. Enter the Mortgaged Property and take
exclusive possession thereof and of all books, records and accounts relating
thereto or located thereon. If Grantor remains in possession of the Mortgaged
Property following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and without Beneficiary's prior written consent, Beneficiary may invoke
any legal remedies to dispossess Grantor.

         (c) Operation of Mortgaged Property. Hold, lease, develop, manage,
operate or otherwise use the Mortgaged Property upon such terms and conditions
as Beneficiary may deem reasonable under the circumstances (making such repairs,
alterations, additions and improvements and taking other actions, from time to
time, as Beneficiary deems necessary or desirable), and apply all Rents and
other amounts collected by Trustee or Beneficiary in connection therewith in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7.

         (d) Foreclosure and Sale. Institute proceedings for the complete
foreclosure of this Deed of Trust by judicial action or by power of sale, in
which case the Mortgaged Property may be sold for cash or credit in one or more
parcels as Beneficiary may determine. With respect to any notices required or
permitted under the UCC, Grantor agrees that ten (10) days' prior written notice
shall be deemed commercially reasonable. At any such sale by virtue of any
judicial proceedings, power of sale, or any other legal right, remedy or
recourse, the title to and right of possession of any such property shall pass
to the purchaser thereof, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantor
shall be completely and irrevocably divested of all of its right, title,
interest, claim, equity, equity of redemption, and demand whatsoever, either at
law or in equity, in and to the property sold and such sale shall be a perpetual
bar both at law and in equity against Grantor, and against all other Persons
claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof, by, through or under
Grantor. Beneficiary or any of the other Lender Parties may be a purchaser at
such sale. If Beneficiary or such other Lender Party is the highest bidder,
Beneficiary or such other Lender Party may credit the portion of the purchase
price that would be distributed to Beneficiary or such other Lender Party
against the Indebtedness in lieu of paying cash. In the event this Deed of Trust
is foreclosed by judicial action, appraisement of the Mortgaged Property is
waived.

         (e) Receiver. Make application to a court of competent jurisdiction
for, and obtain from such court as a matter of strict right and without notice
to Grantor or regard to the adequacy of the Mortgaged Property for the repayment
of the Indebtedness, the appointment of a receiver of the Mortgaged Property,
and Grantor irrevocably consents to such appointment. Any such receiver shall
have all the usual powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including
the full power to rent, maintain and otherwise operate the Mortgaged Property
upon such terms as may be approved by the court, and shall apply such Rents in
accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7.

                                       5
<PAGE>

         (f) Other. Exercise all other rights, remedies and recourses granted
under the Loan Documents or otherwise available at law or in equity.

         SECTION 5.2 Separate Sales. The Mortgaged Property may be sold in one
or more parcels and in such manner and order as Trustee in its sole discretion
may elect. The right of sale arising out of any Event of Default shall not be
exhausted by any one or more sales.

         SECTION 5.3 Remedies Cumulative, Concurrent and Nonexclusive. Trustee,
Beneficiary and the other Lender Parties shall have all rights, remedies and
recourses granted in the Loan Documents and available at law or equity
(including the UCC), which rights (a) shall be cumulative and concurrent, (b)
may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against Grantor or
others obligated under the Loan Documents, or against the Mortgaged Property, or
against any one or more of them, at the sole discretion of Trustee, Beneficiary
or such other Lender Party, as the case may be, (c) may be exercised as often as
occasion therefor shall arise, and the exercise or failure to exercise any of
them shall not be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other
right, remedy or recourse, and (d) are intended to be, and shall be,
nonexclusive. No action by Trustee, Beneficiary or any other Lender Party in the
enforcement of any rights, remedies or recourses under the Loan Documents or
otherwise at law or equity shall be deemed to cure any Event of Default.

         SECTION 5.4 Release of and Resort to Collateral. Beneficiary may
release, regardless of consideration and without the necessity for any notice to
or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien on the Mortgaged Property, any
part of the Mortgaged Property without, as to the remainder, in any way
impairing, affecting, subordinating or releasing the lien or security interest
created in or evidenced by the Loan Documents or their status as a first and
prior lien and security interest in and to the Mortgaged Property. For payment
of the Indebtedness, Beneficiary may resort to any other security in such order
and manner as Beneficiary may elect.

         SECTION 5.5 Waiver of Redemption, Notice and Marshalling of Assets. To
the fullest extent permitted by law, Grantor hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and releases (a) all benefit that might accrue to Grantor
by virtue of any present or future statute of limitations or law or judicial
decision exempting the Mortgaged Property from attachment, levy or sale on
execution or providing for any stay of execution, exemption from civil process,
redemption or extension of time for payment, (b) all notices of any Event of
Default or of any election by Trustee or Beneficiary to exercise or the actual
exercise of any right, remedy or recourse provided for under the Loan Documents,
and (c) any right to a marshalling of assets or a sale in inverse order of
alienation.

         SECTION 5.6 Discontinuance of Proceedings. If Trustee, Beneficiary or
any other Lender Party shall have proceeded to invoke any right, remedy or
recourse permitted under the Loan Documents and shall thereafter elect to
discontinue or abandon it for any reason, Trustee, Beneficiary or such other
Lender Party, as the case may be, shall have the unqualified right to do so and,
in such an event, Grantor, Trustee, Beneficiary and the other Lender Parties
shall be restored to their former positions with respect to the Indebtedness,

                                       6
<PAGE>

the Obligations, the Loan Documents, the Mortgaged Property and otherwise, and
the rights, remedies, recourses and powers of Trustee, Beneficiary and the other
Lender Parties shall continue as if the right, remedy or recourse had never been
invoked, but no such discontinuance or abandonment shall waive any Event of
Default which may then exist or the right of Trustee, Beneficiary or any other
Lender Party thereafter to exercise any right, remedy or recourse under the Loan
Documents for such Event of Default.

         SECTION 5.7 Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale of, and
the Rents and other amounts generated by the holding, leasing, management,
operation or other use of the Mortgaged Property, shall be applied by
Beneficiary or Trustee (or the receiver, if one is appointed) in the following
order unless otherwise required by applicable law:

         (a) to the payment of the costs and expenses of taking possession of
the Mortgaged Property and of holding, using, leasing, repairing, improving and
selling the same, including, without limitation (1) trustee's and receiver's
fees and expenses, including the repayment of the amounts evidenced by any
receiver's certificates, (2) court costs, (3) attorneys' and accountants' fees
and expenses, and (4) costs of advertisement;

         (b) he payment of the Indebtedness and performance of the Obligations
in such manner and order of preference as Beneficiary in its sole discretion may
determine; and

         (c) balance, if any, to the Persons legally entitled thereto.

         SECTION 5.8 Occupancy After Foreclosure. Any sale of the Mortgaged
Property or any part thereof in accordance with Section 5.1(d) will divest all
right, title and interest of Grantor in and to the property sold. Subject to
applicable law, any purchaser at a foreclosure sale will receive immediate
possession of the property purchased. If Grantor retains possession of such
property or any part thereof subsequent to such sale, Grantor will be considered
a tenant at sufferance of the purchaser, and will, if Grantor remains in
possession after demand to remove, be subject to eviction and removal, forcible
or otherwise, with or without process of law.

         SECTION 5.9 Additional Advances and Disbursements; Costs of
Enforcement.

         (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, Beneficiary and each of the other Lender Parties shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to cure such Event of Default in the name and on behalf
of Grantor. All sums advanced and expenses incurred at any time by Beneficiary
or any other Lender Party under this Section 5.9, or otherwise under this Deed
of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents or applicable law, shall bear
interest from the date that such sum is advanced or expense incurred, to and
including the date of reimbursement, computed at the highest rate at which
interest is then computed on any portion of the Indebtedness, and all such sums,
together with interest thereon, shall be secured by this Deed of Trust.

         (b) Grantor shall pay all expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and expenses) of or incidental to the perfection and enforcement of this
Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents, or the enforcement, compromise or
settlement of the Indebtedness or any claim under this Deed of Trust and the
other Loan Documents, and for the curing thereof, or for defending or asserting
the rights and claims of Beneficiary in respect thereof, by litigation or
otherwise.

                                       7
<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.10 No Mortgagee in Possession. Neither the enforcement of any
of the remedies under this Article 5, the assignment of the Rents and Leases
under Article 6, the security interests under Article 7, nor any other remedies
afforded to Beneficiary under the Loan Documents, at law or in equity shall
cause Trustee, Beneficiary or any other Lender Party to be deemed or construed
to be a mortgagee in possession of the Mortgaged Property, to obligate Trustee,
Beneficiary or any other Lender Party to lease the Mortgaged Property or attempt
to do so, or to take any action, incur any expense, or perform or discharge any
obligation, duty or liability whatsoever under any of the Leases or otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE 6
                         ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

         SECTION 6.1 Assignment. In furtherance of and in addition to the
assignment made by Grantor in Section 2.1 of this Deed of Trust, Grantor hereby
absolutely and unconditionally assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to Trustee
(for the benefit of Beneficiary) and to Beneficiary all of its right, title and
interest in and to all Leases, whether now existing or hereafter entered into,
and all of its right, title and interest in and to all Rents. This assignment is
an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only. So
long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Grantor shall
have a revocable license from Trustee and Beneficiary to exercise all rights
extended to the landlord under the Leases, including the right to receive and
collect all Rents and to hold the Rents in trust for use in the payment and
performance of the Obligations and to otherwise use the same. The foregoing
license is granted subject to the conditional limitation that no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, whether or not legal proceedings have
commenced, and without regard to waste, adequacy of security for the Obligations
or solvency of Grantor, the license herein granted shall automatically expire
and terminate, without notice to Grantor by Trustee or Beneficiary (any such
notice being hereby expressly waived by Grantor to the extent permitted by
applicable law).

         SECTION 6.2 Perfection Upon Recordation. Grantor acknowledges that
Beneficiary and Trustee have taken all actions necessary to obtain, and that
upon recordation of this Deed of Trust Beneficiary and Trustee shall have, to
the extent permitted under applicable law, a valid and fully perfected, first
priority, present assignment of the Rents arising out of the Leases and all
security for such Leases. Grantor acknowledges and agrees that upon recordation
of this Deed of Trust Trustee's and Beneficiary's interest in the Rents shall be
deemed to be fully perfected, "choate" and enforced as to Grantor and to the
extent permitted under applicable law, all third parties, including, without
limitation, any subsequently appointed trustee in any case under Title 11 of the
United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"), without the necessity of commencing
a foreclosure action with respect to this Deed of Trust, making formal demand
for the Rents, obtaining the appointment of a receiver or taking any other
affirmative action.

         SECTION 6.3 Bankruptcy Provisions. Without limitation of the absolute
nature of the assignment of the Rents hereunder, Grantor, Trustee and
Beneficiary agree that (a) this Deed of Trust shall constitute a "security
agreement" for purposes of Section 552(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, (b) the
security interest created by this Deed of Trust extends to property of Grantor

                                       8

acquired before the commencement of a case in bankruptcy and to all amounts paid
as Rents and (c) such security interest shall extend to all Rents acquired by
the estate after the commencement of any case in bankruptcy.

         SECTION 6.4 No Merger of Estates. So long as part of the Indebtedness
and the Obligations secured hereby remain unpaid and undischarged, the fee and
leasehold estates to the Mortgaged Property shall not merge, but shall remain
separate and distinct, notwithstanding the union of such estates either in
Grantor, Beneficiary, any tenant or any third party by purchase or otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                               SECURITY AGREEMENT

         SECTION 7.1 Security Interest. This Deed of Trust constitutes a
"security agreement" on personal property within the meaning of the UCC and
other applicable law and with respect to the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases,
Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance
and Condemnation Awards. To this end, Grantor grants to Beneficiary a first and
prior security interest in the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases, Rents, Deposit
Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance, Condemnation
Awards and all other Mortgaged Property which is personal property to secure the
payment of the Indebtedness and performance of the Obligations, and agrees that
Beneficiary shall have all the rights and remedies of a secured party under the
UCC with respect to such property. Any notice of sale, disposition or other
intended action by Beneficiary with respect to the Personalty, Fixtures, Leases,
Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds, Insurance
and Condemnation Awards sent to Grantor at least ten (10) days prior to any
action under the UCC shall constitute reasonable notice to Grantor. In the event
of any inconsistency between the terms of this Deed of Trust and the terms of
the Security Agreement with respect to the collateral covered both therein and
herein, the Security Agreement shall control and govern to the extent of any
such inconsistency.

         SECTION 7.2 Financing Statements. Grantor shall prepare and deliver to
Beneficiary such financing statements, and shall execute and deliver to
Beneficiary such other documents, instruments and further assurances, in each
case in form and substance satisfactory to Beneficiary, as Beneficiary may, from
time to time, reasonably consider necessary to create, perfect and preserve
Beneficiary's security interest hereunder. Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes
Beneficiary to cause financing statements (and amendments thereto and
continuations thereof) and any such documents, instruments and assurances to be
recorded and filed, at such times and places as may be required or permitted by
law to so create, perfect and preserve such security interest. Grantor
represents and warrants to Beneficiary that Grantor's jurisdiction of
organization is the State of [________________]. After the date of this Deed of
Trust, Grantor shall not change its name, type of organization, organizational
identification number (if any), jurisdiction of organization or location (within
the meaning of the UCC) without giving at least thirty (30) days' prior written
notice to Beneficiary.

         SECTION 7.3 Fixture Filing. This Deed of Trust shall also constitute a
"fixture filing" for the purposes of the UCC against all of the Mortgaged
Property which is or is to become fixtures. The information provided in this
Section 7.3 is provided so that this Deed of Trust shall comply with the
requirements of the UCC for a mortgage instrument to be filed as a financing

                                       9

statement. Grantor is the "Debtor" and its name and mailing address are set
forth in the preamble of this Deed of Trust immediately preceding Article 1.
Beneficiary is the "Secured Party" and its name and mailing address from which
information concerning the security interest granted herein may be obtained are
also set forth in the preamble of this Deed of Trust immediately preceding
Article 1. A statement describing the portion of the Mortgaged Property
comprising the fixtures hereby secured is set forth in Section 1.1(c) of this
Deed of Trust. Grantor represents and warrants to Beneficiary that Grantor is
the record owner of the Mortgaged Property, the employer identification number
of Grantor is [_____________] and the organizational identification number of
Grantor is [____________].

                                    ARTICLE 8
                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

         SECTION 8.1 Certain Rights. With the approval of Beneficiary, Trustee
shall have the right to select, employ and consult with counsel. Trustee shall
have the right to rely on any instrument, document or signature authorizing or
supporting any action taken or proposed to be taken by it hereunder, believed by
it in good faith to be genuine. Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement for
actual, reasonable expenses incurred by it in the performance of its duties and
to reasonable compensation for Trustee's services hereunder as shall be
rendered. Grantor shall, from time to time, pay the compensation due to Trustee
hereunder and reimburse Trustee for, and indemnify, defend and save Trustee
harmless against, all liability and reasonable expenses which may be incurred by
it in the performance of its duties, including those arising from joint,
concurrent, or comparative negligence of Trustee; provided, however, that
Grantor shall not be liable under such indemnification to the extent such
liability or expenses result solely from Trustee's gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Grantor's obligations under this Section 8.1 shall not be reduced or
impaired by principles of comparative or contributory negligence.

         SECTION 8.2 Retention of Money. All moneys received by Trustee shall,
until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes for
which they were received, but need not be segregated in any manner from any
other moneys (except to the extent required by law), and Trustee shall be under
no liability for interest on any moneys received by Trustee hereunder.

         SECTION 8.3 Successor Trustees. If Trustee or any successor Trustee
shall die, resign or become disqualified from acting in the execution of this
trust, or Beneficiary shall desire to appoint a substitute Trustee, Beneficiary
shall have full power to appoint one or more substitute Trustees and, if
preferred, several substitute Trustees in succession who shall succeed to all
the estates, rights, powers and duties of Trustee. Such appointment may be
executed by any authorized agent of Beneficiary and as so executed, such
appointment shall be conclusively presumed to be executed with authority, valid
and sufficient, without further proof of any action.

         SECTION 8.4 Perfection of Appointment. Should any deed, conveyance or
instrument of any nature be required from Grantor by any successor Trustee to
more fully and certainly vest in and confirm to such successor Trustee such
estates, rights, powers and duties, then, upon request by such Trustee, all such
deeds, conveyances and instruments shall be made, executed, acknowledged and
delivered and shall be caused to be recorded and/or filed by Grantor.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 8.5 Trustee Liability. In no event or circumstance shall
Trustee or any substitute Trustee hereunder be personally liable under or as a
result of this Deed of Trust, either as a result of any action by Trustee (or
any substitute Trustee) in the exercise of the powers hereby granted or
otherwise.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

this Deed of Trust shall be given in accordance with Section 13.1 of the Credit
Agreement.

         SECTION 9.2 Covenants Running with the Land. All Obligations contained

and shall be construed as, covenants running with the Land. As used herein,
"Grantor" shall refer to the party named in the first paragraph of this Deed of
Trust and to any subsequent owner of all or any portion of the Mortgaged
Property. All Persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Mortgaged
Property shall be deemed to have notice of, and be bound by, the terms of the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that no such
party shall be entitled to any rights thereunder without the prior written
consent of Beneficiary.

         SECTION 9.3 Attorney-in-Fact. Grantor hereby irrevocably appoints
Beneficiary as its attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest
and with full power of substitution, with full authority in the place and stead
of Grantor and in the name of Grantor or otherwise (a) to execute and/or record
any notices of completion, cessation of labor or any other notices that
Beneficiary deems appropriate to protect Beneficiary's interest, if Grantor
shall fail to do so within ten (10) days after written request by Beneficiary,
(b) upon the issuance of a deed pursuant to the foreclosure of this Deed of
Trust or the delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, to execute all
instruments of assignment, conveyance or further assurance with respect to the
Leases, Rents, Deposit Accounts, Property Agreements, Tax Refunds, Proceeds,
Insurance and Condemnation Awards in favor of the grantee of any such deed and
as may be necessary or desirable for such purpose, (c) to prepare and file or
record financing statements and continuation statements, and to prepare, execute
and file or record applications for registration and like papers necessary to
create, perfect or preserve Beneficiary's security interests and rights in or to
any of the Mortgaged Property, and (d) after the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, to perform any obligation of Grantor
hereunder; provided, however, that (1) Beneficiary shall not under any
circumstances be obligated to perform any obligation of Grantor; (2) any sums
advanced by Beneficiary in such performance shall be added to and included in
the Indebtedness and shall bear interest at the highest rate at which interest
is then computed on any portion of the Indebtedness; (3) Beneficiary as such
attorney-in-fact shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually
received by Beneficiary; and (4) Beneficiary shall not be liable to Grantor or
any other person or entity for any failure to take any action which it is
empowered to take under this Section 9.3.

         SECTION 9.4 Successors and Assigns. This Deed of Trust shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of Beneficiary, the Lender Parties, Trustee and
Grantor and their respective successors and assigns. Grantor shall not, without
the prior written consent of Beneficiary, assign any rights, duties or
obligations hereunder.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.5 No Waiver. Any failure by Beneficiary, the other Lender
Parties or Trustee to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of the Loan Documents shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of same, and Beneficiary, the other Lender Parties and Trustee shall have
the right at any time to insist upon strict performance of all of such terms,
provisions and conditions.

         SECTION 9.6 Credit Agreement. If any conflict or inconsistency exists

govern.

         SECTION 9.7 Release or Reconveyance. Upon payment in full of the
Indebtedness and performance in full of the Obligations or upon a sale or other
disposition of the Mortgaged Property permitted by the Credit Agreement,
Beneficiary, at Grantor's request and expense, shall release the liens and
security interests created by this Deed of Trust or reconvey the Mortgaged
Property to Grantor.

         SECTION 9.8 Waiver of Stay, Moratorium and Similar Rights. Grantor
agrees, to the full extent that it may lawfully do so, that it will not at any
time insist upon or plead or in any way take advantage of any stay, marshalling
of assets, extension, redemption or moratorium law now or hereafter in force and
effect so as to prevent or hinder the enforcement of the provisions of this Deed
of Trust or the Indebtedness or Obligations secured hereby, or any agreement
between Grantor and Beneficiary or any rights or remedies of Trustee,
Beneficiary or any other Lender Party.

         SECTION 9.9 Applicable Law. The provisions of this Deed of Trust
regarding the creation, perfection and enforcement of the liens and security
interests herein granted shall be governed by and construed under the laws of
the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located. All other provisions of
this Deed of Trust shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
(including, without limitation, Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law of
the State of New York).

         SECTION 9.10 Headings. The Article, Section and Subsection titles
hereof are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way alter,
modify or define, or be used in construing, the text of such Articles, Sections
or Subsections.

         SECTION 9.11 Severability. If any provision of this Deed of Trust shall
be held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void or
unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be deemed severable from and

Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between Grantor and
Beneficiary relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings between such parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. Accordingly, the Loan Documents may not be
contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements
of the parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.

         SECTION 9.13 Beneficiary as Agent; Successor Agents.

         (a) Agent has been appointed to act as Agent hereunder by the other
Lender Parties. Agent shall have the right hereunder to make demands, to give
notices, to exercise or refrain from exercising any rights, and to take or
refrain from taking any action (including, without limitation, the release or
substitution of the Mortgaged Property) in accordance with the terms of the
Credit Agreement, any related agency agreement among Agent and the other Lender
Parties (collectively, as amended, amended and restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced from time to time, the "Agency Documents") and
this Deed of Trust. Grantor and all other Persons shall be entitled to rely on
releases, waivers, consents, approvals, notifications and other acts of Agent,
without inquiry into the existence of required consents or approvals of the
Lender Parties therefor.

         (b) Beneficiary shall at all times be the same Person that is Agent
under the Agency Documents. Written notice of resignation by Agent pursuant to
the Agency Documents shall also constitute notice of resignation as Agent under
this Deed of Trust. Removal of Agent pursuant to any provision of the Agency
Documents shall also constitute removal as Agent under this Deed of Trust.
Appointment of a successor Agent pursuant to the Agency Documents shall also
constitute appointment of a successor Agent under this Deed of Trust. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent by a successor Agent under the Agency
Documents, that successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed
Agent as the Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust, and the retiring or removed
Agent shall promptly (i) assign and transfer to such successor Agent all of its
right, title and interest in and to this Deed of Trust and the Mortgaged
Property, and (ii) execute and deliver to such successor Agent such assignments
and amendments and take such other actions, as may be necessary or appropriate
in connection with the assignment to such successor Agent of the liens and
security interests created hereunder, whereupon such retiring or removed Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Deed of Trust.
After any retiring or removed Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Deed of Trust and the Agency Documents shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it under this Deed of
Trust while it was Agent hereunder.
