         Changes in the Applicable Margin shall occur on each Pricing Reset
Date; provided, however, that in the event that the financial statements
required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.4.1 or 6.4.2, as applicable, are
not delivered by the latest date permissible under Section 6.4.1 or 6.4.2, as
the case may be (the "Late Delivery Date"), and if, upon delivery of such
financial statements, it is determined that delivery of such financial
statements on the Late Delivery Date would have resulted in an increase in the

(the "Late Pricing Reset Date"), such increase will be deemed effective as of
the Late Pricing Reset Date.

                  Eurodollar Pricing Option;

                           (ii)     with respect to any other portion of the
                  Revolving Loan, the Base Rate;

         plus     (b)      an additional 2% effective on the day the Agent
                  notifies the Company that the interest rates hereunder are
                  increasing as a result of the occurrence and continuance of
                  an Event of Default until the earlier of such time as (i)
                  such Event of Default is no longer continuing or (ii) such
                  Event of Default is deemed no longer to exist, in each case
                  pursuant to Section 8.3.

         1.11.    "Approved Contingent Debt" means contingent obligations under

         withheld); and

                  (b)      up to $20,000,000 of debt that is subordinated to

         under this Section 2.1.1 at any one time outstanding plus the
         Swingline Loan plus the Letter of Credit Exposure shall in no event
         exceed the Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit. In no event will the
         principal amount of loans at any one time outstanding made by any
         Lender pursuant to this Section 2.1 exceed such Lender's Commitment.
         The aggregate principal amount of the loans made pursuant to this
         Section 2.1 at any one time outstanding is referred to as the
         "Revolving Loan".

                  2.1.2.   Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit. The term
         "Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit" means, on any date, the lesser of
         (a) $82,500,000 or such higher amount as may be established pursuant
         to the last sentence of this Section 2.1.2, up to $125,000,000, as
         equals the aggregate amount of Commitments then in effect, minus the
         aggregate of all Net Asset Sale Proceeds, Net Debt Proceeds or Net
         Equity Proceeds required to be prepaid in accordance with Section
         4.1.2, or (b) the amount (in an integral multiple of $1,000,000) to
         which the then applicable amount shall have been irrevocably reduced
         from time to time by notice from the Company to the Agent. Unless a
         Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Borrower may request that the Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit be
         increased, provided that the Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit shall
         not in any event exceed One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Dollars
         ($125,000,000) minus the aggregate of all required prepayments made
         pursuant to Section 4.1.2 and minus all amounts by which the Company
         shall have irrevocably reduced the Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit
         by notice to the Agent from time to time pursuant to clause (b) of the
         preceding sentence, provided, however, that (i) any Lender which is a
         party to this Agreement prior to such increase shall have the first
         option, and may elect, to fund its pro rata share of the increase,
         thereby increasing its Commitment hereunder, but no Lender shall have
         any obligation to do so, (ii) in the event that it becomes necessary
         to include a new Lender to provide additional funding under this
         2.1.2, such new Lender must be reasonably acceptable to the Agent and
         the Borrower, and (iii) the Lenders' Percentage Interests shall be
         correspondingly adjusted, as necessary, to reflect any increase in the
         Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit and the Register shall be amended
         to reflect such adjustments.

                  2.1.3.   Borrowing Requests. Any Borrower may from time to
         time request a loan under Section 2.1.1 by providing to the Agent a
         notice (which may be given by a telephone call received by a Lending
         Officer if promptly confirmed in writing). Such notice must be given
         not later than noon (Boston time) on the requested Closing Date (which
         shall be the third Banking Day prior to the requested Closing Date for
         such loan if any portion of such loan will be subject to a Eurodollar
         Pricing Option on the requested Closing Date). If such notice
         requested that a loan, or any portion thereof, be made subject to a
         Eurodollar Pricing Option, and the Agent shall have notified the
         Borrower pursuant to Section 3.2.2 that such election did not become
         effective, the notice shall be deemed to have been made for a loan at
         the Base Rate. The notice must specify (a) the amount of the requested
         loan (which shall be not less than $1,000,000 and an integral multiple
         of $100,000), (b) the requested Closing Date therefor (which shall be
         a Banking


                                     -21-
<PAGE>


         Day) and (c) the portion of the requested loan that is to be used for
         purposes other than Permitted Acquisitions. Upon receipt of such
         notice, the Agent will promptly inform each other Lender (by telephone
         or otherwise). Each such loan will be made at the Boston Office by
         depositing the amount thereof to the general account of such Borrower
         with the Agent. In connection with each such loan, such Borrower shall
         furnish to the Agent a certificate in substantially the form of
         Exhibit 5.2.1.

                  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, (i) the
         Agent may, in its sole discretion, make Revolving Loans to any
         Borrower under Section 2.1 at any time and in any amount and may apply
         any such Revolving Loan to cover the Credit Obligations of such
         Borrower then due and (ii) subject to all the terms and conditions of
         this Agreement and so long as no Default exists, if any payment of
         interest due under this Agreement in respect of the Revolving Loan is
         not paid when due, the Agent will make Revolving Loans to the Borrower
         under Section 2.1 on the third Banking Day after such payment of
         interest became due in the amount of the interest then due and will
         apply any such Revolving Loan to cover the interest then due (each
         Revolving Loan made under clauses (i) or (ii) of this paragraph being
         a "Credit Obligation Advance").

                  2.1.4.   Loan Accounts; Revolving Notes. The Agent will
         establish on its books separate loan accounts for each Borrower
         (collectively the "Loan Accounts") each of which the Agent shall
         administer as follows: (a) the Agent shall add to each Loan Account,
         and each Loan Account shall evidence, the principal amount of all
         loans from time to time made by the Lenders, in accordance with
         Section 11, to such Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1.1 and (b) the
         Agent shall reduce each Borrower's Loan Account by the amount of all
         payments made on account of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Loan
         Account of such Borrower. The Revolving Loan shall be deemed owed to
         each Lender severally in accordance with such Lender's Percentage
         Interest therein, and all payments credited to the Loan Accounts shall
         be for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Percentage
         Interest in the Revolving Loan. Each Borrower's obligations to pay
         each Lender's Percentage Interest in the Revolving Loan shall be
         evidenced by the notes of such Borrower attached hereto as Exhibit
         2.1.4 (the "Revolving Notes"), payable to each Lender in maximum
         principal amount equal to the amount represented by such Lender's
         Percentage Interest in the Revolving Loan. Each Lender shall keep a
         record of the date and amount of (i) each loan made by it to each
         Borrower pursuant to Section 2.1 and (ii) each payment of principal
         made by such Borrower pursuant to Section 4. Prior to the transfer of
         a Revolving Note, the relevant Lender shall endorse on a schedule
         thereto appropriate notations evidencing such dates and amounts;
         provided, however, that the failure of the Lender to make any such
         recordation or endorsement shall not affect the obligations of such
         Borrower under this Agreement, the Revolving Note or any other Credit
         Document.

         2.2.     Letters of Credit.

                  2.2.1.   Issuance of Letters of Credit. Subject to all the
         terms and conditions of this Agreement and so long as no Default
         exists, from time to time on and after the Initial


                                     -22-
<PAGE>


         Closing Date and prior to the date five Banking Days preceding the
         Final Maturity Date, the Letter of Credit Issuer will, at the request
         of a Borrower, issue for the account of the Borrower one or more
         irrevocable documentary or standby letters of credit (the "Letters of
         Credit"). The sum of Letter of Credit Exposure plus the Revolving Loan
         shall in no event exceed the Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit.
         Letter of Credit Exposure shall in no event exceed $10,000,000.

                  2.2.2.   Requests for Letters of Credit. Each Borrower may
         from time to time request a Letter of Credit to be issued by providing
         to the Letter of Credit Issuer (and the Agent if the Letter of Credit
         Issuer is not the Agent) a notice which is actually received by the
         Agent not less than five Banking Days (for standby Letters of Credit)
         and one Banking Day (for documentary Letters of Credit) prior to the
         requested Closing Date for such Letter of Credit specifying (a) the
         amount of the requested Letter of Credit, (b) the beneficiary thereof,
         (c) the requested Closing Date and (d) a summary of the principal
         terms of the text for such Letter of Credit. Each Letter of Credit
         will be issued by forwarding it to the Borrower or to such other
         Person as directed in writing by the Borrower. In connection with the
         issuance of any Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall furnish to the
         Letter of Credit Issuer (and the Agent if the Letter of Credit Issuer
         is not the Agent) a certificate in substantially the form of Exhibit
         5.2.1 and any customary application forms required by the Letter of
         Credit Issuer. In the event of any inconsistency between such
         application forms and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.

                  2.2.3.   Form and Expiration of Letters of Credit. Each
         Letter of Credit issued under this Section 2.2 and each draft accepted
         or paid under such a Letter of Credit shall be issued, accepted or
         paid, as the case may be, by the Letter of Credit Issuer at its
         principal office. No Letter of Credit shall provide for the payment of
         drafts drawn thereunder, and no draft shall be payable, at a date
         which is later than the earlier of (a) the date 12 months after the
         date of issuance (which expiration date may be extended at the option
         of the Letter of Credit Issuer for additional 12-month periods ending
         on or prior to the date which is five Banking Days prior to the Final
         Maturity Date) or (b) five Banking Days prior to the Final Maturity
         Date. Each Letter of Credit and each draft accepted under a Letter of
         Credit shall be in such form and minimum amount, and shall contain
         such terms, as the Letter of Credit Issuer and the Borrower may agree
         upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.

                  2.2.4.   Lenders' Participation in Letters of Credit. Upon
         the issuance of any Letter of Credit, a participation therein, in an
         amount equal to each Lender's Percentage Interest in the Revolving
         Loan, shall automatically be deemed granted by the Letter of Credit
         Issuer to each such Lender on the date of such issuance and such
         Lenders shall automatically be obligated, as set forth in Section
         10.3, to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer to the extent of their
         respective Percentage Interests in the Revolving Loan for all
         obligations incurred by the Letter of Credit Issuer to third parties
         in respect of such Letter of Credit not reimbursed by the Borrower.
         The Letter of Credit Issuer will send to each


                                     -23-
<PAGE>


         Lender (and the Agent if the Letter of Credit Issuer is not the Agent)
         a confirmation regarding the participations in Letters of Credit
         outstanding during such month.

                  2.2.5.   Reimbursement of Payment. At such time as a Letter
         of Credit Issuer makes any payment on a draft presented or accepted
         under a Letter of Credit, the amount of such payment shall be
         considered a loan under Section 2.1.1 (regardless of whether the
         conditions set forth in Section 5.2 are satisfied) and part of the
         Revolving Loan as if the Borrower had paid in full the amount required
         with respect to the Letter of Credit by borrowing such amount under
         Section 2.1.1, except as provided below. In the event such amount
         would cause the Revolving Loan to exceed the Maximum Amount of
         Revolving Credit or in the event the Agent has previously provided
         written notice to the Borrower that Letter of Credit payments will no
         longer be considered loans under Section 2.1.1, the Borrower will on
         demand pay to the Agent in immediately available funds the amount of
         such payment.

                  2.2.6.   Uniform Customs and Practice. The Uniform Customs
         and Practice for Documentary Credits adopted by a Congress of the
         International Chamber of Commerce, and any subsequent revisions
         thereof approved by a Congress of the International Chamber of
         Commerce and adhered to by the Letter of Credit Issuer (the "Uniform
         Customs and Practice"), shall be binding on the Borrower and the
         Letter of Credit Issuer except to the extent otherwise provided
         herein, in any Letter of Credit or in any other Credit Document.
         Anything in the Uniform Customs and Practice to the contrary
         notwithstanding:

                  (a)      With respect to each Letter of Credit, neither the
         Letter of Credit Issuer nor its correspondents shall be responsible
         for or shall have any duty to ascertain (unless the Letter of Credit
         Issuer or such correspondent is grossly negligent or willful in
         failing so to ascertain):

                           (i)      the genuineness of any signature or the
                  validity, form, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal
                  effect of any endorsements;

                           (ii)     delay in giving, or failure to give, notice
                  of arrival, notice of refusal of documents or of
                  discrepancies in respect of which any Letter of Credit Issuer
                  refuses the documents or any other notice, demand or protest;

                           (iii)    the performance by any beneficiary under
                  any Letter of Credit of such beneficiary's obligations to the
                  Borrower;

                           (iv)     inaccuracy in any notice received by the
                  Letter of Credit Issuer;

                           (v)      the validity, form, sufficiency, accuracy,
                  genuineness or legal effect of any instrument, draft,
                  certificate or other document required by such Letter of
                  Credit to be presented before payment of a draft if such
                  instrument, draft, certificate or other document appears on
                  its face to comply with the


                                     -24-
<PAGE>


                  requirements of the Letter of Credit, or the office held by
                  or the authority of any Person signing any of the same; or

                           (vi)     failure of any instrument to bear any
                  reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit, or
                  failure of any Person to note the amount of any instrument on
                  the reverse of such Letter of Credit or to surrender such
                  Letter of Credit or to forward documents in the manner
                  required by such Letter of Credit.

                  (b)      Except insofar as a particular Letter of Credit
         contains express, contrary instructions, the Letter of Credit Issuer
         may honor as complying with the terms of any Letter of Credit and with
         this Agreement any drafts or other documents otherwise in order signed
         or issued by an administrator, executor, conservator, trustee in
         bankruptcy, debtor in possession, assignee for benefit of creditors,
         liquidator, receiver or other legal representative of the party
         authorized under such Letter of Credit to draw or issue such drafts or
         other documents.

                  (c)      The occurrence of any of the events referred to in
         the Uniform Customs and Practice or in the preceding clauses of this
         Section 2.2.6 shall not affect or prevent the vesting of any of the
         Letter of Credit Issuer's rights or powers hereunder or the Borrower's
         obligation to make reimbursement of amounts paid under any Letter of
         Credit or any draft accepted thereunder.

                  (d)      In the event of any conflict between the provisions
         of this Agreement and the Uniform Customs and Practice, the provisions
         of this Agreement shall govern.

                  2.2.7.   Subrogation. Upon any payment by a Letter of Credit
         Issuer under any Letter of Credit and until the reimbursement of such
         Letter of Credit Issuer by the Borrower with respect to such payment,
         the Letter of Credit Issuer shall be entitled to be subrogated to, and
         to acquire and retain, the rights which the Person to whom such
         payment is made may have against the Borrower, all for the benefit of
         the Lenders. The Borrower will take such action as the Letter of
         Credit Issuer may reasonably request, including requiring the
         beneficiary of any Letter of Credit to execute such documents as the
         Letter of Credit Issuer may reasonably request, to assure and confirm
         to the Letter of Credit Issuer such subrogation and such rights,
         including the rights, if any, of the beneficiary to whom such payment
         is made in accounts receivable, inventory and other properties and
         assets of any Obligor.

                  2.2.8.   Modification, Consent, etc. If the Borrower requests
         or consents in writing to any modification or extension of any Letter
         of Credit, or waives any failure of any draft, certificate or other
         document to comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, the Letter
         of Credit Issuer shall be entitled to rely on such request, consent or
         waiver. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Borrower with respect
         to such Letter of Credit as so modified or extended, and with respect
         to any action taken or omitted by such Letter of Credit Issuer
         pursuant to any such request, consent or waiver.

         2.3.     Swingline Credit.

                  2.3.1.   Swingline Loan. Subject to all the terms and
         conditions of this Agreement and so long as no Default exists, from
         time to time on and after the Initial Closing Date and prior to the
         Final Maturity Date, the Swingline Lender will make loans to the
         Company in such amounts as may be requested by the Company in
         accordance with Section 2.3.2. The sum of the aggregate principal
         amount of loans made under this Section 2.3 at any one time
         outstanding plus the Revolving Loan plus the Letter of Credit Exposure
         shall in no event exceed the Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit. In no
         event will the principal amount of loans made pursuant to this Section
         2.3 at any one time outstanding exceed $10,000,000.

                  2.3.2.   Borrowing Requests. The Company may from time to
         time request a loan under Section 2.3.1 by providing to the Swingline
         Lender a notice (which may be given by a telephone call received by a
         Lending Officer provided that a written notice is subsequently
         delivered to the Swingline Lender within twenty-four (24) hours of
         such telephone call). Such notice must be not later than noon (Boston
         time) on the requested Closing Date (which must be a Banking Day) for
         such loan. The notice must specify the amount of the requested loan
         (which shall be not less than $100,000 and an integral multiple of
         $50,000). Each such loan will be made at the Boston office by
         depositing the amount thereof to the general account of the Company
         with the Swingline Lender. In connection with each such loan, the
         Company shall furnish to the Swingline Lender a certificate in
         substantially the form of Exhibit 5.2.1.

                  2.3.3.   Swingline Loan Account; Swingline Notes. The
         Swingline Lender will establish on its books a loan account for the
         Company (the "Swingline Loan Account") which the Swingline Lender
         shall administer as follows: (a) the Swingline Lender shall add to the
         Swingline Loan Account, and the Swingline Loan Account shall evidence,
         the principal amount of all loans from time to time made by the
         Swingline Lender to the Company pursuant to Section 2.3.1 and (b) the
         Swingline Lender shall reduce the Swingline Loan Account by the amount
         of all payments made on account of the Indebtedness evidenced by the
         Swingline Loan Account. The aggregate principal amount of the
         Indebtedness evidenced by the Swingline Loan Account is referred to as
         the "Swingline Loan". The Company's obligation to pay the Swingline
         Loan shall be evidenced by a note of the Company in substantially the
         form of Exhibit 2.3.3 (the "Swingline Note"), payable to the Swingline
         Lender in maximum principal amount equal to the Swingline Loan.

                  2.3.4.   Conversion of Swingline Loan into Revolving Loan.
         The Swingline Lender may, in its sole discretion, (i) on any Friday,
         or if any Friday is not a Banking Day, on the first preceding Banking
         Day before such Friday, or (ii) on any Banking Day after the
         occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, give
         notice to the other Lenders and the Company that the Swingline Loan
         shall be paid in full with a special mandatory borrowing under the
         Revolving Loan (the "Mandatory Borrowing"). Such a notice of a
         Mandatory Borrowing shall be deemed to have been automatically


                                     -26-
<PAGE>


         given upon a Bankruptcy Default or upon the exercise of any of the
         remedies provided in Section 8.2. Upon the giving of any such notice
         or deemed notice, a Mandatory Borrowing under the Revolving Loan in
         the amount of the Swingline Loan shall be made on the next Banking Day
         from all Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentage
         Interests in the Revolving Loan, and the proceeds thereof shall be
         applied to the Swingline Lender as a repayment of the Swingline Loan.
         Each Lender irrevocably agrees to make such loan pursuant to each such
         Mandatory Borrowing notice in the amount and in the manner specified
         above in this Section 2.3.4, notwithstanding (a) whether any
         conditions specified in Section 5 have been satisfied, (b) that a
         Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or (c)
         the date of such Mandatory Borrowing. In the event that any Mandatory
         Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date required above
         (including as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the
         Bankruptcy Code), each Lender shall promptly purchase from the
         Swingline Lender as of the date the Mandatory Borrowing otherwise
         would have occurred such participation in the Swingline Loan as shall
         be necessary to cause the Lenders to share in the Swingline Loan
         ratably based upon their respective Percentage Interests in the
         Revolving Loan. In the event of such participations, all interest
         payable on the Swingline Loan shall be for the account of the
         Swingline Lender until the date on which the participations are
         required to be purchased and, to the extent attributable to the
         purchased participations, shall be payable to the participants from
         and after such date. At the time any such purchase of participations
         is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall pay the Swingline Lender
         interest on the principal amount of the participation purchased at the
         overnight Federal Funds Rate for each day, commencing with the date
         the Mandatory Borrowing otherwise would have occurred to the date of
         payment for such participation.

         2.4.     Application of Proceeds.

                  2.4.1.   The Loans. Subject to Section 2.4.2, the Borrowers
         will apply the proceeds of the Loans for lawful corporate purposes,
         including (a) to fund Permitted Acquisitions and (b) for working
         capital.

                  2.4.2.   Specifically Prohibited Applications. The Borrowers
         will not, directly or indirectly, apply any part of the proceeds of
         any extension of credit made pursuant to the Credit Documents to
         purchase or to carry Margin Stock or to any transaction prohibited by
         Legal Requirements applicable to the Lenders or by the Credit
         Documents.

                  2.4.3.   Letters of Credit. Letters of Credit shall be issued
         only for such lawful corporate purposes as the Borrower has requested
         in writing and to which the Letter of Credit Issuer agrees.

         2.5.     Nature of Obligations of Lenders to Make Extensions of
Credit. The Lenders' obligations to extend credit under this Agreement are
several and are not joint or joint and several. If on any Closing Date any
Lender shall fail to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the
aggregate amount of Commitments to make the extensions of credit under this
Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of unborrowed Commitment of the Lender
so failing


                                     -27-
<PAGE>


to perform and the Percentage Interests of the relevant Loan shall be
appropriately adjusted. Lenders that have not failed to perform their
obligations to make the extensions of credit contemplated by Section 2 may, if
any such Lender so desires, assume, in such proportions as such Lenders may
agree, the obligations of any Lender who has so failed and the Percentage
Interests shall be appropriately adjusted. The provisions of this Section 2.5
shall not affect the rights of the Borrowers against any Lender failing to
perform its obligations hereunder. Subject to Section 2.3.4, the obligation to
make a Swingline Loan shall be an obligation solely of the Swingline Lender.

         2.6.     Obligations Joint and Several. Each Borrower shall be jointly
and severally liable with all other Borrowers for all Credit Obligations.

3.       Interest; Eurodollar Pricing Options; Fees.

         3.1.     Interest.

                  3.1.1.   Interest on the Revolving Loan. The Revolving Loan
         shall accrue and bear interest at a rate per annum which shall at all
         times equal the Applicable Rate. Prior to any stated or accelerated
         maturity of the Revolving Loan, on each Payment Date each Borrower
         will pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the portion of the
         Revolving Loan evidenced by its Loan Account, which portions were not
         subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option. On the last day of each
         Eurodollar Interest Period or on any earlier termination of any
         Eurodollar Pricing Option, each Borrower will pay the accrued and
         unpaid interest on the portion of the Revolving Loan evidenced by its
         Loan Account which expired or terminated on such date. In the case of
         any Eurodollar Interest Period longer than three months, each Borrower
         will also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the portion of the
         Revolving Loan evidenced by its Loan Account, subject to the
         Eurodollar Pricing Option having such Eurodollar Interest Period at
         three-month intervals, the first such payment to be made on the last
         Banking Day of the three-month period which begins on the first day of
         such Eurodollar Interest Period. On the stated or any accelerated
         maturity of the Revolving Loan, each Borrower will pay all accrued and
         unpaid interest on the portion of the Revolving Loan evidenced by its
         Loan Account, including any accrued and unpaid interest on any portion
         of the Revolving Loan which is subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option.
         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
         the Lenders may require accrued interest to be payable on demand or at
         regular intervals more frequent than each Payment Date. All payments
         of interest hereunder shall be made to the Agent for the account of
         each Lender in accordance with such Lender's Percentage Interest in
         the Revolving Loan.

                  3.1.2.   Interest on the Swingline Loan. The Swingline Loan
         shall accrue and bear interest at a rate per annum which shall at all
         times equal the Swingline Rate. Interest on the Swingline Loan shall
         be calculated on a daily basis and on the basis of a year of 365/366
         days. Prior to any stated or accelerated maturity of the Swingline
         Loan, the Swingline Borrower will on each Payment Date, beginning on
         the first Payment Date after the Initial Closing Date, pay the accrued
         and unpaid interest on such Indebtedness.


                                     -28-
<PAGE>


         On any stated or accelerated maturity of the Swingline Loan all
         accrued and unpaid interest thereon shall be forthwith due and
         payable. All payments of interest hereunder in respect of the
         Swingline Loan shall be made by the Swingline Borrower to the Agent
         for the account of the Swingline Lender.

         3.2.     Eurodollar Pricing Options.

                  3.2.1.   Election of Eurodollar Pricing Options. Subject to
         all of the terms and conditions hereof and so long as no Default
         exists, any Borrower may from time to time, by irrevocable notice to
         the Agent actually received not less than three Banking Days prior to
         the commencement of the Eurodollar Interest Period selected in such
         notice, elect to have such portion of the Revolving Loans as such
         Borrower may specify in such notice accrue and bear interest during
         the Eurodollar Interest Period so selected at the Applicable Rate
         computed on the basis of the Eurodollar Rate. No such election shall
         become effective:

                  (a)      if, prior to the commencement of any such Eurodollar
         Interest Period, the Agent determines that (i) the electing or
         granting of the Eurodollar Pricing Option in question would violate a
         Legal Requirement, (ii) Eurodollar deposits in an amount comparable to
         the principal amount of the Revolving Loan as to which such Eurodollar
         Pricing Option has been elected and which have a term corresponding to
         the proposed Eurodollar Interest Period are not readily available in
         the inter-bank Eurodollar market, or (iii) by reason of circumstances
         affecting the inter-bank Eurodollar market, adequate and reasonable
         methods do not exist for ascertaining the interest rate applicable to
         such deposits for the proposed Eurodollar Interest Period; or

                  (b)      if any Lender shall have advised the Agent by
         telephone or otherwise at or prior to noon (Boston time) on the second
         Banking Day prior to the commencement of such proposed Eurodollar
         Interest Period (and shall have subsequently confirmed in writing)
         that, after reasonable efforts to determine the availability of such
         Eurodollar deposits, such Lender reasonably anticipates that
         Eurodollar deposits in an amount equal to the Percentage Interest of
         such Lender in the portion of the Revolving Loan as to which such
         Eurodollar Pricing Option has been elected and which have a term
         corresponding to the Eurodollar Interest Period in question will not
         be offered in the Eurodollar market to such Lender at a rate of
         interest that does not exceed the anticipated Eurodollar Basic Rate.

                  3.2.2.   Notice to Lenders and the Borrowers. The Agent will
         promptly inform each Lender (by telephone or otherwise) of each notice
         received by it from a Borrower pursuant to Section 3.2.1 and of the
         Eurodollar Interest Period specified in such notice. Upon
         determination by the Agent of the Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar
         Interest Period or in the event such election shall not become
         effective, the Agent will promptly notify such Borrower and each
         Lender (by telephone or otherwise) of the Eurodollar Rate so
         determined or why such election did not become effective, as the case
         may be.


                                     -29-
<PAGE>


                  3.2.3.   Selection of Eurodollar Interest Periods. Eurodollar
         Interest Periods shall be selected so that:

                  (a)      the minimum portion of the Revolving Loan subject to
         any Eurodollar Pricing Option shall be $500,000 and an integral
         multiple of $100,000;

                  (b)      no more than 6 Eurodollar Pricing Options shall be
         outstanding at any one time; and

                  (c)      no Eurodollar Interest Period with respect to any
         part of the Revolving Loan subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option
         shall expire later than the relevant Final Maturity Date.

                  3.2.4.   Additional Interest. If any portion of the Revolving
         Loan subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option is repaid, or any
         Eurodollar Pricing Option is terminated for any reason (including
         acceleration of maturity), on a date which is prior to the last
         Banking Day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable to such
         Eurodollar Pricing Option, the Borrowers will pay to the Agent for the
         account of each Lender in accordance with such Lender's Percentage
         Interest, in addition to any amounts of interest otherwise payable
         hereunder, an amount equal to the present value (calculated in
         accordance with this Section 3.2.4) of interest for the unexpired
         portion of such Eurodollar Interest Period on the portion of the
         Revolving Loans so repaid, or as to which a Eurodollar Pricing Option
         was so terminated, at a per annum rate equal to the excess, if any, of
         (a) the rate applicable to such Eurodollar Pricing Option minus (b)
         the lowest rate of interest obtainable by the Agent upon the purchase
         of debt securities customarily issued by the Treasury of the United
         States of America which have a maturity date approximating the last
         Banking Day of such Eurodollar Interest Period. The present value of
         such additional interest shall be calculated by discounting the amount
         of such interest for each day in the unexpired portion of such
         Eurodollar Interest Period from such day to the date of such repayment
         or termination at a per annum interest rate equal to the interest rate
         determined pursuant to clause (b) of the preceding sentence, and by
         adding all such amounts for all such days during such period. The
         determination by the Agent of such amount of interest shall, in the
         absence of manifest error, be conclusive. For purposes of this Section
         3.2.4, if any portion of the Revolving Loan which was to have been
         subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option is not outstanding on the first
         day of the Eurodollar Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar
         Pricing Option other than for reasons described in Section 3.2.1, the
         Borrowers shall be deemed to have terminated such Eurodollar Pricing
         Option.

                  3.2.5.   Violation of Legal Requirements. If any Legal
         Requirement shall prevent any Lender from funding or maintaining
         through the purchase of deposits in the inter-bank Eurodollar market
         any portion of the Revolving Loans subject to a Eurodollar Pricing
         Option or otherwise from giving effect to such Lender's obligations as
         contemplated by Section 3.2, (a) the Agent may by notice to the
         Borrowers terminate all of the affected Eurodollar Pricing Options,
         (b) the portion of the Revolving Loans subject


                                     -30-
<PAGE>


         to such terminated Eurodollar Pricing Options shall immediately bear
         interest thereafter at the Applicable Rate computed on the basis of
         the Base Rate and (c) the Borrowers shall make any payment required by
         Section 3.2.4.

                  3.2.6.   Funding Procedure. The Lenders may fund any portion
         of the Revolving Loans subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option out of
         any funds available to the Lenders. Regardless of the source of the
         funds actually used by any of the Lenders to fund any portion of the
         Revolving Loans subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option, however, all
         amounts payable hereunder, including the interest rate applicable to
         any such portion of the Revolving Loans and the amounts payable under
         Sections 3.2.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, shall be computed as if each
         Lender had actually funded such Lender's Percentage Interest in such
         portion of the Revolving Loans through the purchase of deposits in
         such amount of the type by which the Eurodollar Basic Rate was
         determined with a maturity the same as the applicable Eurodollar
         Interest Period relating thereto and through the transfer of such
         deposits from an office of the Lender having the same location as the
         applicable Eurodollar Office to one of such Lender's offices in the
         United States of America.

         3.3.     Commitment Fees.

                  3.3.1.   Fee Base. In consideration of the Lenders'
         commitments to make the extensions of credit provided for in Section
         2.1, while such commitments are outstanding, the Borrower will pay to
         the Agent for the account of the Lenders in accordance with the
         Lenders' respective Percentage Interests in the Revolving Loan, on
         each Payment Date, an amount equal to interest computed at the rate
         per annum determined pursuant to Section 3.3.2 on the amount by which
         (a) the average daily Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit during the
         three-month period or portion thereof ending on such Payment Date
         exceeded (b) the sum of (i) the average daily Revolving Loan during
         such period or portion thereof plus (ii) the daily Letter of Credit
         Exposure during such period or portion thereof; provided, however,
         that the first such payment shall be for the period beginning on the
         Initial Closing Date and ending on the first Payment Date.

                  3.3.2.   Fee Rate. On any given Payment Date, the rate
         applied in computing the fee payable pursuant to this Section 3.3
         shall be the rate for Commitment Fees indicated in the definition of
         "Applicable Margin" in Section 1.9 hereof opposite the ratio of
         Consolidated Total Funded Debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA in
         effect on such Payment Date for purposes of such definition.

         3.4.     Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower will pay to the Agent for
the account of each of the Lenders, in accordance with the Lenders' respective
Percentage Interests, on each Payment Date, a Letter of Credit fee equal to
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin indicated for the
Eurodollar Rate on the average daily Letter of Credit Exposure during the three
month period or portion thereof ending on such Payment Date. The Borrower will
pay to the Letter of Credit Issuer (a) customary service charges and expenses
for its services in connection with the Letters of Credit at the times and in
the amounts from time to time in effect


                                     -31-
<PAGE>


in accordance with its general rate structure, plus (b) on each Payment Date a
fronting fee equal to interest at a rate per annum equal to 0.25% on the
aggregate face amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Letter of Credit
Issuer during the three month period or portion thereof ending on such Payment
Date.

         3.5.     Reserve Requirements, etc. If any Legal Requirement shall (a)
impose, modify, increase or deem applicable any insurance assessment, reserve,
special deposit or similar requirement against any Funding Liability, (b)
impose, modify, increase or deem applicable any other requirement or condition
with respect to any Funding Liability, or (c) change the basis of taxation of
Funding Liabilities (other than changes in the rate of taxes measured by the
overall net income of such Lender) and the effect of any of the foregoing shall
be to increase the cost to any Lender of issuing, making, funding or
maintaining its respective Percentage Interest in any portion of the Revolving
Loans subject to a Eurodollar Pricing Option, to reduce the amounts received or
receivable by such Lender under this Agreement or to require such Lender to
make any payment or forego any amounts otherwise payable to such Lender under
this Agreement, then, the Lender shall, promptly after it has made such
determination, give notice thereof to the Company. Promptly after the receipt
by the Company of any such notice, the Company and the Lender shall attempt to
negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the amount payable by the Borrowers to
the Lender under this Section 3.5, which amount shall be sufficient to
compensate the Lender for such increased cost or reduced return. If the Company
and the Lender are unable to agree to such adjustment within thirty days of the
date upon which the Company receives such notice, then the Borrowers will, on
demand by the Lender, pay to the Lender such additional amount as shall be
sufficient, in the Lender's reasonable determination, to compensate the Lender
for such increased cost or such reduced return, together with interest at the
Overdue Reimbursement Rate from the 30th day after receipt of such certificate
until payment in full thereof; provided, however, that the foregoing provisions
shall not apply to any Tax or reserves which are included in computing the
Eurodollar Reserve Rate. The determination by such Lender of the amount of such
costs shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive.

         3.6.     Taxes. All payments of the Credit Obligations shall be made
without set-off or counterclaim and free and clear of any deductions, including
deductions for Taxes, unless the Borrowers are required by law to make such
deductions. If (a) any Lender shall be subject to any Tax with respect to any
payment of the Credit Obligations or its obligations hereunder or (b) any
Borrower shall be required to withhold or deduct any Tax on any payment on the
Credit Obligations, then the Lender shall promptly give notice of its claim for
compensation under this Section 3.6 to the Company. Promptly after the receipt
by the Company of any such notice, the Company and the Lender shall attempt to
negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the amount payable by the Borrowers to
the Lender under this Section 3.6, which amount shall be sufficient to
compensate the Lender for the amount of the Tax so imposed or the full amount
of all payments which would have been received on the Credit Obligations in the
absence of such Tax. If the Company and the Lender are unable to agree to such
adjustment within thirty days of the date upon which the Company receives such
notice, then the Borrowers will, on demand by the Lender, pay to the Lender
such additional amount as shall be sufficient, in the Lender's reasonable
determination, to enable such Lender to receive the amount of Tax so imposed on
the Lender's obligations hereunder or the full amount of all payments which it
would have received


                                     -32-
<PAGE>


on the Credit Obligations (including amounts required to be paid under Sections
3.5, 3.7, 3.8 and this Section 3.6) in the absence of such Tax, as the case may
be, together with interest at the Overdue Reimbursement Rate on such amount
from the 30th day after receipt of such certificate until payment in full
thereof. Whenever Taxes must be withheld by any Borrower with respect to any
payments of the Credit Obligations, the Borrowers shall promptly furnish to the
Agent for the account of the applicable Lender official receipts (to the extent
that the relevant governmental authority delivers such receipts) evidencing
payment of any such Taxes so withheld. If the Borrowers fail to pay any such
Taxes when due or fail to remit to the Agent for the account of the applicable
Lender the required receipts evidencing payment of any such Taxes so withheld
or deducted, the Borrowers shall indemnify the affected Lender for any
incremental Taxes and interest or penalties that may become payable by such
Lender as a result of any such failure. The determination by such Lender of the
amount of such Tax and the basis therefor shall, in the absence of manifest
error, be conclusive.

         3.7.     Capital Adequacy. If any Lender shall determine that
compliance by such Lender with any Legal Requirement regarding capital adequacy
of banks or bank holding companies has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on the capital of such Lender and its Affiliates as a
consequence of such Lender's commitment to make the extensions of credit
contemplated hereby, or such Lender's maintenance of the extensions of credit
contemplated hereby, to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such compliance (taking into consideration the policies of
such Lender and its Affiliates with respect to capital adequacy immediately
before such compliance and assuming that the capital of such Lender and its
Affiliates was fully utilized prior to such compliance) by an amount deemed by
such Lender to be material, then, the Lender shall, promptly after it has made
such determination, give notice thereof to the Company. Promptly after the
receipt by the Company of any such notice, the Company and the Lender shall
attempt to negotiate in good faith an adjustment to the amount payable by the
Borrowers to the Lender under this Section 3.7, which amount shall be
sufficient to compensate the Lender for such reduced return. If the Company and
the Lender are unable to agree to such adjustment within thirty days of the
date upon which the Company receives such notice, then the Borrowers will, on
demand by the Lender, pay to the Lender such additional amount as shall be
sufficient, in the Lender's reasonable determination, to compensate the Lender
for such reduced return, together with interest at the Overdue Reimbursement
Rate from the 30th day until payment in full thereof. The determination by such
Lender of the amount to be paid to it and the basis for computation thereof
shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive. In determining such
amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging, allocation and
attribution methods.

         3.8.     Regulatory Changes. If any Lender shall determine that (a)
any change in any Legal Requirement (including any new Legal Requirement) after
the date hereof shall directly or indirectly (i) reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Lender with respect to the Revolving Loan or the
Letters of Credit or the return to be earned by such Lender on the Revolving
Loan or the Letters of Credit, (ii) impose a cost on such Lender or any
Affiliate of such Lender that is attributable to the making or maintaining of,
or such Lender's commitment to make, its portion of the Revolving Loan or the
Letters of Credit, or (iii) require such Lender or any Affiliate of such Lender
to make any payment on, or calculated by reference to, the gross


                                     -33-
<PAGE>


amount of any amount received by such Lender under any Credit Document, and (b)
such reduction, increased cost or payment shall not be fully compensated for by
an adjustment in the Applicable Rate or the Letter of Credit fees, then, the
Lender shall, promptly after it has made such determination, give notice
thereof to the Company. Promptly after the receipt by the Company of any such
notice, the Company and the Lender shall attempt to negotiate in good faith an
adjustment to the amount payable by the Borrowers to the Lender under this
Section 3.8, which amount, together with any adjustment in the Applicable Rate,
shall be sufficient to fully compensate the Lender for such reduction,
increased cost or payment taking into account any compensation for such
reduction, increased cost or payment received by the Lender pursuant to the
provisions of Section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7 hereof. If the Company and the Lender are
unable to agree to such adjustment within thirty days of the date upon which
the Company receives such notice, then the Borrowers will, on demand by the
Lender, pay to the Lender such additional amount, together with any adjustment
in the Applicable Rate, as shall be sufficient to fully compensate the Lender
for such reduction, increased cost or payment, together with interest on such
amount from the 30th day after receipt of such certificate until payment in
full thereof at the Overdue Reimbursement Rate. The determination by such
Lender of the amount to be paid to it and the basis for computation thereof
hereunder shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive. In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

         3.9.     Computations of Interest and Fees. For purposes of this
Agreement, except as specifically set forth in Section 3.1.2, interest and
commitment fees, Letter of Credit fees (and any other amount expressed as
interest or such fees) shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year for
actual days elapsed. If any payment required by this Agreement becomes due on
any day that is not a Banking Day, such payment shall, except as otherwise
provided in the Eurodollar Interest Period, be made on the next succeeding
Banking Day. If the due date for any payment of principal is extended as a
result of the immediately preceding sentence, interest shall be payable for the
time during which payment is extended at the Applicable Rate.

                  Maximum Amount of Revolving Credit, whether as a result of

                  amounts as are not less than $100,000 and in integral
                  multiples of $50,000, unless such payment is equal to the
                  entire outstanding principal amount of the Swingline Loan.

                  4.1.4.   Reborrowing; Application of Payments. The amounts of
         the Revolving Loan prepaid pursuant to Section 4.1.3 may be reborrowed
         from time to time prior to the Final Maturity Date in accordance with
         Section 2.1. The amount of the Revolving Loan prepaid pursuant to

                                     -35-
<PAGE>


         subject to Eurodollar Pricing Option then the balance of any such
         payment shall be applied to a portion of the Revolving Loan then

                  4.2.1.   Payments at Maturity and Upon Acceleration of
         Maturity. If on the Final Maturity Date or any accelerated maturity of
         the Credit Obligations the Lenders shall be obligated in respect of a
         Letter of Credit or a draft accepted under a Letter of Credit, the
         Borrower will either:

                  (a)      prepay such obligation by depositing cash with the
         Agent, or

                  (b)      deliver to the Agent a standby letter of credit
         (designating the Letter of Credit Issuer as beneficiary and issued by
         a bank and on terms reasonably acceptable to the Letter of Credit
         Issuer),

         in each case in an amount equal to the portion of the then Letter of
         Credit Exposure issued for the account of the Borrower. Any such cash
         so deposited and the cash proceeds of any draw under any standby
         Letter of Credit so furnished, including any interest thereon, shall
         be returned by the Agent to the Borrower only when, and to the extent
         that, the amount of such cash held by the Agent exceeds the Letter of
         Credit Exposure at such time and no Default then exists.

                  4.2.2.   Mandatory Prepayment. If at any time the Letter of
         Credit Exposure exceeds the limits set forth in Section 2.2, the
         Borrower shall within one Banking Day pay the amount of such excess to
         the Agent for the account of the Lenders.

         such tax, assessment, charge or claim need not be paid if the validity
         or amount thereof shall at the time be contested in good faith by
         appropriate proceedings and if such Person shall, in accordance with

         thereto; and provided, further, that each of the Borrowers shall pay
         or bond, or cause to be paid or bonded, all such taxes, assessments,
         charges or other governmental claims immediately upon the commencement
         of proceedings to foreclose any Lien which may have attached as

         Material Adverse Change.

                  6.2.4.   No Subsidiaries. No Borrower shall form or suffer to
         exist any Material Related Entity, except for such Material Related

         licensed under all laws, regulations, ordinances or orders of public
         authorities, or otherwise, to carry on its business in the places and
         in the manner in which it is conducted, except for failures to be so
         qualified, authorized or licensed which would not in the aggregate
         result, or pose a material risk of resulting, in any Material Adverse
         Change.

                  7.1.3.   Capitalization. Other than capital stock issued to
         selling physicians or their advisors as part of the consideration in a

         Agreements").

         7.3.     Changes in Condition. Since December 31, 2000 no Material

reflected on Exhibit 7.4 and except for assets disposed of as permitted by
Section 6.12.

         7.5.     Operations in Conformity With Law, etc. The operations of the
Obligors as now conducted or proposed to be conducted are not in violation of,
nor is any Obligor in default under, any Legal Requirement presently in effect,
except for such violations and defaults as do not and will not, in the
aggregate, result, or create a material risk of resulting, in any Material
Adverse Change. No Obligor has received notice of any such violation or default
or has knowledge of any basis on which the operations of the Obligors, as now
conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted after the date hereof,
would be held so as to violate or to give rise to any such violation or
default, except for such violations and defaults as do not and will not, in the
aggregate, result, or create a material risk of resulting, in any Material
Adverse Change

         7.6.     Litigation. Except as otherwise set forth in Exhibit 7.6, no

other governmental or administrative agency or any arbitrator is pending or, to
the knowledge of any Borrower, threatened which may involve any material risk
of any final judgment, order or liability which, after giving effect to any
applicable insurance, has resulted, or creates a material risk of resulting, in
any Material Adverse Change or which seeks to enjoin the consummation, or which
questions the validity, of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Credit Document. No judgment, decree or order of any
court, board or other governmental or administrative agency or any arbitrator
has been issued against or binds any Obligor which has resulted, or creates a
material risk of resulting, in any Material Adverse Change.

         7.7.     Authorization and Enforceability. Each of the Obligors has
taken all corporate action required to execute, deliver and perform this
Agreement and each other Credit Document to which it is party. No consent of
stockholders of any Obligor is necessary in order to authorize


                                     -51-

delivery of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, nor the making of any
borrowings hereunder, nor the guaranteeing of the Credit Obligations, nor the
securing of the Credit Obligations with the Credit Security, nor the
consummation of any transaction referred to in or contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, nor the fulfillment of the terms hereof

                  (a)      any breach or termination of the provisions of any
         material agreement, instrument, deed or lease to which any Obligor is
         a party or by which it is bound, or of the Charter or By-laws of any
         Obligor;

                  (b)      the violation of any law, statute, judgment, decree
         or governmental order, rule or regulation applicable to any Obligor;

                  (c)      the creation under any agreement, instrument, deed
         or lease of any Lien (other than Liens on the Credit Security which
         secure the Credit Obligations) upon any of the assets of any Obligor;
         or

                  (d)      any redemption, retirement or other repurchase
         obligation of any Obligor under any Charter, Bylaw, agreement,
         instrument, deed or lease.

No approval, authorization or other action by, or declaration to or filing
with, any governmental or administrative authority or any other Person is
required to be obtained or made by any Obligor in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Revolving Notes or
any other Credit Document, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the

or the securing of the Credit Obligations with the Credit Security.

         7.9.     Defaults. None of the Obligors is in default under any
provision of its Charter or By-laws or of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document. None of the Obligors is in default under any provision of any
material agreement, instrument, deed or lease to which it is party or by which
it or its property is bound, except as does not and will not, in the aggregate,
result, or create a material risk of resulting, in any Material Adverse Change.

                                     -52-
<PAGE>


are in full force and effect in all material respects, and each of the Obligors
is in substantial compliance with the foregoing without any known conflict with
the valid rights of others which has resulted, or creates a material risk of
resulting, in any Material Adverse Change. No event has occurred which permits,
or after notice or lapse of time or both would permit, the revocation or
termination of any such license, franchise or other right or which affects the
rights of any of the Obligors thereunder so as to result, or to create a
material risk of resulting, in any Material Adverse Change. No litigation or
other proceeding or dispute exists with respect to the validity or, where
applicable, the extension or renewal, of any of the foregoing which has
resulted, or creates a material risk of resulting, in any Material Adverse
Change.

         7.11.    Tax Returns. Each of the Obligors has filed all material tax
and information returns which are required to be filed by it and has paid, or

additional assessments or any basis therefor. Each of the Obligors reasonably
believes that the charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Obligors
in respect of taxes or other governmental charges are adequate.

         7.12.    Future Expenditures. None of the Obligors anticipate that the
future expenditures, if any, by the Obligors needed to meet the provisions of
any federal, state or foreign governmental statutes, orders, rules or
regulations will be so burdensome as to result, or create a material risk of
resulting, in any Material Adverse Change.

         7.13.    Environmental Regulations.

                  7.13.1.  Environmental Compliance. Each of the Borrowers is
         in compliance in all material respects with the Clean Air Act, the
         Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Marine Protection Research
         and Sanctuaries Act, RCRA, CERCLA and any other Environmental Law in
         effect in any jurisdiction in which any properties of the Borrowers
         are located or where any of them conducts its business, and with all
         applicable published rules and regulations (and applicable standards
         and requirements) of the federal Environmental Protection Agency and
         of any similar agencies in states or foreign countries in which the
         Borrowers conduct their businesses other than those which in the
         aggregate have not resulted, and do not create a material risk of
         resulting, in a Material Adverse Change.

                  7.13.2.  Environmental Litigation. No suit, claim, action or
         proceeding of which any Borrower has been given notice or otherwise
         has knowledge is now pending before any court, governmental agency or
         board or other forum, or to any Borrower's knowledge, threatened by
         any Person (nor to any Borrower's knowledge, does any factual basis
         exist therefor) for, and none of the Borrowers have received written
         correspondence from any federal, state or local governmental authority
         with respect to:

                  (a)      noncompliance by any Borrower with any Environmental
         Law;


                                     -53-
<PAGE>


                  (b)      personal injury, wrongful death or other tortious
         conduct relating to materials, commodities or products used,
         generated, sold, transferred or manufactured by any Borrower
         (including products made of, containing or incorporating asbestos,
         lead or other hazardous materials, commodities or toxic substances);
         or

                  (c)      the release into the environment by any Borrower of
         any Hazardous Material generated by any Borrower whether or not
         occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated by any Borrower.

                  7.13.3.  Environmental Condition of Properties. None of the
         properties owned or leased by any Borrower has been used as a
         treatment, storage or disposal site, other than as disclosed in
         Exhibit 7.13 except uses which have not resulted, and do not create a
         material risk of resulting, in a Material Adverse Change. No Hazardous
         Material is present in any real property currently or formerly owned
         or operated by any Borrower except that which has not resulted, and
         does not create a material risk of resulting, in a Material Adverse
         Change.

         7.14.    Pension Plans. Each Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan)
and, to the knowledge of each of the Obligors, each Multiemployer Plan is in
material compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code and
with Section 6.13. Each Multiemployer Plan and each Plan that constitutes a
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA) are set forth in Exhibit 7.14.
Each Control Group Person has met all of the funding standards applicable to
all Plans that are not Multiemployer Plans, and no condition exists which would
permit the institution of proceedings to terminate any Plan that is not a
Multiemployer Plan under section 4042 of ERISA. To the best knowledge of each
of the Obligors, no Plan that is a Multiemployer Plan is currently insolvent or
in reorganization or has been terminated within the meaning of ERISA.

         7.15.    Acquisition Agreement, etc. Each Acquisition Agreement is a
valid and binding contract as to the Borrower party thereto and, to the best of
such Borrower's knowledge, as to the Sellers party thereto. Such Borrower is
not in default in any material respect of its obligations under any Acquisition
Agreement and, to the best of such Borrower's knowledge, the Sellers party
thereto are not in default in any material respect of any of their obligations
thereunder. The representations and warranties of such Borrower set forth in
each Acquisition Agreement are true and correct in all material respect as of
the date hereof with the same force and effect as though made on and as of the
date hereof. To the best of such Borrower's knowledge all of the
representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in each Acquisition
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects as of the date hereof
with the same force and effect as though made on and as of the date hereof.

         7.16.    Disclosure. Neither this Agreement nor any other Credit
Document to be furnished to the Lenders by or on behalf of any Obligor in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Credit Document
contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein or therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made. No fact is


                                     -54-
<PAGE>


actually known to any Obligor which has resulted, or in the future (so far as
any Obligor can reasonably foresee) will result, or creates a material risk of
resulting, in any Material Adverse Change, except to the extent that present or
future general economic conditions may result in a Material Adverse Change.

"Events of Default":

                  8.1.1.   Payment. Any Borrower shall fail to make any payment
         in respect of: (a) interest or any fee on or in respect of any of the
         Credit Obligations owed by it as the same shall become due and
         payable, and such failure shall continue for a period of three Banking
         Days, (b) any Credit Obligation with respect to payments made by any
         Letter of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit or any draft drawn
         thereunder within three Banking Days after demand therefor by such

         Obligations owed by it as the same shall become due, whether at
         maturity or by acceleration or otherwise.

                  8.1.2.   Specified Covenants. Any Obligor shall fail to
         perform or observe any of the provisions of Section 6.4.5 or Sections
         6.5 through and including 6.15.

                  8.1.3.   Other Covenants. Any Obligor shall fail to perform
         or observe any other covenant, agreement or provision to be performed
         or observed by it under this Agreement or any other Credit Document,
         and such failure shall not be rectified or cured to the written
         satisfaction of the Required Lenders within 30 days after the earlier
         of (a) notice thereof by the Agent to the Borrowers or (b) knowledge
         thereof by the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of
         the Company.

                  8.1.4.   Representations and Warranties. Any representation
         or warranty of or with respect to any Obligor made to the Lenders or
         the Agent in, pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or any
         other Credit Document shall be materially false on the date as of
         which it was made.

                  8.1.5.   Cross Default. Any Obligor shall fail to make any
         payment when due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods)
         in respect of any Indebtedness or of any Capitalized Lease (other than
         the Credit Obligations) outstanding in an aggregate amount of
         principal (whether or not due) of $1,000,000 or more or shall fail to
         perform or observe any material terms evidencing or securing any such
         Indebtedness or Capitalized Lease, the result of which failure is to
         permit the holder of such Indebtedness or Capitalized Lease to cause
         such Indebtedness or Capitalized Lease to become due before its stated
         maturity.

                  8.1.6.   Enforceability, etc. Any Credit Document or any
         Material Agreement shall cease for any reason (other than the
         scheduled termination thereof in accordance with its terms) to be
         enforceable in accordance with its terms or in full force and effect;
         or any Obligor in respect of any Credit Document or any Material
         Agreement shall so


                                     -55-
<PAGE>


         assert in a judicial or similar proceeding; or the security interests
         created by this Agreement or any other Credit Documents shall cease to
         be enforceable and of the same effect and priority purported to be
         created hereby.

                  8.1.7.   Medicaid, etc. Any of the Borrowers receives notice
         of exclusion from eligibility from Medicaid or any of the Borrowers or
         their officers, employees or agents engage in activities which are
         prohibited by any of the federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback
         Statute, 42 U.S.C. ss.1320a-7b, the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act
         (the "Stark Law") 42 U.S.C. ss.1395 nn, as amended, the regulations
         promulgated thereunder, or related state or local statutes or
         regulations or which are prohibited by rules of professional conduct
         except where the failure to so comply could not result in a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  8.1.8.   Change of Control. There shall be a change of
         control in the Company which may consist of any of (i) the acquisition
         by any Person or group of Persons acting as a group of beneficial
         ownership (within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
         as amended), directly or indirectly, of thirty-five percent (35%) or
         more of the voting capital stock of the Company, or (ii) the board of

         majority of directors in office on the Initial Closing Date.

                  8.1.9.   Judgments. A final judgment (a) which, with other
         outstanding final judgments against the Obligors, exceeds an aggregate
         of $2,500,000 in excess of applicable insurance coverage shall be
         rendered against any Obligor, or (b) which grants injunctive relief
         that results, or creates a material risk of resulting, in a Material
         Adverse Change and in either case if, (i) within 60 days after entry
         thereof, such judgment shall not have been discharged or execution
         thereof stayed pending appeal or (ii) within 60 days after the
         expiration of any such stay, such judgment shall not have been
         discharged.

                  8.1.10.  ERISA. Any "reportable event" (as defined in section
         4043 of ERISA) shall have occurred that reasonably could be expected
         to result in termination of a Material Plan or the appointment by the
         appropriate United States District Court of a trustee to administer
         any Material Plan or the imposition of a Lien in favor of a Material
         Plan; or any ERISA Group Person shall fail to pay when due amounts

         4219(c)(5) of ERISA and such proceeding shall not have been dismissed
         within 30 days thereafter; or a condition shall exist by reason of
         which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree adjudicating that
         any Material Plan must be terminated.

                  8.1.11.  Bankruptcy, etc. Any Obligor (other than a
         Bankruptcy Eligible Obligor) shall:

                  (a)      commence a voluntary case under the Bankruptcy Code
         or authorize, by appropriate proceedings of its board of directors or
         other governing body, the commencement of such a voluntary case;

                  (b)      (i) have filed against it a petition commencing an
         involuntary case under the Bankruptcy Code that shall not have been
         dismissed within 60 days after the date on which such petition is
         filed, or (ii) file an answer or other pleading within such 60-day
         period admitting or failing to deny the material allegations of such a
         petition or seeking, consenting to or acquiescing in the relief

         in any involuntary case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code;

                  (c)      seek relief as a debtor under any applicable law,
         other than the Bankruptcy Code, of any jurisdiction relating to the
         liquidation or reorganization of debtors or to the modification or
         alteration of the rights of creditors, or consent to or acquiesce in
         such relief;

                  (d)      have entered against it an order by a court of
         competent jurisdiction (i) finding it to be bankrupt or insolvent,
         (ii) ordering or approving its liquidation or reorganization as a
         debtor or any modification or alteration of the rights of its
         creditors or (iii) assuming custody of, or appointing a receiver or

                  (e)      make an assignment for the benefit of, or enter into
         a composition with, its creditors, or appoint, or consent to the
         appointment of, or suffer to exist a receiver or other custodian for,
         all or a substantial portion of its property.

         8.2.     Certain Actions Following an Event of Default. If any one or
more Events of Default shall occur and be continuing, then in each and every
such case:

                  8.2.1.   Terminate Obligation to Extend Credit. The Agent on
         behalf of the Lenders may (and upon written request of the Lenders
         holding at least one-third of the Percentage Interests the Agent
         shall) terminate the obligations of the Lenders to make any further
         extensions of credit under the Credit Documents by furnishing notice
         of such termination to the Borrowers.

                  8.2.2.   Specific Performance; Exercise of Rights. The Agent
         on behalf of the Lenders may (and upon written request of the Lenders
         holding at least one-third of the Percentage Interests the Agent
         shall) proceed to protect and enforce the Lenders' rights by suit in
         equity, action at law and/or other appropriate proceeding, either for
         specific performance of any covenant or condition contained in this
         Agreement or any other Credit Document or in any instrument or
         assignment delivered to the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement or any
         other Credit Document, or in aid of the exercise of any power


                                     -57-
<PAGE>


         granted in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any such
         instrument or assignment.

                  8.2.3.   Acceleration. The Agent on behalf of the Lenders may
         (and upon written request of the Lenders holding at least one-third of
         the Percentage Interests the Agent shall) by notice in writing to the
         Borrowers declare all or any part of the unpaid balance of the Credit
         Obligations then outstanding to be immediately due and payable,
         require the Borrower immediately to deposit with the Agent in cash an
         amount equal to the then Letter of Credit Exposure (which cash shall
         be held and applied as provided in Section 4.2), and thereupon such
         unpaid balance or part thereof and such amount equal to the Letter of
         Credit Exposure shall become so due and payable without presentation,
         protest or further demand or notice of any kind, all of which are
         hereby expressly waived; provided, however, that if a Bankruptcy
         Default shall have occurred, the unpaid balance of the Credit
         Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

                  8.2.4.   Enforcement of Payment. The Agent on behalf of the
         Lenders may (and upon written request of the Lenders holding at least
         one-third of the Percentage Interests the Agent shall) proceed to
         enforce payment of the Credit Obligations in such manner as it may
         elect to cancel, or instruct other Letter of Credit Issuers to cancel,
         any outstanding Letters of Credit which permit the cancellation
         thereof. The Lenders may offset and apply toward the payment of the
         Credit Obligations (and/or toward the curing of any Event of Default)
         any Indebtedness from the Lenders to the respective Obligors,
         including any Indebtedness represented by deposits in any account
         maintained with the Lenders, regardless of the adequacy of any
         security for the Credit Obligations. The Lenders shall have no duty to
         determine the adequacy of any such security in connection with any
         such offset.

                  8.2.5.   Cumulative Remedies. To the extent not prohibited by
         applicable law which cannot be waived, all of the Lenders' rights
         hereunder and under each other Credit Document shall be cumulative.

         8.3.     Annulment of Defaults. Any Default or Event of Default shall
be deemed not to exist or to have occurred for any purpose of the Credit
Documents if the Required Lenders or the Agent (with the consent of the
Required Lenders) shall have waived such Default or Event of Default in
writing, stated in writing that the same has been cured to such Lenders'
reasonable satisfaction or entered into an amendment to this Agreement which by
its express terms cures such Event of Default, at which time such Event of
Default shall no longer be deemed to exist or to have continued. No such action
by the Lenders or the Agent shall extend to or affect any subsequent Event of
Default or impair any rights of the Lenders upon the occurrence thereof. The
making of any extension of credit during the existence of any Default or Event
of Default shall not constitute a waiver thereof.

         8.4.     Waivers. To the extent that such waiver is not prohibited by
the provisions of applicable law that cannot be waived, each of the Obligors
waives:


                                     -58-
<PAGE>


                  (a)      all presentments, demands for performance, notices
         of nonperformance (except to the extent required by this Agreement or
         any other Credit Document), protests, notices of protest and notices
         of dishonor;

                  (b)      any requirement of diligence or promptness on the
         part of any Lender in the enforcement of its rights under this
         Agreement, the Revolving Notes, the Swingline Note or any other Credit
         Document;

                  (c)      any and all notices of every kind and description
         which may be required to be given by any statute or rule of law; and

                  (d)      any defense (other than indefeasible payment in
         full) which it may now or hereafter have with respect to its liability
         under this Agreement, the Revolving Notes, the Swingline Note or any
         other Credit Document or with respect to the Credit Obligations.

9.       Guarantees.

         9.1.     Guarantees of Credit Obligations. Each Guarantor
unconditionally jointly and severally guarantees that the Credit Obligations
will be performed and will be paid in full in immediately available funds when
due and payable, whether at the stated or accelerated maturity thereof or
otherwise, this guarantee being a guarantee of payment and not of
collectability and being absolute and in no way conditional or contingent. In
the event any part of the Credit Obligations shall not have been so paid in
full when due and payable, each Guarantor will, immediately upon notice by the
Agent or, without notice, immediately upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy
Default, pay or cause to be paid to the Agent for the account of each Lender in
accordance with the Lenders' respective Percentage Interests the amount of such
Credit Obligations which are then due and payable and unpaid. The obligations
of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by the invalidity,
unenforceability or irrecoverability of any of the Credit Obligations as
against any other Obligor, any other guarantor thereof or any other Person. For
purposes hereof, the Credit Obligations shall be due and payable when and as
the same shall be due and payable under the terms of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document notwithstanding the fact that the collection or
enforcement thereof may be stayed or enjoined under the Bankruptcy Code or
other applicable law.

         9.2.     Continuing Obligation. Each Guarantor acknowledges that the
Lenders and the Agent have entered into this Agreement (and, to the extent that
the Lenders or the Agent may enter into any future Credit Document, will have
entered into such agreement) in reliance on this Section 9 being a continuing
irrevocable agreement, and such Guarantor agrees that its guarantee may not be
revoked in whole or in part. The obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall
terminate when the commitment of the Lenders to extend credit under this
Agreement shall have terminated and all of the Credit Obligations have been
indefeasibly paid in full in immediately available funds and discharged;
provided, however, that:

                  (a)      if a claim is made upon the Lenders at any time for
         repayment or recovery of any amounts or any property received by the
         Lenders from any source on account of


                                     -59-
<PAGE>


         any of the Credit Obligations and the Lenders repay or return any
         amounts or property so received (including interest thereon to the
         extent required to be paid by the Lenders) or

                  (b)      if the Lenders become liable for any part of such
         claim by reason of (i) any judgment or order of any court or
         administrative authority having competent jurisdiction, or (ii) any
         settlement or compromise of any such claim,

then the Guarantors shall remain liable under this Agreement for the amounts so
repaid or property so returned or the amounts for which the Lenders become
liable (such amounts being deemed part of the Credit Obligations) to the same
extent as if such amounts or property had never been received by the Lenders,
notwithstanding any termination hereof or the cancellation of any instrument or
agreement evidencing any of the Credit Obligations. Not later than five days
after receipt of notice from the Agent, the Guarantors shall jointly and
severally pay to the Agent an amount equal to the amount of such repayment or
return for which the Lenders have so become liable. Payments hereunder by a
Guarantor may be required by the Agent on any number of occasions.

         9.3.     Waivers with Respect to Credit Obligations. Except to the
extent expressly required by this Agreement or any other Credit Document, each
Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of
applicable law, all of the following (including all defenses, counterclaims and
other rights of any nature based upon any of the following):

                  (a)      presentment, demand for payment and protest of
         nonpayment of any of the Credit Obligations, and notice of protest,
         dishonor or nonperformance;

                  (b)      notice of acceptance of this guarantee and notice
         that credit has been extended in reliance on the Guarantor's guarantee
         of the Credit Obligations;

                  (c)      notice of any Default or of any inability to enforce
         performance of the obligations of the Company or any other Person with
         respect to any Credit Document, or notice of any acceleration of
         maturity of any Credit Obligations;

                  (d)      demand for performance or observance of, and any
         enforcement of any provision of, the Credit Obligations, this
         Agreement or any other Credit Document or any pursuit or exhaustion of
         rights or remedies with respect to any Credit Security or against the
         Company or any other Person in respect of the Credit Obligations or
         any requirement of diligence or promptness on the part of the Agent or
         the Lenders in connection with any of the foregoing;

                  (e)      any act or omission on the part of the Agent or the
         Lenders which may impair or prejudice the rights of the Guarantor,
         including rights to obtain subrogation, exoneration, contribution,
         indemnification or any other reimbursement from the Company or any
         other Person, or otherwise operate as a deemed release or discharge;


                                     -60-
<PAGE>


                  (f)      failure or delay to perfect or continue the
         perfection of any security interest in any Credit Security or any
         other action which harms or impairs the value of, or any failure to
         preserve or protect the value of, any Credit Security;

                  (g)      any statute of limitations or any statute or rule of
         law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither
         larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than the
         obligation of the principal;

                  (h)      any "single action" or "anti-deficiency" law which
         would otherwise prevent the Lenders from bringing any action,
         including any claim for a deficiency, against the Guarantor before or
         after the Agent's or the Lenders' commencement or completion of any
         foreclosure action, whether judicially, by exercise of power of sale
         or otherwise, or any other law which would otherwise require any
         election of remedies by the Agent or the Lenders;

                  (i)      all demands and notices of every kind with respect
         to the foregoing; and

                  (j)      to the extent not referred to above, all defenses
         (other than payment) which the Company may now or hereafter have to
         the payment of the Credit Obligations, together with all suretyship
         defenses, which could otherwise be asserted by such Guarantor.

Each Guarantor represents that it has obtained the advice of counsel as to the
extent to which suretyship and other defenses may be available to it with
respect to its obligations hereunder in the absence of the waivers contained in
this Section 9.3.

         No delay or omission on the part of the Agent or the Lenders in
exercising any right under this Agreement or any other Credit Document or under
any guarantee of the Credit Obligations or with respect to the Credit Security
shall operate as a waiver or relinquishment of such right. No action which the
Agent or the Lenders or the Company may take or refrain from taking with
respect to the Credit Obligations, including any amendments thereto or
modifications thereof or waivers with respect thereto, shall affect the
provisions of this Agreement or the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.
None of the Lenders' or the Agent's rights shall at any time in any way be
prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of any Obligor,
or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants
of this Agreement, regardless of any knowledge thereof which the Agent or the
Lenders may have or otherwise be charged with.

         9.4.     Lenders' Power to Waive, etc. Each Guarantor grants to the
Lenders full power in their discretion, without notice to or consent of such
Guarantor, such notice and consent being expressly waived to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, and without in any way affecting the liability of
the Guarantor under its guarantee hereunder:

                  (a)      To waive compliance with, and any Default under, and
         to consent to any amendment to or modification or termination of any
         terms or provisions of, or to give any


                                     -61-
<PAGE>


         waiver in respect of, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, the
         Credit Security, the Credit Obligations or any guarantee thereof (each
         as from time to time in effect);

                  (b)      To grant any extensions of the Credit Obligations
         (for any duration), and any other indulgence with respect thereto, and
         to effect any total or partial release (by operation of law or
         otherwise), discharge, compromise or settlement with respect to the
         obligations of the Obligors or any other Person in respect of the
         Credit Obligations, whether or not rights against the Guarantor under
         this Agreement are reserved in connection therewith;

                  (c)      To take security in any form for the Credit
         Obligations, and to consent to the addition to or the substitution,
         exchange, release or other disposition of, or to deal in any other
         manner with, any part of any property contained in the Credit Security
         whether or not the property, if any, received upon the exercise of
         such power shall be of a character or value the same as or different
         from the character or value of any property disposed of, and to
         obtain, modify or release any present or future guarantees of the
         Credit Obligations and to proceed against any of the Credit Security
         or such guarantees in any order;

                  (d)      To collect or liquidate or realize upon any of the
         Credit Obligations or the Credit Security in any manner or to refrain
         from collecting or liquidating or realizing upon any of the Credit
         Obligations or the Credit Security; and

                  (e)      To extend credit under this Agreement, any other
         Credit Document or otherwise in such amount as the Lenders may
         determine, including increasing the amount of credit and the interest
         rate and fees with respect thereto, even though the condition of the
         Obligors (financial or otherwise on an individual or Consolidated
         basis) may have deteriorated since the date hereof.

         9.5.     Information Regarding the Borrowers, etc. Each Guarantor has
made such investigation as it deems desirable of the risks undertaken by it in
entering into this Agreement and is fully satisfied that it understands all
such risks. Each Guarantor waives any obligation which may now or hereafter
exist on the part of the Agent or the Lenders to inform it of the risks being
undertaken by entering into this Agreement or of any changes in such risks and,
from and after the date hereof, each Guarantor undertakes to keep itself
informed of such risks and any changes therein. Each Guarantor expressly waives
any duty which may now or hereafter exist on the part of the Agent or the
Lenders to disclose to the Guarantor any matter related to the business,
operations, character, collateral, credit, condition (financial or otherwise),
income or prospects of the Borrowers or their respective Affiliates or their
properties or management, whether now or hereafter known by the Agent or the
Lenders. Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that it assumes sole
responsibility for obtaining from the Borrowers all information concerning this
Agreement and all other Credit Documents and all other information as to the
Borrowers and their respective Affiliates or their properties or management as
such Guarantor deems necessary or desirable.

         9.6.     Certain Guarantor Representations. Each Guarantor represents
that:

                  (a)      it is in its best interest and in pursuit of the
         purposes for which it was organized as an integral part of the
         business conducted and proposed to be conducted by the Borrowers and
         their respective Subsidiaries, and reasonably necessary and convenient
         in connection with the conduct of the business conducted and proposed
         to be conducted by them, to induce the Lenders to enter into this
         Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrowers by making the
         Guarantees contemplated by this Section 9,

                  (b)      the credit available hereunder will directly or
         indirectly inure to its benefit,

                  (c)      by virtue of the foregoing it is receiving at least
         reasonably equivalent value from the Lenders for its Guarantee,

                  (d)      it will not be rendered insolvent as a result of
         entering into this Agreement,

                  (e)      after giving effect to the transactions contemplated
         by this Agreement, it will have assets having a fair saleable value in
         excess of the amount required to pay its probable liability on its
         existing debts as they become absolute and matured,

                  (f)      it has, and will have, access to adequate capital
         for the conduct of its business,

                  (g)      it has the ability to pay its debts from time to
         time incurred in connection with its business as such debts mature,
         and

                  (h)      it has been advised by the Agent that the Lenders
         are unwilling to enter into this Agreement unless the Guarantees
         contemplated by this Section 9 are given by it.

         9.7.     Subrogation. Each Guarantor agrees that, until the Credit
Obligations are paid in full, it will not exercise any right of reimbursement,
subrogation, contribution, offset or other claims against the other Obligors
arising by contract or operation of law in connection with any payment made or
required to be made by such Guarantor under this Agreement. After the payment
in full of the Credit Obligations, each Guarantor shall be entitled to exercise
against the Borrowers and the other Obligors all such rights of reimbursement,
subrogation, contribution and offset, and all such other claims, to the fullest
extent permitted by law.

         9.8.     Subordination. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that,
after the occurrence of an Event of Default, all Indebtedness, claims and
liabilities then or thereafter owing by the Borrowers or any other Obligor to
such Guarantor whether arising hereunder or otherwise are subordinated to the
prior payment in full of the Credit Obligations and are so subordinated as a
claim against such Obligor or any of its assets, whether such claim be in the
ordinary course of business or in the event of voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution, insolvency or bankruptcy, so that no payment with
respect to any such Indebtedness, claim or liability will be made or received
while any Event of Default exists.

to join this Agreement as a Borrower and a Guarantor pursuant to a joinder
agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 5.2.2. Each Guarantor will,
promptly upon the request of the Agent from time to time, execute, acknowledge

purposes of this Section 9.

                  (a)      all reasonable expenses of the Agent (including the

         10.2.    General Indemnity. The Borrowers shall indemnify the Lenders
and the Agent and hold them harmless from any liability, loss or damage
resulting from the violation by the Borrowers of Section 2.4. In addition, the

Agent's directors, officers and employees, and each Person, if any, who controls
any Lender or the Agent (each Lender, the Agent and each of such directors,
officers, employees and control Persons is referred to as an "Indemnified
Party") and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all claims,
damages, liabilities and reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel with whom any Indemnified Party may consult in
connection therewith and all reasonable expenses of litigation or preparation
therefor) which any Indemnified Party may incur or which may be asserted against
any Indemnified Party in connection with (a) the Indemnified Party's compliance

Obligors or their Affiliates, (b) any litigation or investigation involving the
Obligors or their Affiliates, or any officer, director or employee thereof, or
(c) this Agreement, any other Credit Document or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity shall not
apply to litigation commenced by any Borrower or Obligor against the Lenders or
the Agent which seeks enforcement of any of the rights of such Borrower or
Obligor hereunder or under any other Credit Document and is determined adversely
to the Lenders or the Agent in a final nonappealable judgment or to the extent
such claims, damages, liabilities and expenses result from a Lender's or the
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.


         10.3.    Indemnity With Respect to Letters of Credit. The Borrower
shall indemnify each Letter of Credit Issuer and its correspondents and hold
each of them harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities,

liability, damage or expense arising out of any transfer, sale, delivery,
surrender or endorsement of any invoice, bill of lading, warehouse receipt or
other document at any time held by the Agent, such Letter of Credit Issuer or
held for their respective accounts by any of their correspondents, in connection
with any Letter of Credit, except to the extent such claims, losses,
liabilities, damages and expenses result from gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Agent or any other Letter of Credit Issuer.

                                               Maximum Principal                    Loan and Letter

</TABLE>

The foregoing percentage interests, as from time to time in effect and reflected
in the Register, are referred to as the "Percentage Interests" with respect to
all or any portion of the Revolving Loan, and Letter of Credit Exposure, and the
related Commitments.

         11.2.    Agent's Authority to Act, etc. Each of the Lenders appoints
and authorizes the Agent to act for the Lenders as the Lenders' Agent in
connection with the transactions


                                      -65-
<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement and the other Credit Documents on the terms set
forth herein. In acting hereunder, the Agent is acting for the account of the
Agent to the extent of its Percentage Interest in each Loan and for the account
of each other Lender to the extent of the Lenders' respective Percentage
Interests, and all action in connection with the enforcement of, or the exercise
of any remedies (other than the Lenders' rights of set-off as provided in
Section 8.2.4 or in any Credit Document) in respect of the Credit Obligations
and Credit Documents shall be taken by the Agent. No other agent or arranger
named hereunder (other than the Agent) shall have any duties or obligations
under the Credit Documents.

         11.3.    Borrowers to Pay Agent, etc. Each Obligor shall be fully
protected in making all payments in respect of the Credit Obligations to the
Agent, in relying upon consents, modifications and amendments executed by the
Agent purportedly on the Lenders' behalf, and in dealing with the Agent as
herein provided. The Agent may charge the accounts of the Borrowers, on the
dates when the amounts thereof become due and payable, with the amounts of the
principal of and interest on the Revolving Loan, Swingline Loan, any amounts
paid by the Letter of Credit Issuers to third parties under Letters of Credit or
drafts presented thereunder, commitment fees and all other fees and amounts
owing under any Credit Document.

         11.4.    Lender Operations for Advances.

                  11.4.1.  Advances. On each Closing Date, each Lender shall
         advance to the Agent in immediately available funds such Lender's
         Percentage Interest in the portion of the Revolving Loan advanced on
         such Closing Date prior to 2:00 p.m. (Boston time). If such funds are
         not received at such time, but all applicable conditions set forth in
         Section 5 have been satisfied, each Lender authorizes and requests the
         Agent to advance for the Lender's account, pursuant to the terms
         hereof, the Lender's respective Percentage Interest in such portion of
         the Revolving Loan and agrees to reimburse the Agent in immediately
         available funds for the amount thereof prior to 3:00 p.m. (Boston time)
         on the day any portion of the Revolving Loan is advanced hereunder;
         provided, however, that the Agent is not authorized to make any such
         advance for the account of any Lender who has previously notified the
         Agent in writing that such Lender will not be performing its
         obligations to make further advances hereunder; and provided, further,
         that the Agent shall be under no obligation to make any such advance.

                  11.4.2.  Letters of Credit. Each of the Lenders authorizes and
         requests each Letter of Credit Issuer to issue the Letters of Credit
         provided for in Section 2.2 and to grant each Lender a participation in
         each of such Letters of Credit in an amount equal to its Percentage
         Interest in the amount of each such Letter of Credit. Promptly upon the
         request of the Letter of Credit Issuer, each Lender shall reimburse the
         Letter of Credit Issuer in immediately available funds for such
         Lender's Percentage Interest in the amount of all obligations to third
         parties incurred by the Letter of Credit Issuer in respect of each
         Letter of Credit and each draft accepted under a Letter of Credit to
         the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower by 2:00 p.m. (Boston time) on
         the Banking Day when due. The Letter of Credit Issuer will notify each
         Lender of the issuance of any Letter of Credit, the amount and date of
         payment of any draft drawn or accepted under a Letter of Credit


                                      -66-
<PAGE>

         and whether in connection with the payment of any such draft the amount
         thereof was added to the Revolving Loan or was reimbursed by the
         Borrower.

                  11.4.3.  Agent to Allocate Payments, etc. All payments of
         principal and interest in respect of the extensions of credit made
         pursuant to this Agreement, reimbursement of amounts paid by any Letter
         of Credit Issuer to third parties under Letters of Credit or drafts
         presented thereunder, commitment fees, Letter of Credit fees and other
         fees under this Agreement shall, as a matter of convenience, be made by
         the Borrowers and the Guarantors to the Agent in immediately available
         funds. The share of each Lender shall be credited to such Lender by the
         Agent in immediately available funds in such manner that the principal
         amount of the Credit Obligations to be paid shall be paid
         proportionately in accordance with the Lenders' respective Percentage
         Interests in such Credit Obligations, except as otherwise provided in
         this Agreement. Under no circumstances shall any Lender be required to
         produce or present its Revolving Notes as evidence of its interests in
         the Credit Obligations in any action or proceeding relating to the
         Credit Obligations.

                  11.4.4.  Delinquent Lenders; Nonperforming Lenders. In the
         event that any Lender fails to reimburse the Agent pursuant to Section
         11.4.1 for the Percentage Interest of such Lender (a "Delinquent
         Lender") in any credit advanced by the Agent pursuant hereto, overdue
         amounts (the "Delinquent Payment") due from the Delinquent Lender to
         the Agent shall bear interest, payable by the Delinquent Lender on
         demand, at a per annum rate equal to (a) the Federal Funds Rate for the
         first three days overdue and (b) the sum of 2% plus the Federal Funds
         Rate for any longer period. Such interest shall be payable to the Agent
         for its own account for the period commencing on the date of the
         Delinquent Payment and ending on the date the Delinquent Lender
         reimburses the Agent on account of the Delinquent Payment (to the
         extent not paid by the Company as provided below) and the accrued
         interest thereon (the "Delinquency Period"), whether pursuant to the
         assignments referred to below or otherwise. Upon notice by the Agent,
         the Borrowers will pay to the Agent the principal (but not the
         interest) portion of the Delinquent Payment. During the Delinquency
         Period, in order to make reimbursements for the Delinquent Payment and
         accrued interest thereon, the Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have
         assigned to the Agent all interest, commitment fees and other payments
         made by the Borrowers under Section 3 that would have thereafter
         otherwise been payable under the Credit Documents to the Delinquent
         Lender. During any other period in which any Lender is not performing
         its obligations to extend credit under Section 2 (a "Nonperforming
         Lender"), the Nonperforming Lender shall be deemed to have assigned to
         each Lender that is not a Nonperforming Lender (a "Performing Lender")
         all principal and other payments made by the Borrowers under Section 4
         that would have thereafter otherwise been payable under the Credit
         Documents to the Nonperforming Lender. The Agent shall credit a portion
         of such payments to each Performing Lender in an amount equal to the
         Percentage Interest of such Performing Lender in an amount equal to the
         Percentage Interest of such Performing Lender divided by one minus the
         Percentage Interest of the Nonperforming Lender until the respective
         portions of the Revolving Loan owed to all the Lenders are the same as
         the Percentage Interests of the Lenders


                                      -67-
<PAGE>

         immediately prior to the failure of the Nonperforming Lender to perform
         its obligations under Section 2. The foregoing provisions shall be in
         addition to any other remedies the Agent, the Performing Lenders or the
         Borrowers may have under law or equity against the Delinquent Lender as
         a result of the Delinquent Payment or against the Nonperforming Lender
         as a result of its failure to perform its obligations under Section 2.

         11.5.    Sharing of Payments, etc. Each Lender agrees that (a) if by
exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, it shall receive
payment of (i) a proportion of the aggregate amount due with respect to its
Percentage Interest in the Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Exposure which is
greater than (ii) the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of the
aggregate amount due with respect to such other Lender's Percentage Interest in
the Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Exposure and (b) if such inequality
shall continue for more than 10 days, the Lender receiving such proportionately
greater payment shall purchase participations in the Percentage Interests in the
Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Exposure held by the other Lenders, and such
other adjustments shall be made from time to time (including rescission of such
purchases of participations in the event the unequal payment originally received
is recovered from such Lender through bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise), as
may be required so that all such payments of principal and interest with respect
to the Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Exposure held by the Lenders shall be
shared by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests in the Revolving Loan; provided, however, that this Section 11.5 shall
not impair the right of any Lender to exercise any right of set-off or
counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such exercise to the
payment of Indebtedness of any Obligor other than such Obligor's Indebtedness
with respect to the Revolving Loan and Letter of Credit Exposure. Each Lender
that grants a participation in the Credit Obligations to a Credit Participant
shall require as a condition to the granting of such participation that such
Credit Participant agree to share payments received in respect of the Credit
Obligations as provided in this Section 11.5. The provisions of this Section
11.5 are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Lenders and no failure of any
Lender to comply with the terms hereof shall be available to any Obligor as a
defense to the payment of the Credit Obligations.

         11.6.    Amendments, Consents, Waivers, etc. The Agent may admit
additional Lenders who shall make Commitments or allow existing Lenders to
increase their Commitments; provided, however, that without consent obtained in
accordance with Sections 11.6(b)(iii) the aggregate Commitments shall not exceed
$125,000,000. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the Agent may, with the
written consent of Lenders owning at least 51% of the Percentage Interests
(disregarding the Percentage Interest of any Delinquent Lenders during the
existence of a Delinquency Period so long as such Delinquent Lender is treated
the same as the other Lenders with respect to any actions contemplated below),
and upon the written request of the Required Lenders the Agent shall, take or
refrain from taking any action under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, including giving its written consent to any modification of or
amendment to and waiving in writing compliance with any covenant or condition in
this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any Default or Event of Default,
all of which actions shall be binding upon all of the Lenders; provided,
however, that:


                                      -68-
<PAGE>

                  (a)      Without the written consent of Lenders owning at
         least 51% of the Percentage Interests (disregarding the Percentage
         Interest of any Delinquent Lenders during the existence of a
         Delinquency Period so long as such Delinquent Lender is treated the
         same as the other Lenders with respect to any actions enumerated
         below), no written modification of, amendment to, consent with respect
         to, waiver of compliance with or waiver of a Default under any of the
         Credit Documents, or under Sections 6.5 through 6.16, the related
         defined terms or this Section 11.6 shall be made.

                  (b)      Without the written consent of such Lenders as own
         100% of the Percentage Interests in the Revolving Loan (other than
         Delinquent Lenders during the existence of a Delinquency Period so long
         as such Delinquent Lender is treated the same as the other Lenders with
         respect to any actions enumerated below):

                           (i)      No reduction shall be made in (i) the amount
                  of principal of the Loan or reimbursement obligations for
                  payments made under Letters of Credit, (ii) the interest rate
                  on the Revolving Loan or the Swingline Loan or (iii) the
                  Letter of Credit fees or commitment fees.

                           (ii)     No change shall be made in the stated time
                  of payment of all or any portion of the Loan or interest
                  thereon or reimbursement of payments made under Letters of
                  Credit or fees relating to any of the foregoing payable to all
                  of the Lenders and no waiver shall be made of any Default
                  under Section 8.1.1.

                           (iii)    Except for additional Commitments from new
                  Lenders or increased Commitments from existing Lenders
                  expressly contemplated by Section 11.6 hereof, no increase
                  shall be made in the amount, or extension of the term, of the
                  Commitments beyond that provided for under Section 2.

                           (iv)     No release of, or subordination of the
                  Lenders' interests in, all or substantially all of the Credit
                  Security and no release of the Borrower or any material
                  Guarantor shall be made (in any event, without the written
                  consent of the Lenders, the Agent may release particular items
                  of Credit Security or particular Guarantors in dispositions
                  permitted by Section 6.12, as modified by amendments thereto
                  approved by the Required Lenders, and may release all Credit
                  Security pursuant to Section 15 upon payment in full of the
                  Credit Obligations and termination of the Commitments).

                           (v)      No alteration shall be made of the Lenders'
                  rights of set-off contained in Section 8.2.4.

                           (vi)     No amendment to or modification of this
                  Section 11.6 or the definition of "Required Lenders" shall be
                  made.

                  (c)      Without the written consent of a Letter of Credit
         Issuer, no amendment of modification of any Credit Document shall
         affect the rights or duties of such Letter of Credit Issuer under the
         Credit Documents.

         11.7.    Agent's Resignation. The Agent may resign at any time by
giving at least 60 days' prior written notice of its intention to do so to each
other of the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon any such resignation, the Lenders
(other than the resigning Agent) shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent, subject, unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, to the Borrower's consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld. If no successor to the Agent shall have been so appointed by the
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) calendar
days after the resigning Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the
resigning Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent from
among the remaining Lenders. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
resigning Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. The new Agent appointed pursuant to this Section 11.7
shall immediately issue new Letters of Credit in place of Letters of Credit
previously issued by the resigning Agent, or if acceptable to the resigning
Agent, issue letters of credit in favor of the resigning Agent as security for
such outstanding Letters of Credit and shall in due course replace all Letters
of Credit previously issued by the resigning Agent. In connection with the
appointment of a successor Agent, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent a
processing and recordation fee of $3,000. Upon the appointment of a new Agent
hereunder, the term "Agent" shall for all purposes of this Agreement thereafter
mean such successor. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Agreement shall continue to inure to the benefit of such
Agent as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
under this Agreement.

         11.8.    Concerning the Agent.

                  11.8.1.  Action in Good Faith, etc. The Agent and its
         officers, directors, employees and agents shall be under no liability
         to any of the Lenders or to any future holder of any interest in the
         Credit Obligations for any action or failure to act taken or suffered
         in good faith, and any action or failure to act in accordance with an
         opinion of its counsel shall conclusively be deemed to be in good
         faith. The Agent shall in all cases be entitled to rely, and shall be
         fully protected in relying, on instructions given to the Agent by the
         required holders of Credit Obligations as provided in this Agreement.

                  11.8.2.  No Implied Duties, etc. The Agent shall have and may
         exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent under
         this Agreement or any other Credit Document together with all other
         powers incidental thereto. The Agent shall have no implied duties to
         any Person or any obligation to take any action under this Agreement or
         any other Credit Document except for action specifically provided for
         in this Agreement or any other Credit Document to be taken by the
         Agent. Before taking any action under this Agreement or any other
         Credit Document, the Agent may request an appropriate specific
         indemnity satisfactory to it from each Lender in addition to the
         general indemnity provided for in Section 11.11. Until the Agent has
         received such specific indemnity, the Agent shall not be obligated to
         take (although it may in its sole discretion take) any such action
         under this Agreement or any other Credit Document. Each Lender confirms
         that the Agent does not have a fiduciary relationship to it under the


                                      -70-
<PAGE>

         Credit Documents. Each of the Obligors party hereto confirms that
         neither the Agent nor any other Lender has a fiduciary relationship to
         it under the Credit Documents.

                  11.8.3.  Validity, etc. The Agent shall not be responsible to
         any Lender or any future holder of any interest in the Credit
         Obligations (a) for the legality, validity, enforceability or
         effectiveness of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (b) for
         any recitals, reports, representations, warranties or statements
         contained in or made in connection with this Agreement or any other
         Credit Document, (c) for the existence or value of any assets included
         in any security for the Credit Obligations, or (d) for the
         effectiveness of any Lien purported to be included in any security for
         the Credit Obligations.

                  11.8.4.  Compliance. The Agent shall not be obligated to
         ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the
         terms of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; and in connection
         with any extension of credit under this Agreement or any other Credit
         Document, the Agent shall be fully protected in relying on a
         certificate of the Borrowers as to the fulfillment by the Borrowers of
         any conditions to such extension of credit.

                  11.8.5.  Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may
         execute any of its duties as Agent under this Agreement or any other
         Credit Document by or through employees, agents and attorneys-in-fact
         and shall not be responsible to any of the Lenders, any Borrower or any
         other Obligor for the default or misconduct of any such agents or
         attorneys-in-fact selected by the Agent acting in good faith. The Agent
         shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters
         pertaining to the agency hereby created and its duties hereunder or
         under any other Credit Document.

                  11.8.6.  Reliance on Documents and Counsel. The Agent shall be
         entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
         affidavit, certificate, cablegram, consent, instrument, letter, notice,
         order, document, statement, telecopy, telegram, telex or teletype
         message or writing reasonably believed in good faith by the Agent to be
         genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the Person
         in question, including any telephonic or oral statement made by such
         Person, and, with respect to legal matters, upon an opinion or the
         advice of counsel selected by the Agent.

                  11.8.7.  Agent's Reimbursement. Each of the Lenders severally
         agrees to reimburse the Agent, in the amount of such Lender's
         Percentage Interest, for any reasonable expenses not reimbursed by the
         Borrowers or the Guarantors (without limiting the obligation of the
         Borrowers or the Guarantors to make such reimbursement): (a) for which
         the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by the Borrowers or the
         Guarantors under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, and (b)
         after the occurrence of a Default, for any other reasonable expenses
         incurred by the Agent on the Lenders' behalf in connection with the
         enforcement of the Lenders' rights under this Agreement or any other
         Credit Document.


                                      -71-
<PAGE>

         11.9.    Rights as a Lender. With respect to any credit extended by it
hereunder, the Agent shall have the same rights, obligations and powers
hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though
it were not the Agent, and unless the context otherwise specifies, the Agent
shall be treated in its individual capacity as though it were not the Agent
hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Percentage
Interest of the Agent shall be included in any computations of Percentage
Interests. The Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
act as trustee for and generally engage in any kind of banking or trust business
with any Borrower, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of any
of them and any Person who may do business with or own an equity interest in any
Borrower, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of any of them,
all as if the Agent were not the Agent and without any duty to account therefor
to the other Lenders.

         11.10.   Independent Credit Decision. Each of the Lenders acknowledges
that it has independently and without reliance upon the Agent, based on the
financial statements and other documents referred to in Section 7.2, on the
other representations and warranties contained herein and on such other
information with respect to the Obligors as such Lender deemed appropriate, made
such Lender's own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and
to make the extensions of credit provided for hereunder. Each Lender represents
to the Agent that such Lender will continue to make its own independent credit
and other decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any
other Credit Document. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither the Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to such Lender, and no act
by the Agent taken under this Agreement or any other Credit Document, including
any review of the affairs of the Obligors, shall be deemed to constitute any
representation or warranty by the Agent. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to each Lender by the Agent under
this Agreement or any other Credit Document, the Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition, financial or
otherwise, or creditworthiness of any Obligor which may come into the possession
of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

         11.11.   Indemnification. The holders of the Credit Obligations shall
indemnify the Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents (to the
extent not reimbursed by the Obligors and without limiting the obligation of any
of the Obligors to do so), pro rata in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Agent or such Persons relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, any other Credit Document, the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, or any action taken or omitted by the Agent in connection
with any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
extend to actions or omissions which are taken by the Agent with gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

12.      Successors and Assigns; Lender Assignments and Participations. Any
reference in this Agreement to any of the parties hereto shall be deemed to
include the successors and assigns of such party, and all covenants and
agreements by or on behalf of the Obligors, the Guarantors, the


                                      -72-
<PAGE>

Agent or the Lenders that are contained in this Agreement or any other Credit
Documents shall bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and
assigns; provided, however, that (a) the Obligors may not assign their rights or
obligations under this Agreement except for mergers or liquidations permitted by
Section 6.12, and (b) the Lenders shall be not entitled to assign their
respective Percentage Interests in the Revolving Loan hereunder except as set
forth below in this Section 12.

         12.1.    Assignments by Lenders.

                  12.1.1.  Assignees and Assignment Procedures. Each Lender may
         (a) without the consent of the Agent or the Company if the proposed
         assignee is already a Lender hereunder or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of
         the same corporate parent of which the assigning Lender is a Wholly
         Owned Subsidiary, or (b) otherwise with the consents of the Agent and
         (so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) the
         Company (which consents will not be unreasonably withheld), in
         compliance with applicable laws in connection with such assignment,
         assign to one or more commercial banks or other financial institutions
         (each, an "Assignee") all or a portion of its interests, rights and
         obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
         including all or a portion, which shall be pro rata between the
         Revolving Loan and the Letter of Credit Exposure, of its Commitment,
         the portion of the Revolving Loan, and the Letter of Credit Exposure at
         the time owing to it and the Revolving Notes held by it but excluding
         its rights and obligations as a Letter of Credit Issuer; provided,
         however, that:

                  (a)      the aggregate amount of the Commitment of the
         assigning Lender subject to each such assignment to any Assignee other
         than another Lender, a Related Fund, any Eligible Assignee that
         acquires all or a substantial portion of the assets of a Lender or an
         Affiliate of a Lender (determined as of the date the Assignment and
         Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent)
         shall be not less than $2,500,000 and in increments of $500,000 (or, if
         less, the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's
         Commitment); and

                  (b)      the parties to each such assignment shall execute and
         deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance (the "Assignment and
         Acceptance") substantially in the form of Exhibit 12.1.1, together with
         the Note subject to such assignment and, except in the event of a
         transfer pursuant to Section 12.3 or to another Lender, a Related Fund,
         any Eligible Assignee that acquires all or a substantial portion of the
         assets of a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, a processing fee of
         $3,500 payable to the Agent by the assigning Lender (or as the
         assigning Lender and the Assignee may otherwise agree between
         themselves).

Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to Section 12.1.4, from and after the
effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance (which effective date
shall be at least five Banking Days after the execution thereof unless waived by
the Agent):


                                      -73-
<PAGE>

                           (i)      the Assignee shall be a party hereto and, to
                  the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have
                  the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement
                  and

                           (ii)     the assigning Lender shall, to the extent
                  provided in such assignment, be released from its obligations
                  under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
                  Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
                  assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
                  Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
                  shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
                  3.2.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 10, as well as to any fees
                  accrued for its account hereunder and not yet paid).

                  12.1.2.  Terms of Assignment and Acceptance. By executing and
         delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the assigning Lender and
         Assignee shall be deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and
         the other parties hereto as follows:

                  (a)      other than the representation and warranty that it is
         the legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned thereby
         free and clear of any adverse claim, such assigning Lender makes no
         representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
         to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
         connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality, validity,
         enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement,
         any other Credit Document or any other instrument or document furnished
         pursuant hereto;

                  (b)      such assigning Lender makes no representation or
         warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial
         condition of the Obligors or the performance or observance by any
         Obligor of any of its obligations under this Agreement, any other
         Credit Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant
         hereto;

                  (c)      such Assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
         this Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial
         statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 6.4 and such
         other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate to make
         its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
         Acceptance;

                  (d)      such Assignee will independently and without reliance
         upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on
         such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
         time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
         action under this Agreement;

                  (e)      such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to
         take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers
         under this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof,
         together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and


                                      -74-
<PAGE>

                  (f)      such Assignee agrees that it will perform in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement all the obligations which
         are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  12.1.3.  Register. The Agent shall maintain at the Boston
         Office a register (the "Register") for the recordation of (a) the
         Commitments from time to time of each Lender (including any Lenders who
         have been admitted by the Agent or have increased their Commitments in
         accordance with Section 11.6 after the Initial Closing Date), (b) the
         names and addresses of the Lenders and the Assignees which assume
         rights and obligations pursuant to an assignment under Section 12.1.1,
         (c) the Percentage Interest of each such Lender as set forth in Section
         11.1 and (d) the amount of the Revolving Loan and the Letter of Credit
         Exposure owing to each Lender from time to time. The entries in the
         Register shall be conclusive, in the absence of manifest error, and the
         Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name
         is registered therein for all purposes as a party to this Agreement.
         The Register shall be available for inspection by any Borrower or any
         Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
         prior notice.

                  12.1.4.  Acceptance of Assignment and Assumption. Upon its
         receipt of a completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
         assigning Lender and an Assignee together with the Revolving Notes
         subject to such assignment, and the processing and recordation fee
         referred to in Section 12.1.1, the Agent shall (a) accept such
         Assignment and Acceptance, (b) record the information contained therein
         in the Register and (c) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower.
         Within five Banking Days after receipt of notice, the Borrowers, at
         their own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent, in exchange
         for the surrendered Revolving Notes, new Revolving Notes to the order
         of such Assignee in a principal amount equal to the applicable
         Commitment and Revolving Loan assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment
         and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment
         and Revolving Loan, new Revolving Notes to the order of such assigning
         Lender in a principal amount equal to the applicable Commitment and
         Revolving Loan retained by it. Such new Revolving Notes shall be in an
         aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of
         such surrendered Revolving Notes, respectively, and shall be dated the
         date of the surrendered Revolving Notes which they replace.

                  12.1.5.  Federal Reserve Bank. Notwithstanding the foregoing
         provisions of this Section 12, any Lender may at any time pledge or
         assign all or any portion of such Lender's rights under this Agreement
         and the other Credit Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided,
         however, that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender
         from such Lender's obligations hereunder or under any other Credit
         Document.

                  12.1.6.  Further Assurances. The Obligors shall sign such
         documents and take such other actions from time to time reasonably
         requested by an Assignee to enable it to share in the benefits of the
         rights created by the Credit Documents.

<PAGE>

         12.2.    Credit Participants. Each Lender may, without the consent of
the Borrowers or the Agent, in compliance with applicable laws in connection
with such participation, sell to one or more commercial banks or other financial
institutions (each a "Credit Participant") participations in all or a portion of
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment, the Revolving Loan, the
Letter of Credit Exposure and the Revolving Note held by it); provided, however,
that:

                  (a)      such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
         remain unchanged;

                  (b)      such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
         other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations;

                  (c)      the Credit Participant shall be entitled to the
         benefit of the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 3.2.4,
         3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 10, but shall not be entitled to receive any
         greater payment thereunder than the selling Lender would have been
         entitled to receive with respect to the interest so sold if such
         interest had not been sold; and

                  (d)      the Borrowers, the Agent and the other Lenders shall
         continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection
         with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and
         such Lender shall retain the sole right as one of the Lenders to vote
         with respect to the enforcement of the obligations of the Borrowers
         relating to the Revolving Loan, the Letter of Credit Exposure and the
         approval of any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of
         this Agreement (other than amendments, modifications, consents or
         waivers described in clause (b) of the proviso to Section 11.6).

Each Obligor agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that any
Credit Participant and any Lender purchasing a participation from another Lender
pursuant to Section 11.5 may exercise all rights of payment (including the right
of set-off), with respect to its participation as fully as if such Credit
Participant or such Lender were the direct creditor of the Obligors and a Lender
hereunder in the amount of such participation.

         12.3.    Replacement of Lender. In the event that any Lender or, to the
extent applicable, any Credit Participant (the "Affected Lender"):

                  (a)      fails to perform its obligations to fund any portion
         of the Revolving Loan or to issue any Letter of Credit on any Closing
         Date when required to do so by the terms of the Credit Documents, or
         fails to provide its portion of any Eurodollar Pricing Option pursuant
         to Section 3.2.1 or on account of a Legal Requirement as contemplated
         by Section 3.2.5;

                  (b)      demands payment under the Reserve provisions of
         Section 3.5, the Tax provisions of Section 3.6, the capital adequacy
         provisions of Section 3.7 or the regulatory change provisions in
         Section 3.8 in an amount the Company deems materially in excess of the
         amounts with respect thereto demanded by the other Lenders; or


                                      -76-
<PAGE>

                  (c)      refuses to consent to a proposed amendment,
         modification, waiver or other action requiring consent of the holders
         of 100% of the Percentage Interests under Section 11.6(b) that is
         consented to by the other Lenders;

then, so long as no Event of Default exists and is continuing, the Borrowers
shall have the right to seek a replacement lender which is reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent (the "Replacement Lender"). The Replacement Lender
shall purchase the interests of the Affected Lender in the Revolving Loan,
Letters of Credit and its Commitment and shall assume the obligations of the
Affected Lender hereunder and under the other Credit Documents upon execution by
the Replacement Lender of an Assignment and Acceptance and the tender by it to
the Affected Lender of a purchase price agreed between it and the Affected
Lender (or, if they are unable to agree, a purchase price in the amount of the
Affected Lenders' Percentage Interest in the Revolving Loan plus the amount of
all other outstanding Credit Obligations including all accrued and unpaid Credit
Obligations then owed to the Affected Lender). Such assignment by the Affected
Lender shall be deemed an early termination of any Eurodollar Pricing Option to
the extent of the Affected Lender's portion thereof, and the Borrowers will pay
to the Affected Lender any resulting amounts due under Section 3.2.4. Upon
consummation of such assignment, the Replacement Lender shall become party to
this Agreement as a signatory hereto and shall have all the rights and
obligations of the Affected Lender under this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents with a Percentage Interest equal to the Percentage Interest of the
Affected Lender, the Affected Lender shall be released from its obligations
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, and no further consent or action
by any party shall be required. Upon the consummation of such assignment, the
Borrowers, the Agent and the Affected Lender shall make appropriate arrangements
so that a new Revolving Note is issued to the Replacement Lender if it has
acquired a portion of the Revolving Loan. The Borrowers and the Guarantors shall
sign such documents and take such other actions reasonably requested by the
Replacement Lender to enable it to share in the benefits of the rights created
by the Credit Documents. Until the consummation of an assignment in accordance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.3, the Borrowers shall continue
to pay to the Affected Lender any Credit Obligations as they become due and
payable.

13.      Notices. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, any notice
required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be given in writing. Any
notice, consent, approval, demand or other communication in connection with this
Agreement shall be deemed to be given if given in writing (including telex,
telecopy or similar teletransmission) addressed as provided below (or to the
addressee at such other address as the addressee shall have specified by notice
actually received by the addresser), and if either (a) actually delivered in
fully legible form to such address (evidenced in the case of a telex by receipt
of the correct answerback) or (b) in the case of a letter, unless actual receipt
of the notice is required by any Credit Document five days shall have elapsed
after the same shall have been deposited in the United States mails, with
first-class postage prepaid and registered or certified.

         If to any of the Borrowers or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to
them at their address set forth in Exhibit 7.1 (as supplemented pursuant to
Sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2), to the attention of the chief financial officer.


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

         If to any Lender or the Agent, to it at its address set forth on the
signature pages of this Agreement or in the Register, with a copy to the Agent.

14.      Course of Dealing; Amendments and Waivers. No course of dealing between
any Lender or the Agent, on one hand, and the Borrowers or any other Obligor, on
the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of any of the Lenders' or the Agent's
rights under this Agreement or any other Credit Document or with respect to the
Credit Obligations. Each of the Borrowers and the Guarantors acknowledges that
if the Lenders or the Agent, without being required to do so by this Agreement
or any other Credit Document, give any notice or information to, or obtain any
consent from, any Borrower or any other Obligor, the Lenders and the Agent shall
not by implication have amended, waived or modified any provision of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or created any duty to give any such
notice or information or to obtain any such consent on any future occasion. No
delay or omission on the part of any Lender of the Agent in exercising any right
under this Agreement or any other Credit Document or with respect to the Credit
Obligations shall operate as a waiver of such right or any other right hereunder
or thereunder. A waiver on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to
or waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion. No waiver, consent or
amendment with respect to this Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be
binding unless it is in writing and signed by the Agent or the Required Lenders.

15.      Defeasance. When all Credit Obligations have been paid, performed and
reasonably determined by the Lenders to have been indefeasibly discharged in
full, and if at the time no Lender continues to be committed to extend any
credit to the Borrowers hereunder or under any other Credit Document, this
Agreement shall terminate and, at the Borrowers' written request, accompanied by
such certificates and other items as the Agent shall reasonably deem necessary,
the Credit Security shall revert to the Obligors and the right, title and
interest of the Lenders therein shall terminate. Thereupon, on the Obligor's
demand and at their cost and expense, the Agent shall execute proper
instruments, acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Agreement, and
shall redeliver to the Obligors any Credit Security then in its possession;
provided, however, that Sections 3.2.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 10 and 11.8.7 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

16.      Venue; Service of Process. Each of the Borrowers and the other
Obligors:

         16.1.    Irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
state courts of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts for the purpose of any suit, action or other proceeding arising
out of or based upon this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the subject
matter hereof or thereof.

         16.2.    Waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable law that
cannot be waived, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or
otherwise, in any such proceeding brought in any of the above-named courts, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court, that
its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that such
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such
proceeding is improper,


                                      -78-
<PAGE>

or that this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the subject matter
hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such court.

Each of the Borrowers and the other Obligors consents to service of process in
any such proceeding in any manner at the time permitted by Chapter 223A of the
General Laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and agrees that service of
process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at its
address specified in or pursuant to Section 16 is reasonably calculated to give
actual notice.

17.      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH OF THE BORROWERS, THE OTHER OBLIGORS, THE AGENT AND
THE LENDERS WAIVES, AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF,
DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF
ANY ISSUE, CLAIM OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT
DOCUMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR THEREOF OR ANY CREDIT OBLIGATION OR IN
ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE DEALINGS OF THE LENDERS, THE AGENT, THE BORROWERS OR
ANY OTHER OBLIGOR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. Each
of the Borrowers and the other Obligors acknowledges that it has been informed
by the Agent that the provisions of this Section 17 constitute a material
inducement upon which each of the Lenders has relied and will rely in entering
into this Agreement and any other Credit Document, and that it has reviewed the
provisions of this Section 17 with its counsel. Any Lender, the Agent, any
Borrower or any other Obligor may file an original counterpart or a copy of this
Section 17 with any court as written evidence of the consent of the Borrowers,
the other Obligors, the Agent and the Lenders to the waiver of their rights to
trial by jury.

18.      General. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made
in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in certificates delivered
pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to have been relied on by each
Lender, notwithstanding any investigation made by any Lender on its behalf, and
shall survive the execution and delivery to the Lenders hereof and thereof. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any provision hereof shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. The headings in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise
affect the meaning hereof. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents
(including any related fee agreements with the Agent or the Lenders) constitute
the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings
and agreements, whether written or oral. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts which together shall constitute one instrument. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws (other
than the conflict of laws rules) of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

                                   SCHEDULE I
                                 TO THE ANNEXED
               [__]% [SUBORDINATED] [CONVERTIBLE] PROMISSORY NOTE
           WHICH FORMS A PART OF THE NOTE AND IS INCORPORATED THEREIN

                                  SUBORDINATION

                  (a)      Anything in this Note to the contrary
         notwithstanding, the obligation of Maker to pay the principal of and
         interest on this Note, and to discharge all its other obligations
         hereunder, shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the
         extent set forth in this Schedule I, to the Senior Indebtedness. The
         term "Senior Indebtedness" means all principal, interest, fees, costs,
         enforcement expenses (including legal fees and disbursements),
         collateral protection expenses and other reimbursement or indemnity
         obligations created or evidenced by (x) the Amended and Restated Credit
         Agreement, originally dated as of June 27, 1996, as amended and
         restated as of November 1, 2000, as further amended and restated on
         August 14, 2001 and as further amended or restated from time to time
         (the "Senior Loan Agreement"), among Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.
         ("Pediatrix") and the Material Related Entities (as defined in the
         Senior Loan Agreement) of Pediatrix from time to time party thereto and
         the several banks named therein (in such capacity hereinafter the
         "Lenders") and Fleet National Bank, as Agent (in such capacity,
         including any successor or replacement agent, hereinafter the "Agent")
         for the Lenders (including any renewal, extension, modification,
         amendment, refinancing, refunding or replacement of the Senior Loan
         Agreement), including, without limitation, any security agreement,
         guarantee, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to or in
         connection with the Senior Loan Agreement, and (y) other than
         liabilities owing to the Maker's trade creditors, any guaranty,
         instrument, indebtedness, liability or obligation of the Maker not in
         violation of the Senior Loan Agreement, whether or not related thereto.
         Senior Indebtedness shall expressly include any and all interest
         accruing or out of pocket costs or expenses incurred after the date of
         any filing by or against Maker of any petition under the Federal
         Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
         act regardless of whether the Agent's or any Lender's claim therefor is
         allowed or allowable in the case or proceeding relating thereto.

                           (i)      In the event of any insolvency, bankruptcy,
                  liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceedings, or
                  any receivership proceedings in connection therewith, relative
                  to Maker or its creditors or its property, and in the event of
                  any proceedings for voluntary liquidation, dissolution or
                  other winding up of Maker, whether or not involving insolvency
                  or bankruptcy proceedings, then all Senior Indebtedness shall
                  first be paid in full in cash, before any payment on account
                  of principal or interest is made upon this Note.

                           (ii)     In any of the proceedings referred to in
                  subparagraph (a)(i) above, any payment or distribution of any
                  kind or character, whether in cash, property, stock or
                  obligations which may be payable or deliverable in respect of
                  this Note shall be paid or delivered directly to the Agent
                  with respect to any Senior Indebtedness owed to the Lenders
                  and to the other holders of any Senior


                                      -1-
<PAGE>

                  Indebtedness with respect to any such indebtedness owed to
                  them, for application in payment thereof, unless and until all
                  Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash.

                           (iii)    In the event of any default under any
                  instrument evidencing any Senior Indebtedness or under any
                  document pursuant to which the same shall have been issued
                  permitting the holder of such Senior Indebtedness to
                  accelerate the maturity thereof, which default shall continue
                  without cure or waiver, and the effect of such default is to
                  accelerate or permit the acceleration of the maturity of such
                  obligation or the holder thereof shall cause such obligation
                  to become due prior to the stated maturity thereof or such
                  obligation shall not be paid at maturity, Maker will not make,
                  directly or indirectly, to the holder of this Note any payment
                  of any kind of or on account of all or any part of this Note,
                  and the holder of this Note will not accept from Maker any
                  payment of any kind of or on account of all or any part of
                  this Note, unless and until all such Senior Indebtedness shall
                  have been paid in full in cash.

         Upon request of any holder of Senior Indebtedness, the holder of this
Note will affirm its obligations under this Schedule I.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding any other provision of this Note,
         upon the occurrence of any event described in subparagraph (a)(iii)
         above, [except for conversion of this Note in accordance with Schedule
         II hereto,] no holder of this Note may, without the prior written
         consent of the Agent, so long as any Senior Indebtedness is outstanding
         to the Lenders, and thereafter of the other holders of Senior
         Indebtedness, (i) ask, collect, demand or sue for any payment,
         distribution or any other remedy in respect of the indebtedness
         evidenced by this Note; (ii) enforce the indebtedness evidenced by this
         Note or any part thereof or take any act to foreclose or realize upon
         the indebtedness evidenced by this Note or any part thereof; (iii)
         commence, or join with any other creditor (other than the holders of
         any Senior Indebtedness or any representative thereof) in commencing
         any proceeding referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) above or (iv) declare
         any amount of the indebtedness evidenced by this Note to be due and
         payable; provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph (b)
         shall terminate automatically upon the commencement of any proceeding
         referred to in subparagraph (a)(i) above or upon the acceleration of
         the maturity of any Senior Indebtedness or the institution of any
         foreclosure or other proceedings to enforce the payment of such
         obligations.

                  (c)      In furtherance of the foregoing provisions of this
         Schedule I:

                           (i)      The holder of this Note will not take or
                  omit to take any action or assert any claim with respect to
                  the indebtedness evidenced by this Note or otherwise which is
                  inconsistent with the provisions of this Note.

                           (ii)     In case any direct or indirect payment or
                  distribution shall be received by any holder of this Note in
                  contravention of any provision of this Note, including,
                  without limitation, subparagraph (a)(iii) above, the holder of
                  this Note will hold in trust and immediately pay over to the
                  Agent of the account of the Lenders and the Agent, in the same
                  form of payment received, the appropriate


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                  endorsements, for application to the Senior Indebtedness owed
                  to such Lenders any cash amount that Maker pays to the holder
                  of this Note with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by
                  this Note, or as collateral for the Senior Indebtedness owed
                  to such Lenders any other assets of Maker that the holder of
                  this Note may receive with respect to the indebtedness
                  evidenced by this Note. So long as any direct or indirect
                  payment or distribution shall be received by any holder in
                  accordance with (and not in contravention of) the provisions
                  of this Note, then in any such event such holder shall have no
                  obligation to hold such payment or distribution in trust for
                  the benefit of the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

                           (iii)    At any meeting of creditors of Maker or in
                  the event of any case or proceeding, voluntary or involuntary,
                  for the distribution, division or application of all or part
                  of the assets of Maker or the proceeds thereof, whether such
                  case or proceeding be for the liquidation, dissolution or
                  winding up of Maker or its business, a receivership,
                  insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding, an assignment for
                  the benefit of creditors or a proceeding by or against Maker
                  for relief under the Federal Bankruptcy Code or any other
                  bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency law or any other law
                  relating to the relief of debtors, readjustment of
                  indebtedness, reorganization, arrangement, composition or
                  extension or marshalling of assets or otherwise, the Agent is
                  hereby irrevocably authorized at any such meeting or in any
                  such proceeding to receive or collect for the benefit of the
                  Lenders and the Agent any cash or other assets of Maker
                  distributed, divided or applied by way of dividend or payment,
                  or any securities issued on account of any indebtedness
                  evidenced by this Note [(other than pursuant to conversion of
                  this Note as set forth on Schedule II)], and apply such cash
                  to or to hold such other assets or securities as collateral
                  for the Senior Indebtedness owed to such Lenders, and to apply
                  to such Senior Indebtedness any cash proceeds of any
                  realization upon such other assets or securities that the
                  Agent in its discretion elects to effect, until all of the
                  Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash,
                  rendering to the holder of this Note any surplus to which the
                  holder of this Note is then entitled.

                           (iv)     Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of
                  subparagraph (c)(iii) above, the holder of this Note shall be
                  entitled to receive and retain any securities of Maker or any
                  other corporation or other entity provided for by a plan or
                  reorganization or readjustment (x) the payment of which
                  securities is subordinate, at least to the extent provided in
                  this Note with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by this
                  Note, to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness under any such
                  plan of reorganization or readjustment, and (y) all other
                  terms of which are acceptable to the Lenders and the Agent.

                           (v)      At any such meeting of creditors or in the
                  event of any such case or proceeding, in each case referred to
                  in subparagraph (c)(iii) above, the holder of this Note shall
                  retain the right to vote or otherwise act with respect to the
                  indebtedness evidenced by this Note (including, without
                  limitation, the right to vote to accept or reject any plan of
                  partial or complete liquidation, reorganization, arrangement,
                  composition or extension); provided that the holder of this
                  Note


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                  shall not vote with respect to any such plan or take any other
                  action in any way so as to contest (x) the validity of any
                  Senior Indebtedness or any collateral therefor or guaranties
                  thereof, (y) the relative rights and duties of any holders of
                  any Senior Indebtedness established in any instruments or
                  agreements creating or evidencing any of the Senior
                  Indebtedness with respect to any such collateral or guaranties
                  or (z) the obligations and agreements of the holder of this
                  Note set forth in this Note, nor shall any such vote by the
                  holder of this Note be inconsistent with any vote of the
                  Agent, so long as any Senior Indebtedness is owed to the
                  Lenders.

                  (d)      The subordination provisions contained in this Note
         shall continue in full force and effect, and the obligations and
         agreements of the holder of this Note and Maker hereunder shall
         continue to be fully operative, until all of the Senior Indebtedness
         shall have been paid and satisfied in full in cash and such full
         payment and satisfaction shall be final and not avoidable. To the
         extent that Maker or any guarantor of, or provider of collateral for,
         the Senior Indebtedness makes any payment on the Senior Indebtedness
         that is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
         preferential or set aside or is required to be repaid to a trustee,
         receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or
         reorganization act, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause
         (such payment being hereinafter referred to as a "Voided Payment"),
         then to the extent of such Voided Payment, that portion of the Senior
         Indebtedness that had been previously satisfied by such Voided Payment
         shall be revived and continue in full force and effect as if such
         Voided Payment had never been made. In the event that a Voided Payment
         is recovered from the Agent or any Lender, an Event of Default shall be
         deemed to have existed and to be continuing under the Credit Agreement
         from the date of such Agent's or such Lender's initial receipt of such
         Voided Payment until the full amount of such Voided Payment is restored
         to the Agent or such Lender. During any continuance of such Event of
         Default, the subordination provisions of this Note shall be in full
         force and effect with respect to the indebtedness evidenced by this
         Note.

                  (e)      Subject to the payment in full in cash of all Senior
         Indebtedness as aforesaid, the holder of this Note shall be subrogated
         to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive payments
         or distributions of any kind or character, whether in cash, property,
         stock or obligations, which may be payable or deliverable to the
         holders of Senior Indebtedness, until the principal of, and interest
         on, this Note shall be paid in full, and, as between Maker, its
         creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the holder
         of this Note, no such payment or distribution made to the holders of
         Senior Indebtedness by virtue of this Schedule I which otherwise would
         have been made to the holder of this Note shall be deemed a payment by
         Maker on account of the Senior Indebtedness, it being understood that
         the provisions of this Schedule I are intended solely for the purposes
         of defining the relative rights of the holder of this Note, on the one
         hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.
         Subject to the rights, if any, under this Schedule I of holders of
         Senior Indebtedness to receive cash, property, stock or obligations
         otherwise payable or deliverable to the holder of this Note, nothing
         herein shall either impair, as between Maker and the holder of this
         Note, the obligation of Maker, which is unconditional and absolute, to
