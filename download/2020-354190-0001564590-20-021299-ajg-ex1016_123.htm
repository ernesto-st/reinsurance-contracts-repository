Gallagher &amp; Co. (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, the &#8220;<font style="text-decoration:underline;">Company</font>&#8221;), to remain employed with the Company until at least age 62. The retention of key employees promotes the interests of the Company and its stockholders by providing continuity of management and leadership and by capitalizing on the investments the Company has made in its key employees over the years. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;margin-bottom:12pt;margin-top:0pt;text-indent:7.69%;font-size:12pt;font-family:Times New Roman;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-transform:none;font-variant: normal;">In the event that a Participant&#8217;s Account is deemed invested in shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $1.00 per share (&#8220;<font style="text-decoration:underline;">Common Stock</font>&#8221;), such shares of Common Stock will either be contributed to the trustee of the Trust (as defined below) by the Company, in which case they will be deemed to have been distributed under the Arthur J. Gallagher &amp; Co. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time, or any successor plan adopted by the Company and approved by its stockholders (the &#8220;<font style="text-decoration:underline;">LTIP</font>&#8221;), and will count against the limit on the number of shares of Common Stock available for distribution thereunder, or such shares shall have been purchased by the trustee of the Trust on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, as a result of an irrevocable election by the Participant, and shall not be deemed to have been distributed under the LTIP.</p>

The Trust is intended to be a &#8220;grantor trust&#8221; under the Code and the establishment of the Trust or the utilization of the Trust for Plan benefits, as applicable, is not intended to cause any Participant to realize current income on amounts contributed thereto, and the Trust shall be so interpreted. Any such funds will be subject to the claims of all bankruptcy or insolvency creditors of the Company as provided in the Trust agreement. No Participant will have any vested interest or secured or preferred position with respect to such funds or have any claims against the Company hereunder except as a general creditor.</font></p>

Alternatively, the Company may contribute cash to the Trust and instruct the trustee to acquire a specified number of shares or a specified value of shares of Common Stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall exercise all rights of ownership, including voting control, of the Trust assets prior to distribution under the Plan.</font></p>

At any time, the Committee may, in its discretion, add one or more additional Investments under the Plan. In addition, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may discontinue any Investment at any time, and provide for the portions of Participants&#8217; Accounts designated to the discontinued Investment to be reallocated to another Investment. While a Participant&#8217;s Account does not represent the Participant&#8217;s ownership of, or any ownership interest in, any particular assets, the Participant&#8217;s Account shall be adjusted in accordance with the Investment(s), subject to the conditions and procedures set forth herein or established by the Committee from time to time. Any notional cash earnings generated under an Investment (such as interest and cash dividends and distributions) shall, at the Committee&#8217;s sole discretion, either be deemed to be reinvested in that Investment or reinvested in one or more other Investment(s) designated by the Committee. All notional acquisitions and dispositions of Investments under a Participant&#8217;s Account shall be deemed to occur at such times as the Committee shall determine to be administratively feasible in its sole discretion and the Participant&#8217;s Account shall be adjusted accordingly. In addition, a Participant&#8217;s Account may be adjusted from time to time, in accordance with procedures and practices established by the Committee, in its sole discretion, to reflect any notional transactional costs and other fees and expenses relating to the deemed investment, disposition or carrying of any Investment for the Participant&#8217;s Account.</font></p>

Each Participant authorizes them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering and managing the Participant&#8217;s participation in the Plan, including any requisite transfer of such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of shares of stock on the Participant&#8217;s behalf to a broker or other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any shares of stock acquired pursuant to the Plan.
