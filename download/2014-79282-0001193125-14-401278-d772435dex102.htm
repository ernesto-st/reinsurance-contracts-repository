employment any employee or independent contractor of the Company, and further agrees that the Executive will not seek to induce any such person to terminate employment or engagement with the Company for any reason, including to work for Executive or

business combination by Company with or into any business entity. Executive further agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement for benefit of the Company to whose employ Executive may be transferred, without the necessity that this
Agreement or another employment agreement be re-executed at the time of such transfer. No assignment, consent by Executive, or notice to Executive shall be required to render this Agreement enforceable by any assignee, transferee, or successor. The
Company&#146;s assignees, transferees, or successors are expressly authorized to enforce the Company&#146;s rights and privileges hereunder, including the restrictive covenants set forth in Section&nbsp;5. Executive&#146;s services hereunder are
personal in nature, and Executive may not assign or delegate Executive&#146;s rights or obligations hereunder in whole or in part without the Company&#146;s prior written consent. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and

Executive&#146;s, this Agreement shall be deemed modified to provide Executive with all terms and benefits necessary to provide Executive with equivalent terms and benefits to those of the similar executives. For purposes of this clause, a
&#147;change of control&#148; means that the holders of more than 50% of the voting stock of Company before the transaction closes hold less than 50% of the voting stock of Company after the transaction closes. </P>
