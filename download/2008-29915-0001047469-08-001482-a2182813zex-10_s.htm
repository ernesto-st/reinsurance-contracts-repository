<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except for Michigan Operations Hourly Employees who were not Actively at Work on January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan provides
coverage of one times (1X) your base annual salary rounded up to the next $1,000 for Salaried Employees and Hourly Employees whose collective bargaining unit has agreed to this plan. Michigan
Operations Hourly Employees who were not Actively at Work on January&nbsp;1, 2008 but continue to be on the payroll (for example due to a paid medical leave of absence) and were covered at 1/2X
prior to January&nbsp;1, 2008, may continue 1/2X coverage as long as they continue to be on the payroll. If they return to work, their coverage will increase to 1X when they are Actively at Work.
MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internal Revenue Code requires that the cost of Company-Paid Life Insurance in excess of $50,000 be reported as taxable income ("imputed income").
This imputed income will be reported on your W-2 Form in addition to your other taxable income. Former participants of The Dow Chemical Company Split Dollar Life Insurance Plan and the
Union Carbide Corporation Executive Life Insurance Plan are not eligible for the $50,000 exclusion. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
cost of your Company-Paid Life Insurance in excess of $50,000 is based on a Uniform Premium Table established by the federal government. If you are an Hourly Employee of
Michigan Operations, the cost of your combined Company-Paid Life and Employee-Paid Life in excess of $50,000 is taxable income and is determined based on the Uniform Premium
Table established by the federal government. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
your Company Paid Life coverage is greater than $50,000, and you want to decrease the amount of coverage from 1X to $50,000, you may elect to do so by contacting the HR Service
Center. Once coverage is reduced, it may not be reinstated. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You designate your beneficiary on the Company-Paid Life Beneficiary Designation form, available from the Intranet or the HR Service Center. A
contingent beneficiary is recommended. If you fail to name a beneficiary, MetLife may determine the beneficiary to be one or more of the following who survive you: </FONT></P>

you fail to name a beneficiary, instead of making payment to any of the above, MetLife may pay your estate. Any payment made by MetLife in good faith will discharge the Plan's and
MetLife's liability to the extent of such payment. </FONT></P>

may change your beneficiary whenever you choose by completing a beneficiary change form. Beneficiary changes are not effective until the date they are received by the U.S. Benefits

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dow pays the entire premium for the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. MetLife pays the benefits under an insurance policy. MetLife may combine the
experience for the policy with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable
experience under one or more coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy
dividends declared by MetLife for the Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan are used to reduce Dow's cost for the coverage in the same and prior years. </FONT></P>

to 80% of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and Employee-Paid Life Insurance benefits before death if certain requirements are met. Having access to life insurance proceeds at
this important time could help ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to apply for ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or
Employee-Paid Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up to 80&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $500,000) of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan, you may select the amount of your coverage in multiples of one-half times (1/2X) your base
annual salary up eight times (8X) your base annual pay. The Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan is a group term life insurance plan. The benefits are insured by a group term life insurance
policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim
for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan: Hampshire Chemical Corporation Hourly Optional Group Life
Insurance Program's Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan; ANGUS Chemical Company Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no
longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. As of January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Michigan Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's
Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan has been merged into the Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan. The Employee-Paid Life Insurance Plan is referred to in Chapter Two as
the "Plan". </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your contribution, made through post tax payroll deductions, is based on your annual base salary. In addition, your contribution is based on your age and whether
you are a "non-tobacco-user". As your age and salary change, your deductions will be automatically adjusted. You are considered a "non tobacco-user" by the Plan if
you have not used a tobacco product in the last 12&nbsp;months. If you quit using tobacco, you are considered a "non-tobacco-user" as of the first day of the month after you
complete 12 non-tobacco-using months. If you are a tobacco user, you are considered a tobacco user as of the first day you use tobacco. Administratively, you will not be adjusted to
tobacco user deductions until the first of the month following the tobacco use. A false or out of date statement regarding tobacco use may result in benefits not being paid. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are on a leave of absence approved by the Participating Employer that provides eligibility under this Plan, the Plan Administrator has the full discretion to make special
administrative arrangements as are necessary, such as deferring Employee contributions on a temporary basis during the leave of absence, and requiring the Employee to repay premiums when the Employee
returns to work, or any other arrangements the Plan Administrator deems appropriate. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the last payroll period for a Plan Year occurs partly during a current Plan Year and partly during the next Plan Year, the Plan Administrator has the full and complete discretion to
modify the Participant contributions in any way that the Plan Administrator deems administratively efficient, including modifying the Participant contributions for the last payroll period without the

will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each
death benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount
of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire amount of the claim. Neither
MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Accelerated Benefit Option (ABO), if you have been diagnosed as terminally ill with 12&nbsp;months or less to live, you may be eligible to receive up
to 80% of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and Employee-Paid Life Insurance benefits before death if certain requirements are met. Having access to life insurance proceeds at
this important time could help ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to apply for ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or
Employee-Paid Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up to 80&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $500,000) of your Company-Paid Life Insurance and/or
Employee-Paid Life Insurance benefit. An accelerated benefit is payable in a lump sum and can be elected only once. The death benefit will be reduced by the amount of accelerated benefit
paid. Accelerated benefits are not permitted if you have assigned your life insurance benefit to another individual or to a trust. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
accelerated life insurance benefits are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. If the accelerated benefits qualify for
such favorable tax treatment, the benefits will be excludable from your income and not subject to federal taxation. Payment of the accelerated benefit will be subject to state taxes and regulations.
Tax laws relating to accelerated benefits are complex. You are advised to consult with a qualified tax advisor. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipt
of accelerated benefits may affect your eligibility, or that of your spouse/domestic partner or your family, for public assistance programs such as medical assistance (Medicaid),
Aid to Families and Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and drug assistance programs. You are advised to consult with social services agencies concerning the effect receipt
of accelerated benefits will have on public assistance eligibility for you, your spouse/domestic partner or your family. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you would like to apply for the Accelerate Benefit Option, a claim form can be obtained from the HR Service Center at 1-877-623-8079 and must be

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dependent Life Insurance Plan provides coverage for your eligible family members at group rates. The benefits are insured by a group term life insurance
policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife). MetLife pays the benefits under the Plan. In addition, MetLife is the named fiduciary for making decisions as to whether a Claim
for Benefits is payable. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
of January&nbsp;1, 2005, the following plans have been merged into the Dependent Life Insurance Plan: Hampshire Chemical Corporation Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's
Dependent Life Insurance Plan; ANGUS Chemical Company Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Dependent Life Insurance Plan. Such plans no longer exist as separate plans, but are now a part of
the Dependent Life Insurance Plan. As of January&nbsp;1, 2008, the Michigan Hourly Optional Group Life Insurance Program's Dependent Life Insurance Plan has been merged into the Dependent Life
Insurance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The

This feature allows employees to continue their Group Term Life coverage under a separate group policy without providing proof of insurability. Rates for this coverage are different from the active
plan rates and the employee must port a minimum of $20,000 to exercise this option. You have 31&nbsp;days from the date your coverage ends to apply for Portability. You may continue the same or
lesser amount of coverage. For Michigan residents, there is a limit to the amount of coverage you are allowed to port. If you are unable to continue your entire life insurance amount through

of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child lost may be converted to an individual non-term policy through MetLife. The maximum amount of insurance that may be elected for the

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child loses coverage under the Dependent Life Insurance Plan because of your death or because he or she no longer meets
eligibility requirements, their coverage may be converted to an individual non-term policy through MetLife. (In the case of minor children, the parent or legal guardian may act on their
behalf.) The maximum amount of insurance that may be elected for the new policy is the amount of Dependent Life Insurance that ends under the Dependent Life Insurance provisions of the MetLife group

this arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco
will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each
death benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount
of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire amount of the claim. Neither

at this important time could help ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to apply for ABO, your Spouse/Domestic Partner must be covered for at least $10,000 under the Dependent Life
Insurance Plan. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up to 80&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000) of the Spouse/Domestic Partner Dependent Life Insurance benefit. An accelerated benefit is payable in
a lump sum and can be elected only once. The death benefit will be reduced by the amount of accelerated benefit paid. Accelerated benefits are not permitted if you have assigned your life insurance
benefit to another individual or to a trust. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
accelerated life insurance benefits are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Tax laws relating to accelerated benefits are
complex. You are advised to consult with a qualified tax advisor. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Receipt
of accelerated benefits may affect your eligibility, or that of your spouse/domestic partner or your family, for public assistance programs such as medical assistance (Medicaid),
Aid to Families and Dependent Children (AFDC), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and drug assistance programs. You are advised to consult with social services agencies concerning the effect receipt
of accelerated benefits will have on public assistance eligibility for you, your spouse/domestic partner or your family. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you would like to apply for the Accelerate Benefit Option, a claim form can be obtained from the HR Service Center at 1-877-623-8079 and must be

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are a participant in the Company-Paid, Employee-Paid or Dependent Life Insurance Plans, you are entitled to certain rights and
protections under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law requires that all Plan participants must be able to: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Examine,
without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, the Plan Documents and the latest annual reports filed with the U.S. Department
of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Obtain,
upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of the Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions. The Administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the
copies.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='font-family:times;margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>Receive
a summary of each Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary annual report. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must
file&nbsp;a written appeal within the time period specified in the Plan's Claims Procedures. Failure to comply with the Plan's claims procedures may significantly jeopardize your rights to benefits.
If you are not satisfied with the final appellate decision, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within 120&nbsp;days from the
date of the Claims Administrator's or the Plan Administrator's final written decision (or the deadline the Claims Administrator or Plan Administrator had to notify you of a decision). Failure to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The court will decide who should pay court costs and
legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds
your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse one of the Plan's money, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within
120&nbsp;days from the date of the alleged misuse. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will
result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you feel that anyone is discriminating against you for exercising your rights under this benefit plan, or if you feel that someone has interfered with the attainment of any right to
which you feel you are entitled under any of the Plans, you must notify the Plan Administrator listed in the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ERISA Information</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" section of this SPD in
writing within 120&nbsp;days of the date of the alleged wrongdoing. The Plan Administrator will investigate the allegation and respond to you in writing within 120&nbsp;days. If the Plan
Administrator determines that your allegation has merit, the Plan Administrator will either correct the wrong, if it was the Plan which did the wrong, or will make a recommendation to the Plan Sponsor
or Participating Employer if any of them have been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation is without merit, you may appeal the Plan
Administrator's decision. You must submit written notice of your appeal to the Plan Administrator within 60&nbsp;days of receipt of the Plan Administrator's decision. Your appeal will be reviewed
and you will receive a written response within 60&nbsp;days. If you are not satisfied with the Plan Administrator's response to your appeal, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within

Directors. Certain modifications or amendments of the Plan which the Company deems necessary or appropriate to conform the Plan to, or satisfy the conditions of, any law, governmental regulation or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>A
"Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>A
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>An
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a Participant or covered
Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>
</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to your
situation. See the applicable sections below entitled </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR ELIGIBILITY
DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the U.S. Benefits Center. If you
appeal, the appellate decision is made by the North America Compensation&nbsp;&amp; Benefits Leader. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act on Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized
Representative" if such person submits a notarized document signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order
stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority of the Administrators and Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their
respective Claims decision-making responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Claims that are requests for Plan benefits, the claimant must complete a MetLife claims form. Call the HR Service Center at
1-877/623-8079 to obtain a form. (Retirees should call the Retiree Service Center to obtain a form at 1-800/344-0661). In addition, you must attach a
<U>certified</U> death certificate (must be certified by the government authority, as exhibited by a "raised seal" on the certificate). You may request assistance from the U.S.
Benefits Center (1-989/636-9556) if you need help completing the MetLife claims form. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may submit any additional information to the applicable Administrator when you submit your request for appeal. You may also request that the Administrator provide you copies of
documents, records and other information that is relevant to your Claim, as determined by the applicable Administrator under applicable federal regulations. Your request must be in writing. Such
information will be provided at no cost to you. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the applicable Administrator receives your written request to appeal the initial determination, the Administrator will review your Claim. Deference will not be given to the initial
adverse decision, and the appellate reviewer will look at the Claim anew. The person who will review your appeal will not be the same person as the person who made the initial decision to deny the
Claim. In addition, the person who is reviewing the appeal will not be a subordinate who reports to the person who made the initial decision to deny the Claim. The Administrator will notify you in
writing of its final decision. Such notification will be provided within a reasonable period, not to exceed 60&nbsp;days of the written request for appellate review, except that under special
circumstances, the Administrator may have up to an additional 60&nbsp;days to provide written notification of the final decision. If the Administrator needs such an extension, it will notify you
prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, state the reason why such an extension is needed, and indicate when it will make its determination. If the Administrator determines that it
does not have sufficient information to make a decision on the Claim prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, it will notify you. It will describe any additional material or
information necessary to submit to the Plan, and provide you with the deadline for submitting such information. The initial 60&nbsp;day time period for the Administrator to make a final written
decision, plus the 60&nbsp;day extension period (if applicable) are tolled from the date the notification of insufficiency is sent to you until the date on which it receives your response. ("Tolled"
means the "clock or time is stopped or suspended". In other words, the deadline for the Administrator to make its decision is "put on hold" until it receives the requested information). The tolling
