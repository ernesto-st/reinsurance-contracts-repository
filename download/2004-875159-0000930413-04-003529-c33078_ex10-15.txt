                    Purchase Price and the Initial Net Premium Receivable, the
                    line items listed on such SCHEDULE A shall be deemed to be
                    the amounts set forth in such SCHEDULE A;

          provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement (other than the
          determination of the Initial Net Reserves Amount and the Initial Net
          Premium Receivable) shall affect the determination of the Seasoned Net
          Reserves Amount or the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Balance,

                       PREMIUM SEASONING - SPA AMENDMENTS

DEFINITIONS

"SEASONED NET PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE BALANCE" means the sum of:

(i)  the INITIAL NET PREMIUM RECEIVABLE, being US$ 744,266,300, calculated as
     follows:

     (a)  the premiums and insurance balances receivable (net of bad debt
          provisions) as shown in Schedule A to the Agreement of which this
          Schedule forms part ("SCHEDULE A") less reinsurance balances payable
          and funds held under reinsurance agreements as shown in Schedule A;
          less

     (b)  29% of the aggregate of the unearned premium as shown in Schedule A
          less the prepaid reinsurance premiums as shown in Schedule A; plus

     (c)  the deferred acquisition costs as shown in Schedule A;

     For the avoidance of doubt this is calculated as follows:

     US$'000's 1,350,587 - 501,039 - 6,762 - (29% *(824,286-264,556)) + 63,802 =
     744,266.

          (ii) plus any positive, or, as the case may be, less any negative
               adjustment calculated as follows:

     (a)  71% of the aggregate of:

          (i)  the unearned premium less the prepaid reinsurance premiums in
               each case to the extent solely relating to Relevant Operations,
               as determined in accordance with US GAAP and as identified as at
               the End Date calculated as at the Effective Time; less

          (ii) the unearned premiums as shown in Schedule A less the prepaid
               reinsurance premiums as shown in Schedule A;

          plus

     (b)  the aggregate of:

          (i)  the premiums and insurance balances receivable (net of bad debt
               provisions and, for the avoidance of doubt, net of any
               commissions) less reinsurance balances payable and funds held
               under reinsurance agreements (and for the avoidance of doubt,
               this amount is net of any commissions) in each case to the extent
               relating solely to the Relevant Operations, as determined in
               accordance with US GAAP identified as at the End Date; less

          (ii) the unearned premium less the prepaid reinsurance premiums in
               each case to the extent solely relating to Relevant Operations,
               as determined in accordance with US GAAP and as identified as at
               the End Date calculated as at the Effective Time; plus
<PAGE>


         (iii) the deferred  acquisition costs in each case to the extent solely
               relating to Relevant Operations, as determined in accordance with
               US GAAP and as identified as at the End Date calculated as at the
               Effective Time

                  less

     (c)  US$ 346,858,000 being the aggregate of

          (i)  the premiums and insurance balances receivable (net of bad debt
               provisions and, for the avoidance of doubt, net of any
               commissions) less reinsurance balances payable and funds held
               under reinsurance agreements (and for the avoidance of doubt,
               this amount is net of any commissions) as shown in Schedule A;
               less

          (ii) the unearned premium less the prepaid reinsurance premiums as
               shown in Schedule A; plus

          (iii) the deferred acquisition costs as shown in Schedule A.

          For the avoidance of doubt item (ii)(c) has been calculated using
          Schedule A as follows:

          USD `000s (1,350,587 - 501,039 - 6,762) less (824,286 - 264,556) plus
          (63,802) = 346,858

for the avoidance of doubt, each of (ii)(a) and (ii)(b) can be negative as well
as positive.

In calculating the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Balance, the classification,
characterization or provision of any amount shall be consistent with the
classification, characterization or provision used in calculating the Initial
Net Premium Receivable.

                notice to XL Insurance stating that it disagrees with the
                Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Statement, together with
                reasons for the disagreement in reasonable detail and
                quantifying the amount of such disagreement (for the purpose of
                this Clause 4.4 the "WINTERTHUR DISAGREEMENT NOTICE"). In the
                absence of such notice within such period, the Seasoned Net

                parties for all purposes.

                within such 30 Business Days Winterthur and XL Insurance shall
                attempt in good faith to reach agreement in respect thereto. If

                within 10 Business Days of receipt by XL Insurance of the
                Winterthur Disagreement Notice then either Winterthur or XL
                Insurance may by notice in writing to the other require that the
                calculation of the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Balance be
                referred to the Independent Actuary (an "ACTUARY APPOINTMENT
                NOTICE"). Within 10 Business Days of receipt by a party of the
                Actuary Appointment Notice each of Winterthur and XL Insurance
                shall give written notice to the other and to the Independent
                Actuary of its proposed Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable
                Balance.

        4.4.6   The Independent Actuary shall be a member of the Casualty
                Actuarial Society ("CAS") or a Fellow of the Institute of
                Actuaries ("FIA") and shall be instructed to independently
                determine the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Balance in
                accordance with the principles and standards of practice of the
                CAS or the FIA as the case may be and the American Academy of
                Actuaries and to make its determination as soon as is reasonably
                practicable. The procedures of the Independent Actuary shall be
                determined by the Independent Actuary, but shall:

                (i)     give the parties a reasonable opportunity to make
                        written and oral representations to them;

                (ii)    require that the parties supply each other with a copy
                        of any written representations at the same time as they
                        are made to the Independent Actuary; and

                (iii)   permit each party to be present while oral submissions
                        are being made by any other party.

        4.4.7   The determination of the Independent Actuary shall be made in
                writing and sent to the parties at such time as it shall
                determine. The Independent Actuary shall act as an expert and
                not as an arbitrator and his or her determination shall be final
                and binding on the parties as provided in Clause 4.4.8.

        4.4.8   If the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Balance as determined by
                the Independent Actuary is closer to the amount proposed by XL
                Insurance than the amount proposed by Winterthur (in each case
                pursuant to the last sentence of Clause 4.4.5) then for the
                purpose of this Agreement the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable
                Balance shall be finally and conclusively deemed to be the
                amount so proposed by XL Insurance. If the Seasoned Net Premiums
                Receivable Balance as determined by the Independent Actuary is
                closer to the amount proposed by Winterthur than the amount
                proposed by XL Insurance (in each case pursuant to the last
                sentence of Clause 4.4.5) then for the purpose of this Agreement
                the Seasoned Net Premiums Receivable Balance shall be finally
                and conclusively deemed to be the amount so proposed by
                Winterthur

        4.4.9   The parties shall co-operate with the Independent Actuary and
                comply with its reasonable requests made in connection with the
                carrying out of its duties under this Agreement. In particular
                without limitation XL Insurance shall keep up-to-date and
                subject to reasonable notice make available to Winterthur,
                Winterthur's Accountants, Winterthur's Actuary and the

                relating to the Relevant Operations during normal business hours
                during the period from the appointment of the Independent
                Actuary down to the making of the determination by the
                Independent Actuary.

        4.4.10  Subject to Clause 4.4.11 nothing in this Clause 4.4 shall
                entitle a party or the Independent Actuary access to any
                information or document which is protected by legal professional
                privilege or any other legal obligation of confidentiality or
                which has been prepared by the other party or its accountants,
                actuaries and other professional advisers with a view to
                assessing the merits of any claim or argument.

        4.4.11  A party shall not be entitled by reason of Clause 4.4.10 to
                refuse to supply such part or parts of documents as contain only
                the facts on which the relevant claim or argument is based.

        4.4.12  Each party shall and shall procure that its accountants,
                actuaries and other advisers shall and shall instruct the
                Independent Actuary to keep all information and documents
                provided to them pursuant to this Clause 4.4 confidential and
