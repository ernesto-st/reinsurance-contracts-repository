   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In consideration of the promises set forth in this Agreement,  the parties agree
as follows:


Article I  -  SCOPE OF AGREEMENT

As a condition  precedent to the Reinsurer's  obligations  under this Agreement,
the  Company  shall  cede  to the  Reinsurer  the  business  described  in  this
Agreement,  and the Reinsurer shall accept such business as reinsurance from the
Company.

This Agreement is comprised of General Articles I through XII and the Exhibit(s)
listed below and each Exhibit  which may be made a part of this  Agreement.  The
terms of the General  Articles and of the Exhibit(s)  shall determine the rights
and obligations of the parties. The terms of the General Articles shall apply to
each Exhibit unless specifically amended therein. In the event of termination of
all the  Exhibits  made a part of this  Agreement,  the General  Articles  shall
automatically  terminate when the liability of the Reinsurer under said Exhibits
ceases.

         EXHIBIT A  -  EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE
                                       of
                            Other Liability Business

         EXHIBIT B  -  EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE
                                       of
                          Automobile Liability Business



<PAGE>

         EXHIBIT C  -  EXCESS OF LOSS REINSURANCE
                                       of
                                Property Business


Article II  -  PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT

This Agreement is solely  between the Company and the Reinsurer.  When more than
one Company is named as a party to this Agreement, the first Company named shall
be the  agent  of the  other  companies  as to all  matters  pertaining  to this
Agreement.  Performance  of the  obligations  of each party under this Agreement
shall be rendered  solely to the other party.  However,  if the Company  becomes
insolvent,  the liability of the  Reinsurer  shall be modified to the extent set
forth in the article  entitled  INSOLVENCY OF THE COMPANY.  In no instance shall
any  insured of the  Company or any  claimant  against an insured of the Company
have any rights under this Agreement.


Article III  -  MANAGEMENT OF CLAIMS AND LOSSES

The Company shall  investigate and settle or defend all claims and losses.  When
requested  by the  Reinsurer,  the Company  shall permit the  Reinsurer,  at the
expense of the  Reinsurer,  to be associated  with the Company in the defense or
control of any claim,  loss, or legal  proceeding which involves or is likely to
involve the  Reinsurer.  All payments of claims or losses by the Company  within
the terms and  limits of its  policies  which are within the limits set forth in
the applicable  Exhibit shall be binding on the Reinsurer,  subject to the terms
of this Agreement.


Article IV  -  RECOVERIES

The Company shall pay to or credit the Reinsurer with the Reinsurer's portion of
any recovery obtained from salvage, subrogation, or other insurance.  Adjustment
Expenses for recoveries shall be deducted from the amount recovered.

The Reinsurer  shall be subrogated to the rights of the Company to the extent of
its loss  payments to the Company.  The Company  agrees to enforce its rights of
salvage,  subrogation, and its rights against insurers or to assign these rights
to the Reinsurer.

If the reinsurance under an Exhibit is on a share basis, the recoveries shall be
apportioned  between  the  parties  in the same  ratio as the  amounts  of their
liabilities  bear to the loss.  If the  reinsurance  under an  Exhibit  is on an
excess basis, recoveries shall be distributed to the parties in an order inverse
to that in which their liabilities accrued.


Article V  -  PREMIUM REPORTS AND REMITTANCES

All reinsurance  premium reports required by the Exhibit(s)  attached hereto may
be sent to:

Article VI  -  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS

The  Reinsurer  shall  not be  relieved  of  liability  because  of an  error or
accidental  omission  of the  Company  in  reporting  any  claim  or loss or any
business reinsured under this Agreement,  provided that the error or omission is
rectified  promptly after  discovery.  The Reinsurer shall be obligated only for
the return of the premium paid for business  reported  but not  reinsured  under
this Agreement.


Article VII  -  SPECIAL ACCEPTANCES

Business  not  within  the  terms  of this  Agreement  may be  submitted  to the
Reinsurer for special  acceptance  and, if accepted by the  Reinsurer,  shall be
subject to all of the terms of this Agreement  except as modified by the special
acceptance.


Article VIII  -  RESERVES AND TAXES

The Reinsurer shall maintain the required reserves as to the Reinsurer's portion
of unearned premium, claims, losses, and adjustment expense.

The  Company  shall be liable  for all  premium  taxes on  premium  ceded to the
Reinsurer under this Agreement. If the Reinsurer is obligated to pay any premium
taxes on this premium,  the Company shall reimburse the Reinsurer;  however, the
Company shall not be required to pay taxes twice on the same premium.


Article IX  -  OFFSET

The  Company or the  Reinsurer  may offset  any  balance,  whether on account of
premium,   commission,   claims  or  losses,  Adjustment  Expense,  salvage,  or
otherwise,  due from one party to the other  under this  Agreement  or under any
other agreement heretofore or hereafter entered into between the Company and the
Reinsurer.

Article X  -  INSPECTION OF RECORDS

The Company  shall allow the  Reinsurer to inspect,  at  reasonable  times,  the
records of the Company relevant to the business  reinsured under this Agreement,
including  Company files concerning  claims,  losses, or legal proceedings which
involve or are likely to involve the Reinsurer.


Article XI  -  ARBITRATION

Any unresolved difference of opinion between the Reinsurer and the Company shall
be submitted to arbitration by three arbitrators. One arbitrator shall be chosen
by the Reinsurer,  and one shall be chosen by the Company.  The third arbitrator
shall be chosen by the other two  arbitrators  within  ten (10) days  after they
have  been  appointed.  If  the  two  arbitrators  cannot  agree  upon  a  third
arbitrator, each arbitrator shall nominate three persons of whom the other shall
reject two. The third arbitrator shall then be chosen by drawing lots. If either
party fails to choose an arbitrator  within thirty (30) days after receiving the
written  request  of the other  party to do so,  the latter  shall  choose  both
arbitrators,  who shall choose the third  arbitrator.  The arbitrators  shall be
impartial and shall be active or retired persons whose  principal  occupation is
or  was  as an  officer  of  property  and  casualty  insurance  or  reinsurance
companies.

The party requesting  arbitration (the  "Petitioner")  shall submit its brief to
the  arbitrators  within  thirty (30) days after notice of the  selection of the
third arbitrator.  Upon receipt of the Petitioner's  brief, the other party (the
"Respondent")  shall have thirty (30) days to file a reply brief.  On receipt of
the  Respondent's  brief,  the Petitioner  shall have twenty (20) days to file a
rebuttal  brief.  Respondent  shall have  twenty  (20) days from the  receipt of
Petitioner's  rebuttal brief to file its rebuttal  brief.  The  arbitrators  may
extend the time for filing of briefs at the request of either party.

The  arbitrators  are relieved  from  judicial  formalities  and, in addition to
considering  the rules of law and the customs and practices of the insurance and
reinsurance business, shall make their award with a view to effecting the intent
of this Agreement.  The decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon
the parties.  The costs of arbitration,  including the fees of the  arbitrators,
shall be shared equally unless the arbitrators decide otherwise. The arbitration
shall be held at the times and places agreed upon by the arbitrators.


Article XII  -  INSOLVENCY OF THE COMPANY

In the event of the insolvency of the Company,  the reinsurance proceeds will be
paid to the  Company or the  liquidator  on the basis of the amount of the claim
allowed  in the  insolvency  proceeding  without  diminution  by  reason  of the
inability of the Company to pay all or part of the claim.




                                      -4-
<PAGE>

The  Reinsurer  shall be given  written  notice of the  pendency  of each  claim
against the Company on the policy(ies)  reinsured  hereunder within a reasonable
time after  such claim is filed in the  insolvency  proceedings.  The  Reinsurer
shall have the right to investigate each such claim and to interpose, at its own
expense,  in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated,  any defenses
which it may deem available to the Company or its  liquidator.  The expense thus
incurred  by the  Reinsurer  shall be  chargeable,  subject  to court  approval,
against  the  insolvent  Company as part of the  expense of  liquidation  to the
extent of a  proportionate  share of the benefit which may accrue to the Company
solely as a result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.


IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed
in duplicate,

                to the extent set forth in the article  entitled  INSOLVENCY  OF
                THE COMPANY.

                Notwithstanding   the   provisions   of  the  article   entitled

                terms of its  policies  in the  direct  defense of claims and as
                allocated to an individual  claim or loss (other than for office
                expenses  and for the  salaries and expenses of employees of the
                Company or of any  subsidiary or related or wholly owned company

                part of the settlement, verdict, award, or judgment.

        (e)     Losses  in  Excess  of  Policy  Limits  and  Extra   Contractual
                Obligations

                (1)   The term  "Loss in Excess of Policy  Limits"  shall mean a
                      payment  made to a third  party  claimant in excess of the
                      policy limit which the Company is legally obligated to pay
                      resulting  from an action taken by the insured or assignee
                      arising  from a third  party  claimant  being  awarded  an
                      amount in excess of the Company's policy limit as a result
                      of the Company's failure to settle within the policy limit
                      or of the  Company's  alleged or actual  negligence or bad
                      faith  in  rejecting  an  offer  of  settlement  or in the
                      preparation  of the  defense or in the trial of any action
                      against its insured or in the  preparation  or prosecution
                      of an appeal consequent upon such action.

                (2)   The term "Extra Contractual  Obligation" shall mean a loss
                      which the Company is legally  obligated  to pay,  which is
                      not covered under any other  provision of this Exhibit and
                      which arises from the  Company's  handling of any claim on
                      the  policies  reinsured  hereunder  which have  limits of
                      liability greater than the Company Retention.

                The date on which a Loss in Excess of Policy  Limits or an Extra
                Contractual  Obligation  is  incurred  by the  Company  shall be
                deemed,  in all  circumstances,  to be the date of the  original
                Occurrence.

                There shall be no coverage hereunder where the Loss in Excess of
                the Policy Limit or the Extra  Contractual  Obligation  has been
                incurred due to the fraud or criminal conduct of a member of the
                Board of Directors,  a corporate officer of the Company,  or any
                other   employee  of  the  Company,   acting   individually   or
                collectively  or in collusion with any individual or corporation
                or  any   other   organization   or   party   involved   in  the
                investigation,  defense  or  settlement  of  any  claim  covered
                hereunder.

                Any insurance or reinsurance,  whether collectible or not, which
                indemnifies or protects the Company against claims which are the
                subject  matter  of  this   definition  and  any   contribution,
                subrogation,  or  recovery  shall  inure to the  benefit  of the
                Reinsurer  and shall be  deducted to arrive at the amount of the
                Company's Net Loss.

         (f)    Occurrence

                This term shall mean each  accident or  occurrence  or series of
                accidents  or  occurrences  arising  out of one  event,  whether
                involving one or several of the Company's  policies.  All bodily
                injury,  personal injury,  advertising injury or property damage
                arising out of continuous or repeated  exposure to substantially

                interim  statement of contingent  commission for the period from

                subrogation,  or  recovery  shall  inure to the  benefit  of the

</TABLE>

All insurance written under one or more policies of the Company against the same
peril on the same Risk shall be  combined,  and the  Company  Retention  and the
Limit of Liability of the Reinsurer  shall be determined on the basis of the sum
of all  insurance  against the same peril and on the same Risk which is in force
at the time of a claim or loss.


Section 4  -  COMBINATION COVER

If an Occurrence  takes place which involves one Property Risk  reinsured  under
this Exhibit and the Other Liability  business  reinsured under Exhibit A or the
Automobile  Liability  business  reinsured under Exhibit B in  combination,  the
provisions  of the section  entitled  COMBINATION  COVER of said Exhibit A shall
apply.


Section 5  -  OTHER REINSURANCE

The obligations of the Company to reinsure  business falling within the scope of
this Exhibit and of the Reinsurer to accept such  reinsurance  are mandatory and
no other  reinsurance  (either  facultative  or treaty) is permitted,  except as
provided for below.

When the amount of  insurance  written  by the  Company  on an  individual  Risk
exceeds  $2,000,000,  permission is granted the Company to purchase  facultative
excess of loss or share  reinsurance  for the excess amount on such Risk. If the
Company purchases  facultative  excess of loss  reinsurance,  it shall apply the
Supplemental  Rates set forth in Appendix A attached hereto. If the Company does
not purchase  either  facultative  excess of loss or share  reinsurance  for the
excess  amount on such  Risk,  the Net Loss for the  purpose  of  computing  the
Company  Retention and the Limit of Liability of the Reinsurer  shall be reduced
as if facultative  share  reinsurance  had been in force at the time of the loss
for the excess amount on such Risk.

The  Company  may  also  purchase  facultative  excess  of loss  reinsurance  or
facultative share reinsurance within the liability of the Reinsurer,  if, in the
underwriting  judgment of the Company,  the Reinsurer will be benefited thereby.
In no event,  however,  shall the amount  required  with  respect to the Company
Retention be reduced.




                                     C - 33

Recoveries from catastrophe reinsurance shall be deemed not to reduce the amount
required with respect to the Company Retention.


Section 6  -  DEFINITIONS

         (a)    Company Retention

                This term shall mean the amount the Company shall retain for its
                own account;  however,  this  requirement  shall be satisfied if
                this  amount  is  retained  by the  Company  or  its  affiliated
                companies under common management or common ownership.

         (b)    Net Loss

                losses, including Adjustment Expense, after deduction of salvage
                and other recoveries and after deduction of amounts due from all
                other  reinsurance,  except  catastrophe  reinsurance,   whether
                collectible  or not.  If the  Company  becomes  insolvent,  this
                definition  shall be  modified  to the  extent  set forth in the
                article entitled INSOLVENCY OF THE COMPANY.

                Notwithstanding   the   provisions   of  the  article   entitled
                MANAGEMENT  OF CLAIMS AND LOSSES,  this term shall also  include
                80% of Extra Contractual Obligations.

         (c)    Adjustment Expense

                This term  shall mean  expenditures  by the  Company  within the
                terms of its  policies  in the  direct  defense of claims and as
                allocated to an individual  claim or loss (other than for office
                expenses  and for the  salaries and expenses of employees of the
                Company or of any  subsidiary or related or wholly owned company
                of the Company) made in  connection  with the  disposition  of a

                negotiation,   and  legal  expenses;  court  costs;  Prejudgment
                Interest or Delayed  Damages;  and  interest on any  judgment or
                award.

         (d)    Prejudgment Interest or Delayed Damages

                This term shall mean  interest or damages added to a settlement,
                verdict, award, or judgment based on the amount of time prior to
                the settlement,  verdict, award, or judgment whether or not made
                part of the settlement, verdict, award, or judgment.

         (e)    Extra Contractual Obligations

                This  term  shall  mean a loss  which  the  Company  is  legally
                obligated to pay, which is not covered under any other provision
                of this Exhibit and which arises from the Company's  handling of
                any claim on the policies reinsured hereunder which have amounts
                of insurance greater than the Company Retention.

                The date on which an extra contractual obligation is incurred by
                the Company  shall be deemed,  in all  circumstances,  to be the
                date of the original Occurrence.

                There shall be no coverage hereunder where the extra contractual
                obligation  has  been  incurred  due to the  fraud  or  criminal
                conduct  of a member  of the  Board of  Directors,  a  corporate
                officer of the  Company,  or any other  employee of the Company,
                acting  individually  or  collectively  or in collusion with any
                individual or  corporation  or any other  organization  or party
                involved  in the  investigation,  defense or  settlement  of any
                claim covered hereunder.

                Any insurance or reinsurance,  whether collectible or not, which
                indemnifies or protects the Company against claims which are the
                subject  matter  of  this   definition  and  any   contribution,
                subrogation,  or  recovery  shall  inure to the  benefit  of the
                Reinsurer  and shall be  deducted to arrive at the amount of the
                Company's Net Loss.

         (f)    Risk

                The Company shall establish what constitutes one Risk, provided:

                (1)   a  Building  and  its  contents,  including  time  element
                      coverages, shall never be considered more than one Risk;

                (2)   when two or more Buildings and their contents are situated
                      at the same general  location,  the Company shall identify
                      on its  records at the time of  acceptance  by the Company
                      those  individual  Buildings  and their  contents that are
                      considered to constitute each Risk; if such identification
                      is not  made,  each  Building  and its  contents  shall be
                      considered to be a separate Risk.

                This term shall mean each  structure  that is  considered by the
                local  fire  insurance  rating  organization  to  be a  separate
                building for rate making purposes.  With reference to structures
                not  rated  specifically  by the  local  fire  insurance  rating
                organization,  the term  Building  shall  mean  each  separately
                roofed structure enclosed within exterior walls.

         (h)    Occurrence

                This term shall mean each  occurrence  or series of  occurrences

                business  reinsured  under this Exhibit,  after deduction of the
                premium paid for reinsurance which inures to the benefit of this
                Exhibit.

                For  purposes  of this  Exhibit,  Subject  Written  Premium  for
                businessowners  shall be deemed  to be 60% of the  total  policy
                premium.

                its  successors  or  assigns,  which  has been  declared  by any

                are covered under Insurance Services Office wordings promulgated
                on or after April 1, 1986.  Nevertheless,  if the insured elects

                Office wordings;

                some other party,  notwithstanding  that no legal  liability may
                arise in respect thereof by reason of the fact that the Company,

To induce a mortgagee  named in a policy of the  Company to accept such  policy,
the Company and the Reinsurer may agree to name such  mortgagee as a third party
beneficiary in a Mortgagee Reinsurance  Endorsement made a part of this Exhibit.
For each such Mortgagee  Reinsurance  Endorsement  so issued,  the Company shall
indemnify the Reinsurer for any and all  liability,  loss,  cost, or expense the
Reinsurer may sustain or incur in excess of its  obligations  under this Exhibit
by reason of the issuance of such Mortgagee Reinsurance Endorsement.

If the Reinsurer  becomes liable to a mortgagee under any Mortgagee  Reinsurance
Endorsement, the Reinsurer shall, to the extent of its liability:

        (a)     Benefit pro-rata in reductions of the Company's loss by salvage,
                subrogation, compromise, or otherwise.

        (b)     Be  automatically  subrogated to all of the  mortgagee's  rights
                against the Company under the policy.

        (c)     Be completely discharged from its obligation to make any payment
                to the  Company  under this  Exhibit  and be entitled to set off
                against any amount due from the  Reinsurer to the Company  under
                this or any  other  agreement  for any  amounts  for  which  the
                Reinsurer  would not be liable  except for the existence of such
                Mortgagee Reinsurance Endorsement.

The  Reinsurer  shall  have  the  right  to  cancel  any  Mortgagee  Reinsurance
Endorsement by notice to the mortgagee."
