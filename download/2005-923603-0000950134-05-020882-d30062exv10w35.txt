            SECTION 2.02. Making the Term Advances. (a) Each Borrowing shall
be made on notice, given not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the
third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, or not later than 1:00 P.M.

in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial
Interest Period for each such Term Advance, and (vi) the account information for
the Borrower Account to which such Borrowing should be credited. Each Lender
shall, before 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing in
the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances and 1:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing
consisting of Base Rate Advances, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing in accordance with the respective Term Commitments of such Lender and

upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the applicable Borrower
by crediting the applicable Borrower Account.

            (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) the Borrowers may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for
the initial Borrowing hereunder or for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of

Borrowings outstanding at any time.

                                       25
<PAGE>

            (c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrowers. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing
specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrowers shall
indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender
as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such
Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred
by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired
by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such
Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such
date.

            (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
a Lender prior to (x) the date of any Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Advances or (y) 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of any Borrowing
consisting of Base Rate Advances that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the applicable Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of any Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at such time under Section 2.06 to Term Advances comprising such
Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such
amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Term Advance as part of such
Borrowing for all purposes.

            (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Term Advance to be made by
it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Term Advance on the date of such
Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to make the Term Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of
any Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.03. Repayment of Term Advances. The Borrowers shall repay
to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Term Advances then outstanding on the
following dates in the amounts indicated (which amounts shall be reduced (a) as
a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order or
priority set forth in Section 2.05, and (b) to take into account any reduction
in the Term Commitments pursuant to Section 2.04(b) resulting from the failure
of the aggregate principal amount of Borrowings drawn during the Draw Period to
equal the Maximum Facility Amount, as determined by the Administrative Agent (it
being acknowledged that the payment amounts set forth below are intended to
reflect amortization based on a 25-year schedule applied to the aggregate
principal amount of Borrowings drawn during the Draw Period):

provided, however, that (i) the final principal installment shall be repaid on
the Maturity Date in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
Term Advances outstanding on such date, and (ii) if the Maturity Date shall be
extended pursuant to Section 2.15, the foregoing amortization schedule shall be
adjusted by the Administrative Agent to reflect such extension, and (subject to
the provisions of Sections 2.04, 2.05 and 6.01), the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all Term Advances shall be repaid on the Maturity Date as so
extended.

            SECTION 2.04. Mandatory Termination or Reduction of the Term
Commitments. (a) Upon each repayment or prepayment of the Term Advances, the
Term Facility shall be automatically and permanently reduced, on a pro rata
basis, by an amount equal to the amount by which the aggregate Term Commitments
immediately prior to such reduction exceed the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Term Advances outstanding after giving effect to such repayment or
prepayment of the Term Advances. Each such reduction shall be allocated ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their Term Commitments. Upon any reduction
of the Term Facility to zero, the Term Commitments shall be automatically
terminated.

            (b) On the last day of the Draw Period, following the funding by the
Lenders of any Advances made on such date in accordance with Section 2.02, each
Lender's Term Commitment shall be automatically and permanently reduced by the
amount of such Lender's Unused Commitment.

            SECTION 2.05. Prepayments. (a) Optional. The Borrowers may, upon
same day notice in the case of Base Rate Advances and two Business Days' notice
in the case of Eurodollar Rate Advances, in each case to the Administrative
Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the
prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrowers shall, prepay the
outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Term Advances comprising part of
the same Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest
to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount prepaid;
provided, however, that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount of $1,000,000 or an integral multiple of $250,000 in excess
thereof or, if less, the amount of the Term Advances outstanding and (ii) if any
prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance is made on a date other than the last
day of an Interest Period for such Term Advance, the Borrowers shall also pay
any amounts owing pursuant to Section 9.04(c). Each such prepayment of Term
Advances shall be applied to the installments thereof in inverse order of
maturity.

            (b) Mandatory. In accordance with Section 5.02(e), the Borrowers
shall, upon the receipt of Net Sales Proceeds from the Transfer of any Hotel
Asset by any Borrower Party or any Subsidiary thereof, prepay a principal amount
of Term Advances equal to the amount of such Net Sales Proceeds; provided,
however that (A) TRS Guarantor and its Subsidiaries may exclude from the
mandatory prepayment required under this Section and distribute to FLLP an
aggregate amount not to exceed $36,000,000 of Net Sales Proceeds resulting from
the sale by TRS Guarantor and its Subsidiaries of Unencumbered Assets (the
"PERMITTED DISTRIBUTION"), and (B) any Net Sales Proceeds remaining after all
Term Advances have been prepaid in full may be retained by the applicable
Borrower Party or Subsidiary thereof. All prepayments under this subsection (b)
shall be made together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on
the principal amount prepaid. Each such prepayment of Term Advances shall be
applied to the installments thereof in inverse order of maturity.

                                       27
<PAGE>

            SECTION 2.06. Interest. (a) Scheduled Interest. The Borrowers shall
pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Term Advance owing to each
Lender from the date of such Term Advance until such principal amount shall be
paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

            (i) Base Rate Advances. During such periods as such Term Advance is
      a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of (A)
      the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus (B) the Applicable Margin
      in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day
      of each December, March, June and September during such periods and on the
      date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

            (ii) Eurodollar Rate Advances. During such periods as such Term
      Advance is a Eurodollar Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times
      during each Interest Period for such Term Advance to the sum of (A) the
      Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period for such Term Advance plus (B)
      the Applicable Margin in effect on the first day of such Interest Period,
      payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such
      Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that
      occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day
      of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurodollar Rate Advance shall
      be Converted or paid in full.

            (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default, the Borrowers shall pay interest on (i) the unpaid
principal amount of each Term Advance owing to each Lender, payable in arrears
on the dates referred to in clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above and on demand, at a
rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate per annum
required to be paid on such Term Advance pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, the amount of any
interest, fee or other amount payable under the Loan Documents that is not paid
when due, from the date such amount shall be due until such amount shall be paid
in full, payable in arrears on the date such amount shall be paid in full and on
demand, at a rate per annum equal at all times to 2% per annum above the rate
per annum required to be paid, in the case of interest, on the Type of Term
Advance on which such interest has accrued pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii)
above and, in all other cases, on Base Rate Advances pursuant to clause (a)(i)
above.

            (c) Notice of Interest Period and Interest Rate. Promptly upon
receipt of a Notice of Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(a), a notice of
Conversion pursuant to Section 2.09 or a notice of selection of an Interest
Period pursuant to the definition of "Interest Period", the Administrative Agent
shall give notice to the Borrowers and each Lender of the applicable Interest
Period and the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative Agent
for purposes of clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, and the applicable rate, if any,
furnished by the Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable
interest rate under clause (a)(ii) above.

            (d) Interest Rate Determination. If Telerate Page 3750 (or a
successor page) is unavailable and the Reference Bank fails to furnish timely
information to the Administrative Agent for determining the Eurodollar Rate for
any Eurodollar Rate Advances,

            (i) the Administrative Agent shall forthwith notify the Borrowers
      and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for such
      Eurodollar Rate Advances,

                                       28
<PAGE>

            (ii) each such Term Advance will automatically, on the last day of
      the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
      Advance (or if such Term Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will
      continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

            (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Term
      Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended until the
      Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that the
      circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

            SECTION 2.07. Fees. The Borrowers shall pay to each Agent for its
own account the fees, in the amounts and on the dates, set forth in the Fee
Letter and such other fees as may from time to time be agreed between the
Borrowers and such Agent.

            SECTION 2.08. Conversion of Term Advances. (a) Optional. The
Borrower may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Administrative Agent
not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior
to the date of the proposed Conversion and subject to the provisions of Sections
2.06 and 2.09, Convert all or any portion of the Term Advances of one Type
comprising the same Borrowing into Term Advances of the other Type; provided,
however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances
shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in
Section 2.02(b), no Conversion of any Term Advances shall result in more
separate Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b) and each Conversion of
Term Advances comprising part of the same Borrowing shall be made ratably among
the Lenders in accordance with their Term Commitments. Each such notice of
Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date
of such Conversion, (ii) the Term Advances to be Converted and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances, the duration of the initial
Interest Period for such Term Advances. Each notice of Conversion shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrowers.

            (b) Mandatory. (i) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be
reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $1,000,000, such
Term Advances shall automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

            (ii) If the applicable Borrower shall fail to select the duration of
any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the
provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders,
whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day
of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance.

            (iii) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, (y) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and
(z) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Term Advances into,
Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

            SECTION 2.09. Increased Costs, Etc. (a) If, due to either (i) the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make

                                       29
<PAGE>

or of making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate Advances (excluding, for
purposes of this Section 2.09, any such increased costs resulting from (y) Taxes
or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.11 shall govern) and (z) changes in the
basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United
States or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such
Lender is organized or has its Applicable Lending Office or any political
subdivision thereof), then the Borrowers shall from time to time, upon demand by
such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost; provided, however,
that a Lender claiming additional amounts under this Section 2.09(a) agrees to
use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal and
regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office if
the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.
A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the
Borrowers by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

      (b) If any Lender determines that compliance with any law or regulation or
any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital is increased by or
based upon the existence of such Lender's commitment to lend and other
commitments of such type (or similar contingent obligations), then, upon demand
by such Lender or such corporation (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender in the light of such
circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such
increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's commitment
to lend. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Borrowers by such
Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

            (c) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Required
Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Advances will not adequately reflect
the cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their Eurodollar Rate
Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so
notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each such Eurodollar Rate
Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the
Lenders to make, or to Convert Term Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances
shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrowers
that such Lenders have determined that the circumstances causing such suspension
no longer exist.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder,
then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by such Lender to the Borrowers
through the Administrative Agent, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Term Advances into, Eurodollar
Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrowers that such Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such
suspension no

                                       30
<PAGE>

longer exist; provided, however, that, before making any such demand, such
Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and
legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Eurodollar Lending
Office if the making of such a designation would allow such Lender or its
Eurodollar Lending Office to continue to perform its obligations to make
Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Advances and would not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender.

            SECTION 2.10. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrowers shall
make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any right of
counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12), not
later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars
to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account in same day
funds, with payments being received by the Administrative Agent after such time
being deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The
Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed
(i) if such payment by the Borrowers is in respect of principal, interest,
commitment fees or any other Obligation then payable hereunder and under the
Notes to more than one Lender, to such Lenders for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of
such respective Obligations then payable to such Lenders and (ii) if such
payment by the Borrowers is in respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder
to one Lender, to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office,
in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon
its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after
the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest
assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such
Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

            (b) Each Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender and each of such
Lender's Affiliates, if and to the extent payment owed to such Lender is not
made when due hereunder or, in the case of a Lender, under the Notes held by
such Lender, to charge from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, against any or all of such Borrower's accounts with such Lender any amount
so due.

            (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be
made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate
or the Federal Funds Rate and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent
on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days
(including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for
which such interest, fees or commissions are payable. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

            (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as
the case may be; provided, however, that if such extension would cause payment
of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next
following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

                                       31
<PAGE>

            (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to any Lender
hereunder that the Borrowers will not make such payment in full, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers have made such payment in
full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender on
such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the
extent the Borrowers shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such
Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

            (f) Whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full
all amounts due and payable to the Agents and the Lenders under or in respect of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent and applied by the Agents and the
Lenders in the following order of priority:

            (i) first, to the payment of all of the fees, indemnification
      payments, costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Agents
      (solely in their respective capacities as Agents) under or in respect of
      this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on such date, ratably based
      upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such fees, indemnification
      payments, costs and expenses owing to the Agents on such date;

            (ii) second, to the payment of all of the indemnification payments,
      costs and expenses that are due and payable to the Lenders under Section
      9.04 and any similar section of any of the other Loan Documents on such
      date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
      indemnification payments, costs and expenses owing to the Lenders on such
      date;

            (iii) third, to the payment of all of the amounts that are due and
      payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under Sections 2.09
      and 2.11 on such date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts
      thereof owing to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on such date;

            (iv) fourth, to the payment of all of the accrued and unpaid
      interest on the Obligations of the Borrower under or in respect of the
      Loan Documents that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent and the
      Lenders under Section 2.06(b) on such date, ratably based upon the
      respective aggregate amounts of all such interest owing to the
      Administrative Agent and the Lenders on such date;

            (v) fifth, to the payment of all of the accrued and unpaid interest
      on the Term Advances that is due and payable to the Administrative Agent
      and the Lenders under Section 2.06(a) on such date, ratably based upon the
      respective aggregate amounts of all such interest owing to the
      Administrative Agent and the Lenders on such date;

            (vi) sixth, to the payment of the principal amount of all of the
      outstanding Term Advances that are due and payable to the Lenders on such
      date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
      principal the Lenders on such date; and

                                       32
<PAGE>

            (vii) seventh, to the payment of all other Obligations of the Loan
      Parties owing under or in respect of the Loan Documents that are due and
      payable to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties on such
      date, ratably based upon the respective aggregate amounts of all such
      Obligations owing to the Administrative Agent and the other Secured
      Parties on such date.

            SECTION 2.11. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by any Loan Party to
or for the account of any Lender or any Agent hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.10 or the applicable
provisions of such other Loan Document, if any, free and clear of and without
deduction for any and all present or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions,
charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in
the case of each Lender and each Agent, taxes that are imposed on its overall
net income by the United States and taxes that are imposed on its overall net
income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or foreign
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or such Agent, as the case may
be, is organized or any political subdivision thereof and, in the case of each
Lender, taxes that are imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes
imposed in lieu thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender's
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof (all such
non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and
liabilities in respect of payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document
being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES"). If any Loan Party shall be required
by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or
under any other Loan Document to any Lender or any Agent, and unless such
requirement arises from the failure of a Lender to furnish the documentation
described in Section 2.11(e), (i) the sum payable by the such Loan Party shall
be increased as may be necessary so that after such Loan Party and any Agent
have made all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 2.11) such Lender or such Agent, as the case may
be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make all such deductions and
(iii) such Loan Party shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, each Loan Party shall pay any present or future
stamp, documentary, excise, property, intangible, mortgage recording or similar
taxes, charges or levies that arise from any payment made by such Loan Party
hereunder or under any other Loan Documents or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement, or the other Loan Documents (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER
TAXES").

            (c) The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender and each Agent for
and hold them harmless against the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes, and for
the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on
amounts payable under this Section 2.11, imposed on or paid by such Lender or
such Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including penalties,
additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto. This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such
Lender or such Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

            (d) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, within 30 days
after the date of any payment of Taxes, the appropriate Loan Party shall furnish
to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 9.02, the
original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment, to the extent
such receipt is issued therefor, or other evidence of payment thereof reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any payment hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents by or on behalf of a Loan Party through an
account or branch

                                       33
<PAGE>

outside the United States or by or on behalf of a Loan Party by a payor that is
not a United States person, if such Loan Party determines that no Taxes are
payable in respect thereof, such Loan Party shall furnish, or shall cause such
payor to furnish, to the Administrative Agent, at such address, an opinion of
counsel acceptable to the Administrative Agent stating that such payment is
exempt from Taxes. For purposes of subsections (d) and (e) of this Section 2.11,
the terms "UNITED STATES" and "UNITED STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings
specified in Section 7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

            (e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery
of this Agreement in the case of the Initial Lender, and on the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender in the case of
each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter as reasonably requested in
writing by the Borrowers (but only so long thereafter as such Lender remains
lawfully able to do so), provide each of the Administrative Agent and the
Borrowers with two original Internal Revenue Service Forms W8-BEN or W-8EC1, as
appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service, certifying that such Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced
rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Loan Document. If the forms provided by a Lender at the time such
Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement indicate a United States interest
withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be
considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender provides the
appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods
governed by such forms; provided, however, that if, at the effective date of the
Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender becomes a party to this
Agreement, the Lender assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) of
this Section 2.11 in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to
interest paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include
(in addition to withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other
amounts otherwise includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any,
applicable with respect to the Lender assignee on such date. If any form or
document referred to in this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of
information, other than information necessary to compute the tax payable and
information required on the date hereof by Internal Revenue Service form W8-BEN
or W8-EC1, that the applicable Lender reasonably considers to be confidential,
such Lender shall give notice thereof to the Borrowers and shall not be
obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.
Upon the request of the Borrowers, any Lender that is a United States person and
is not an exempt recipient for U.S. backup withholding purposes shall deliver to
the Borrowers two copies of Internal Revenue Service form W-9 (or any successor
form).

            (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to
provide the Borrowers with the appropriate form or other document described in
subsection (e) above (other than if such failure is due to a change in law, or
in the interpretation or application thereof, occurring after the date on which
a form or other document originally was required to be provided or if such form
or other document otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above), such
Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) of
this Section 2.11 with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason
of such failure; provided, however, that should a Lender become subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form or other document required hereunder,
the Loan Parties shall take such steps as such Lender shall reasonably request
to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

            (g) Any Lender claiming any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 2.11 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal
policy and legal and

                                       34
<PAGE>

regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Eurodollar Lending
Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the
amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not,
in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to such
Lender.

            (h) In the event that an additional payment is made under Section
2.11(a) or (c) for the account of any Lender and such Lender, in its sole
discretion, determines that it has finally and irrevocably received or been
granted a credit against or release or remission for, or repayment of, any tax
paid or payable by it in respect of or calculated with reference to the
deduction or withholding giving rise to such payment, such Lender shall, to the
extent that it determines that it can do so without prejudice to the retention
of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay to the
applicable Loan Party such amount as such Lender shall, in its sole discretion,
have determined to be attributable to such deduction or withholding and which
will leave such Lender (after such payment) in no worse position that it would
have been in if the applicable Loan Party had not been required to make such
deduction or withholding. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the
right of a Lender to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit
nor oblige any Lender to claim any tax credit or to disclose any information
relating to its affairs or any computations in respect thereof, and no Loan
Party shall be entitled to review the tax records of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent, or require any Lender to do anything that would prejudice
its ability to benefit from any other credits, reliefs, remissions or repayments
to which it may be entitled.

            SECTION 2.12. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Lender shall obtain
at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of
any right of set off, or otherwise, other than as a result of an assignment
pursuant to Section 9.07) (a) on account of Obligations due and payable to such
Lender hereunder and under the Notes at such time in excess of its ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and
payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Obligations due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the Notes at such
time) of payments on account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lenders
hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such
time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such
Lender hereunder and under the Notes at such time in excess of its ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations owing to such
Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations owing (but
not due and payable) to all Lenders hereunder and under the Notes at such time)
of payments on account of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all
Lenders hereunder and under the Notes at such time obtained by all of the
Lenders at such time, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other
Lenders such interests or participating interests in the Obligations due and
payable or owing to them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause
such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each other
Lender shall be rescinded and such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing
Lender the purchase price to the extent of such Lender's ratable share
(according to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to such Lender to
(ii) the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lenders) of such recovery together
with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion
of (i) the amount of such other Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total
amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount
paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so
recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing an interest or
participating interest from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12 may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of set-off) with respect to such interest or participating
interest, as the case

                                       35
<PAGE>

may be, as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in
the amount of such interest or participating interest, as the case may be.

            SECTION 2.13. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Term Advances
shall be available (and the Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds)
solely (a) to refinance certain Existing Debt and Surviving Debt secured by
mortgage Liens encumbering the Mortgage Assets plus the amount of any applicable
premiums and expenses, and (b) to pay fees, costs and expenses related to the
Term Facility, the TRS Recapitalization Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 2.14. Evidence of Debt. (a) Each Lender shall maintain in
accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the
indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Term Advance
owing to such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. Each
Borrower agrees that upon notice by any Lender to the Borrowers (with a copy of
such notice to the Administrative Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or
other evidence of indebtedness is required or appropriate in order for such
Lender to evidence (whether for purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise)
the Term Advances owing to, or to be made by, such Lender, the Borrowers shall
promptly execute and deliver to such Lender, with a copy to the Administrative
Agent, a Note, in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto, payable to the
order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the Term Commitment of such
Lender. All references to Notes in the Loan Documents shall mean Notes, if any,
to the extent issued hereunder.

            (b) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 9.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for
each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date
and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Term Advances
comprising such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it, (iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder, and (iv)
the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrowers
hereunder and each Lender's share thereof.

            (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the
Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or
accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the
amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrowers to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case
of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest
error; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the
Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.

            SECTION 2.15. Extension of Maturity Date. At least 30 days but not
more than 60 days prior to the Maturity Date, the Borrowers, by written notice
to the Administrative Agent, may request, with respect to the Term Advances then
outstanding, a single one-year extension of the Maturity Date. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request and the
Maturity Date in effect at such time shall, effective as at the Maturity Date
(the "EXTENSION DATE"), be extended for an additional one year period, provided
that on the Maturity Date the following statements shall be true and the
Administrative Agent shall have received for

                                       36
<PAGE>

the account of each Lender a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Borrowers, dated the Extension Date, stating that: (i) the representations and
warranties contained in Section 4.01 are true and correct on and as of the
Extension Date, and (ii) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing or would result for such extension. In the event that extension is
effected pursuant to this Section 2.15 (but subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.04, 2.05 and 6.01), (x) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
all Term Advances shall be repaid in full ratably to the Lenders on the Maturity
Date as so extended, and (y) a corresponding adjustment shall be made to the
table of scheduled principal amortization payments set forth in Section 2.03 to
reflect such extension, as determined by the Administrative Agent. As of the
Extension Date, any and all references to this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or
any other Loan Documents to the "Maturity Date" shall refer to the Maturity Date
as so extended.

      4.01(f) hereto.

            (g) All governmental and third party consents and approvals
      necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan
      Documents shall have been obtained (without the imposition of any
      conditions that are not acceptable to the Lenders)

                                       39
<PAGE>

      and shall remain in effect, and no law or regulation shall be applicable
      in the reasonable judgment of the Lenders that restrains, prevents or
      imposes materially adverse conditions upon the transactions contemplated
      by the Loan Documents.

            (h) The Borrower shall have paid all accrued fees of the Agents and
      the Lenders and all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses of the Agents
      (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
      Administrative Agent).

            SECTION 3.02. Conditions Precedent to Each Borrowing. The obligation
of each Lender to make a Term Advance on the occasion of each Borrowing
(including the initial Borrowing) and the extension of the Maturity Date
pursuant to Section 2.15 shall be subject to the further conditions precedent
that on the date of such Borrowing or extension (a) the following statements
shall be true and the Administrative Agent shall have received (i) in the case
of any Borrowing by an Additional Borrower, (A) an Accession Agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto or otherwise in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (B) for the benefit of each
Lender, a Note executed and delivered by such Additional Borrower to the order

such Lender's Term Commitment, dated the date of the related Accession Agreement
and otherwise substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (in each case to the
extent not previously delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(j)(i) or this Section
3.02), and (ii) for the account of such Lender a certificate signed by a
Responsible Officer of the Borrowers, dated the date of such Borrowing or
extension, stating that:

            (A) the representations and warranties contained in each Loan
      Document are true and correct on and as of such date, before and after
      giving effect to (1) such Borrowing or extension, and (2) in the case of
      any Borrowing, the application of the proceeds therefrom, as though made
      on and as of such date;

            (B) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,

      Term Advance, the Borrowers shall be in compliance with the covenants
      contained in Section 5.04, together with supporting information in form
      satisfactory to the Administrative Agent showing the computations used in
      determining compliance with such covenants;

and (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received such other approvals,
opinions or documents as any Lender through the Administrative Agent may
reasonably request.

determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 3.01, each
Lender shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be
satisfied with each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented
to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lenders unless an officer
of the Administrative Agent responsible for the transactions contemplated by the
Loan Documents shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the Closing
Date specifying its objection thereto and such Lender shall not have made
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing.

      comply, and cause each of its Subsidiaries and all lessees and other
      Persons operating or occupying its properties to comply, in all material

      case of Subsidiaries of the Borrower Parties (other than TRS Guarantor,

      or be violated as a result of any transaction by or involving any Borrower
      Party or Subsidiary thereof otherwise permitted under Section 5.02(d) or

      (other than transactions exclusively among or between TRS Guarantor and/or
      one or more of the Borrowers) on terms that are fair and reasonable and no

      Guarantor or any Borrower) may liquidate or dissolve if the Borrowers
      determine in good faith that such liquidation or dissolution is in the
      best interests of the Borrowers and the assets or proceeds from the
      liquidation or dissolution of such Subsidiary are transferred to a

      such Assets so long as Section 5.02(e) would otherwise permit the Transfer
      of all Assets owned by such Subsidiary at the time of such sale or
      transfer of such Equity Interests. Upon the sale or transfer of Equity
      Interests in a Person permitted under clause

                                       54

      (ii) above, provided that (x) no Default or Event of Default shall have
      occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, (y) any prepayment
      of Term Advances required pursuant to Section 2.05(b) shall have been
      made, and (z) if such Person is the sole Borrower hereunder, all
      Obligations of the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents have been paid in
      full in cash, all Secured Hedge Agreements shall have expired or been
      terminated and all Term Commitments shall have expired or been terminated,

      otherwise dispose of, or grant any option or other right to purchase,
      lease (other than any option or right to enter into Tenancy Leases) or
      otherwise acquire (each such action, including without limitation and Sale
      and Leaseback Transaction, being a "TRANSFER"), any Hotel Asset (or any
      direct or indirect Equity Interests in the owner thereof) other than the
      following Transfers, which shall be permitted hereunder only so long as no
      Default or Event of Default shall exist on the date of such Transfer or
      would result therefrom: (i) the Transfer of any Mortgage Asset to a
      Borrower on or prior to the Collateral Delivery Date pursuant to the TRS
      Recapitalization Transactions, (ii) the Transfer of any Hotel Asset from
      any Borrower Party to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of such Borrower Party
      that is itself a Borrower Party (or that becomes a Borrower Party on the
      date of such Transfer), and (iii) the Transfer of any Hotel Asset at any
      time to any Person, provided that any Transfer described in this clause
      (iii) satisfies the following requirements: (A) the purchase price paid to
      the applicable Borrower Party for such Hotel Asset shall not be less than
      the fair market value of such Hotel Asset at the time of such sale, (B)
      the entire purchase price paid for such Hotel Asset shall be paid to the
      applicable Borrower Party solely in cash, and (C) all gross sales proceeds
      from such Transfer, net of actual expenses incurred in connection
      therewith (the "NET SALES PROCEEDS"), shall be applied to prepay the Term
      Advances to the extent required pursuant to Section 2.05(b).

            (f) Investments. No Borrower Party shall make or hold, or permit any
      of its Subsidiaries to make or hold, any Investment other than:

                  (vii) Investments received in satisfaction or partial
            satisfaction thereof from financially troubled account debtors to

      Guarantor or its Subsidiaries to make the Permitted Distribution to FLLP.

            (h) Amendments of Constitutive Documents. No Loan Party shall amend,
      in each case in any material respect, its limited liability company
      agreement, partnership agreement, certificate of incorporation or bylaws
      or other constitutive documents, provided that any amendment to any such
      constitutive document that would be adverse to any of the Secured Parties
      shall be deemed "material" for purposes of this Section; provided further
      that any amendment to any such constitutive document that would designate
      such Subsidiary as a "special purpose entity" or otherwise confirm such

      material" for purposes of this Section; and provided still further that
      this Section 5.02(h) shall not apply to FLLP (but it shall continue to
      apply to the other Loan Parties) after the FLLP Cap Date.

      impair or otherwise adversely affect in any material respect the interest
      or rights, if any, of any Agent or any Lender, or permit any of its
      Subsidiaries to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that this
      Section 5.02(l) shall not apply to FLLP (but it shall continue to apply to
      the other Loan Parties) after the FLLP Cap Date.

      Party could reasonably be expected to incur material liability or for
      which a Lien may be imposed on any asset of such Borrower Party, provided
      that notice is required only for any of the events described in clauses
      (i) through (iv) above that could reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect, could reasonably be expected to result in a
      material Environmental Action with respect to any Hotel Asset or could
      reasonably be expected to result in a Lien against any Hotel Asset.

            (h) Hotel Asset Value. Promptly after discovery of any setoff,
      claim, withholding or defense asserted or effected against any Loan Party,
      or to which any Hotel Asset is subject, which could reasonably be expected
      to (i) have a material adverse effect on the value of a Hotel Asset, (ii)
      have a Material Adverse Effect or (iii) result in the imposition or
      assertion of a Lien against any Hotel Asset which is not a Permitted Lien,
      provide the Administrative Agent with notice thereof.

            (i) Compliance with Qualifying Asset Conditions. Promptly after
      obtaining actual knowledge of any condition or event which causes any
      Hotel Asset to fail to satisfy any of the Qualifying Asset Conditions at a
      time when satisfaction of such conditions by such Hotel Asset is required
      pursuant to Section 5.01(p) (other than those Qualifying Asset Conditions,
      if any, that have theretofore been waived by the Required Lenders with
      respect to a particular Hotel Asset, to the extent of such waiver),
      provide the Administrative Agent with notice thereof.

            (j) Other Information. Promptly, such other information respecting
      the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
      properties or prospects of any Borrower Party or any Subsidiary thereof as
      the Administrative Agent, or any Lender through the Administrative Agent,
      may from time to time reasonably request.

      SECTION 5.04. Financial Covenants. So long as any Term Advance or any
other Obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall remain unpaid
or any Lender shall have any Term Commitment hereunder, the Borrowers will
maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter of the Borrowers a Mortgage Assets
Debt Service Coverage Ratio of not less than 1.25:1.00.

      any Loan Document, in each case under this clause (ii) within three
      Business Days after the same becomes due and payable; or

            (b) Breach of Representations and Warranties. Any representation or
      warranty made by any Loan Party (or any of its officers or the officers of
      its general partner or managing member, as applicable) under or in
      connection with any Loan Document shall prove to have been incorrect in
      any material respect when made; or

            (c) Breach of Certain Covenants. Any Loan Party (i) shall fail to
      perform or observe any term, covenant or agreement contained in Section
      2.13, 5.01(d), (e), (f), (i), (j), (n), (o) or (q), 5.02, 5.03(a), (e),

      unremedied for five Business Days after the earlier of the date on which
      (A) a Responsible Officer becomes aware of such failure or (B) written
      notice thereof shall have been given to the Borrowers by any Agent or any
      Lender; or

            (d) Other Defaults under Loan Documents. Any Loan Party shall fail
      to perform or observe any other term, covenant or agreement contained in
      any Loan Document on its part to be performed or observed if such failure
      shall remain unremedied for 30 days after the earlier of the date on which
      (i) a Responsible Officer becomes aware of such failure or (ii) written
      notice thereof shall have been given to the Borrowers by any Agent or any
      Lender; or

            (e) Cross Defaults. (i) Any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a
      Borrower Party shall fail to pay any principal of, premium or interest on
      or any other amount payable in respect of any Material Debt when the same
      becomes due and payable (whether by scheduled maturity, required
      prepayment, acceleration, demand or otherwise); or (ii) any other event
      shall occur or condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument
      relating to any such Material Debt, if (A) the effect of such event or
      condition is to permit the acceleration of the maturity of such Material
      Debt or otherwise permit the holders thereof to cause such Material Debt
      to mature, and (B) such event or condition shall remain unremedied or
      otherwise uncured for a period of 30 days; or (iii) the maturity of any
      such Material Debt shall be accelerated or any such Material Debt shall be

      purchased or defeased, or an offer to prepay, redeem, purchase or defease
      such Material Debt shall be required to be made, in each case prior to the
      stated maturity thereof; or

            (f) Insolvency Events. Any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a
      Borrower Party shall generally not pay its debts as such debts become due,
      or shall admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally, or
      shall make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or any
      proceeding shall be instituted by or against any Loan Party or any
      Subsidiary of a Borrower Party seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or
      insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization,
      arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief, or composition of it or its
      debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
      or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or the
      appointment of a receiver, trustee, or other similar official for it or
      for any substantial part

                                       61
<PAGE>

      of its property and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted against
      it (but not instituted by it) that is being diligently contested by it in
      good faith, either such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed
      for a period of 60 days or any of the actions sought in such proceeding
      (including, without limitation, the entry of an order for relief against,
      or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar
      official for, it or any substantial part of its property) shall occur; or
      any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Borrower Party shall take any
      corporate action to authorize any of the actions set forth above in this
      subsection (f); or

            (g) Monetary Judgments. Any judgments or orders, either individually
      or in the aggregate, for the payment of money in excess of $5,000,000
      shall be rendered against any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Borrower
      Party and either (i) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by
      any creditor upon such judgment or order or (ii) there shall be any period
      of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment
      or order, by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in
      effect; provided, however, that any such judgment or order shall not give
      rise to an Event of Default under this Section 6.01(g) if and so long as
      (A) the amount of such judgment or order which remains unsatisfied is
      covered by a valid and binding policy of insurance between the respective
      Loan Party or Subsidiary and the insurer covering full payment of such
      unsatisfied amount and (B) such insurer, which shall be rated at least "A"
      by A.M. Best Company, has been notified, and has not disputed the claim
      made for payment, of the amount of such judgment or order; or

            (h) Non-Monetary Judgments. Any non-monetary judgment or order shall
      be rendered against any Loan Party or any Subsidiary of a Borrower Party
      that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
      there shall be any period of 30 consecutive days during which a stay of
      enforcement of such judgment or order, by reason of a pending appeal or
      otherwise, shall not be in effect; or

      Document after delivery thereof pursuant to Section 3.01 or 5.01(j) shall
      for any reason (other than pursuant to the terms thereof) cease to be
      valid and binding on or enforceable against any Loan Party party to it, or
      any such Loan Party shall so state in writing; or

            (j) Security Failure. Any Collateral Document or financing statement
      after delivery thereof pursuant to Section 5.01(j) shall for any reason
      (other than pursuant to the terms thereof) cease to create a valid and
      perfected first priority lien on and security interest in the Collateral
      purported to be covered thereby; or

            (k) Change of Control. A Change of Control shall occur; or

            (l) ERISA Events. Any ERISA Event shall have occurred with respect
      to a Plan and the sum (determined as of the date of occurrence of such
      ERISA Event) of the Insufficiency of such Plan and the Insufficiency of
      any and all other Plans with respect to which an ERISA Event shall have
      occurred and then exist (or the liability of the Loan Parties and the
      ERISA Affiliates related to such ERISA Event) exceeds $5,000,000;

then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the request,
or may with the consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrowers,
declare the Term Commitments of each Lender and the obligation of each Lender to
make Term Advances to be terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith
terminate, and (ii) shall at the request, or may with the

                                       62
<PAGE>

consent, of the Required Lenders, by notice to the Borrowers, declare the Notes,
all interest thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Notes, all
such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any kind, all
of which are hereby expressly waived by each Borrower; provided, however, that
in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to
the Borrower under any Bankruptcy Law, (y) the Term Commitment of each Lender
and the obligation of each Lender to make Term Advances shall automatically be
terminated and (z) the Notes, all such interest and all such amounts shall
automatically become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
each Borrower.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                                    GUARANTY

            SECTION 7.01. Guaranty; Limitation of Liability. (a) Each Guarantor
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual
payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required
prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of each
other Loan Party now or hereafter existing under or in respect of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications,
substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing
Obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether
for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action,
costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent
or any other Secured Party in enforcing any rights under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the
Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any other Loan Party to any Secured
Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are
unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Loan Party. This
Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not merely of collection.

            (b) Each Guarantor, the Administrative Agent and each Lender and, by
its acceptance of the benefits of this Guaranty, each other Secured Party,
hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty
and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance for purposes of Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign,
federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention,
the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and, by their acceptance
of the benefits of this Guaranty, the other Secured Parties hereby irrevocably
agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time
shall be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such
Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance.

            (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to any Secured Party
under this Guaranty or any other guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to
the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Guarantor and
each other guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid to the Secured
Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents.

                                       63
<PAGE>

            SECTION 7.02. Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation
or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such
terms or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party with
respect thereto. The Obligations of each Guarantor under or in respect of this
Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations
of any other Loan Party under or in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted
against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any
action is brought against the Borrowers (or any of them) or any other Loan Party
or whether the Borrowers (or any of them) or any other Loan Party is joined in
any such action or actions. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty
shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter
acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

            (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or
      any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

            (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
      other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
      Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect of the Loan
      Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
      from any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the
      Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit
      to the Borrowers (or any of them), any other Loan Party or any of their
      Subsidiaries or otherwise;

            (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any
      collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent
      to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the Guaranteed
      Obligations;

            (d) any manner of application of collateral, or proceeds thereof, to
      all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or other
      disposition of any collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations
      or any other Obligations of any Loan Party under the Loan Documents or any
      other assets of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

            (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
      structure or existence of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

            (f) any failure of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured
      Party to disclose to any Loan Party any information relating to the
      business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
      properties or prospects of any other Loan Party now or hereafter known to
      the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party (each Guarantor
      waiving any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent and each other
      Secured Party to disclose such information);

            (g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this
      Agreement, any other Loan Document, any Guaranty Supplement, any Accession
      Agreement or any other guaranty or agreement or the release or reduction
      of liability of any Guarantor or other guarantor or surety with respect to
      the Guaranteed Obligations; or

                                       64
<PAGE>

            (h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
      statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any
      representation by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party that
      might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any
      Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by any Secured Party or any other Person upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrowers (or any of them) or
any other Loan Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

            SECTION 7.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments. (a) Each Guarantor hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance,
default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or
insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any
action against any Loan Party or any other Person or any collateral.

            (b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
right (including without limitation any such right arising under California
Civil Code Section 2815) to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this
Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations,
whether existing now or in the future.

            (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i)
any and all rights and defenses available to it by reason of Sections 2787 to
2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Civil Code, including without
limitation any and all rights or defenses such Guarantor may have by reason of
protection afforded to the principal with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or to any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations with
respect to any of such guarantor's obligations under its guaranty, in either
case pursuant to the antideficiency or other laws of the State of California
limiting or discharging the principal's indebtedness or such guarantor's
obligations, including without limitation Section 580a, 580b, 580d or 726 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure, (ii) any defense arising by reason of any
claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Administrative Agent
or any other Secured Party that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or
otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification rights of such Guarantor or other rights of such
Guarantor to proceed against any of the other Loan Parties, any other guarantor
or any other Person or any collateral and (iii) any defense based on any right
of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder. No other provision of the Guaranty shall be construed as
limiting the generality of any of the covenants and waivers set forth in this
paragraph. As provided below, this Guaranty shall be governed by, and shall be
construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
This paragraph is included solely out of an abundance of caution, and shall not
be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced provisions of California
law are in any way applicable to this Guaranty or to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations.

            (d) Each Guarantor waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or
indirect, that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against any Loan
Party or any of its assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance
by such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim,
right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute (including without
limitation under California Civil Code Section 2847, 2848 or 2849), under

                                       65
<PAGE>

common law or otherwise and including without limitation (a) any right of
subrogation, reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may
hereafter have against any such Loan Party, (b) any right to enforce, or to
participate in, any claim, right or remedy that any Secured Party now has or may
hereafter have against any Loan Party, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to
participate in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by any Secured
Party.

            (e) Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Administrative Agent may,
without notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without affecting the
liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, foreclose under any mortgage by
nonjudicial sale, and each Guarantor hereby waives any defense to the recovery
by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against such Guarantor
of any deficiency after such nonjudicial sale and any defense or benefits that
may be afforded by applicable law (including, without limitation, Sections 580a
and 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any other law of any other
jurisdiction having similar effect).

            (f) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to
disclose to such Guarantor any matter, fact or thing relating to the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or
prospects of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their Subsidiaries now
or hereafter known by the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party.

            (g) Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth in
Section 7.02 and this Section 7.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

            SECTION 7.04. Subrogation. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter
acquire against the Borrowers (or any of them), any other Loan Party or any
other insider guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or
enforcement of such Guarantor's Obligations under or in respect of this
Guaranty, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution
or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any
Secured Party against the Borrowers (or any of them), any other Loan Party or
any other insider guarantor or any collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy
or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including,
without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrowers (or any of
them), any other Loan Party or any other insider guarantor, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until
all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this
Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, all Secured Hedge Agreements
shall have expired or been terminated and the Term Commitments shall have
expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in
violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the latest
of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) the latest date of expiration or
termination of all Secured Hedge Agreements, and (c) the Maturity Date, such
amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and
shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be
credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms
of the Loan Documents. If (i) any Guarantor shall make payment to any Secured
Party of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the

                                       66
<PAGE>

Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall
have been paid in full in cash, (iii) all Secured Hedge Agreements shall have
expired or been terminated, and (iv) the Maturity Date shall have occurred, the
Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties will, at such Guarantor's
request and expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate
documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to
evidence the transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the
Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor
pursuant to this Guaranty.

            SECTION 7.05. Guaranty Supplements and Accession Agreements. Upon
the execution and delivery by any Person of a Guaranty Supplement or an
Accession Agreement, (a) such Person shall be referred to as an "ADDITIONAL
GUARANTOR" and shall become and be a Guarantor hereunder, and each reference in
this Agreement to a "Guarantor" or a "Loan Party" shall also mean and be a
reference to such Additional Guarantor, and each reference in any other Loan
Document to a "Guarantor" shall also mean and be a reference to such Additional
Guarantor, and (b) each reference herein to "this Agreement", "this Guaranty",
"hereunder", "hereof" or words of like import referring to this Agreement and
this Guaranty, and each reference in any other Loan Document to the "Loan
Agreement", "Guaranty", "thereunder", "thereof" or words of like import
referring to this Agreement and this Guaranty, shall mean and be a reference to
this Agreement and this Guaranty as supplemented by such Guaranty Supplement or
Accession Agreement.

            SECTION 7.06. Indemnification by Guarantors. (a) Without limitation
on any other Obligations of any Guarantor or remedies of the Administrative
Agent or the Secured Parties under this Agreement, this Guaranty or the other
Loan Documents, each Guarantor shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, each
other Secured Party and each of their Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from
and against, and shall pay on demand, any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Indemnified Party in connection with or as a result of any failure of any
Guaranteed Obligations to be the legal, valid and binding obligations of any
Loan Party enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with their terms.

            (b) Each Guarantor hereby also agrees that no Indemnified Party
shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or
otherwise) to any of the Guarantors or any of their respective Affiliates or any
of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors, and
each Guarantor hereby agrees not to assert any claim against any Indemnified
Party on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to the Term Facility, the
actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Term Advances, the Loan Documents
or any of the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 7.07. Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates any
and all debts, liabilities and other Obligations owed to such Guarantor by each
other Loan Party (the "SUBORDINATED OBLIGATIONS") to the Guaranteed Obligations
to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Section 7.07.

            (a) Prohibited Payments, Etc. Except during the continuance of a
      Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding
      under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), each Guarantor
      may receive regularly scheduled payments or payments made in the ordinary
      course of business from any other Loan Party on account of the
      Subordinated Obligations. After the occurrence and during the

                                       67
<PAGE>

      continuance of any Default (including the commencement and continuation of
      any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party),
      however, unless the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees, no Guarantor
      shall demand, accept or take any action to collect any payment on account
      of the Subordinated Obligations.

            (b) Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any proceeding under
      any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party, each Guarantor agrees
      that the Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive payment in full in
      cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (including all interest and expenses
      accruing after the commencement of a proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law,
      whether or not constituting an allowed claim in such proceeding ("POST
      PETITION INTEREST")) before such Guarantor receives payment of any
      Subordinated Obligations.

            (c) Turn-Over. After the occurrence and during the continuance of
      any Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding
      under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any other Loan Party), each Guarantor
      shall, if the Administrative Agent so requests, collect, enforce and
      receive payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee for
      the Secured Parties and deliver such payments to the Administrative Agent
      on account of the Guaranteed Obligations (including all Post Petition
      Interest), together with any necessary endorsements or other instruments
      of transfer, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability
      of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.

            (d) Administrative Agent Authorization. After the occurrence and
      during the continuance of any Default (including the commencement and
      continuation of any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law relating to any
      other Loan Party), the Administrative Agent is authorized and empowered
      (but without any obligation to so do), in its discretion, (i) in the name
      of each Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect
      of, Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to
      the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post Petition Interest),
      and (ii) to require each Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to
      submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any
      amounts received on such obligations to the Administrative Agent for
      application to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post
      Petition Interest).

            SECTION 7.08. Continuing Guaranty. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the latest of (i)
the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guaranty, (ii) the Maturity Date and (iii) the latest date of
expiration or termination of all Secured Hedge Agreements, (b) be binding upon
the Guarantors, their successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and
their successors, transferees and assigns.

            SECTION 7.09. Recourse Nature of Guaranty; FLLP Cap Date. The
Guaranteed Obligations shall be full recourse obligations of FLLP; provided,
however, that notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, from and
after the FLLP Cap Date, the aggregate liability of FLLP in respect of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall be limited to an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of Losses comprising Recourse Carve-Out Liabilities (the "FLLP CAP"). The
FLLP Cap shall be reduced only by the final payments in such amount made by the
Borrowers in respect of their Obligations under the Loan Documents. The
Guaranteed Obligations shall at all times be full recourse obligations of each
Guarantor other than FLLP.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   THE AGENTS

            SECTION 8.01. Authorization and Action; Appointment of Supplemental
Collateral Agents. (a) Each Lender (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as
potential Hedge Banks) hereby appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to such Agent by
the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto. As to any matters not expressly provided for by
the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of
the Notes), no Agent shall be required to exercise any discretion or take any
action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be
fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of
the Required Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders
and all holders of Notes; provided, however, that no Agent shall be required to
take any action that exposes such Agent to personal liability or that is
contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. Each Agent agrees to give to each
Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Borrowers pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan
Document, no Person identified as a syndication agent, documentation agent,
senior manager, sole lead arranger or sole book running manager, in such
Person's capacity as such, shall have any obligations or duties to any Loan
Party, the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party under any of such
Loan Documents.

            (b) Anything contained herein or in the Collateral Documents to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Collateral Agent may from time to time, when the
Collateral Agent deems it to be necessary, appoint one or more trustees,
co-trustees, collateral co-agents or collateral subagents (each, a "SUPPLEMENTAL
COLLATERAL AGENT") with respect to all or any part of the Collateral. In the
event that the Collateral Agent so appoints any Supplemental Collateral Agent
with respect to any Collateral, (i) such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall
automatically be vested, in addition to the Collateral Agent, with all rights,
powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Collateral Agent under the
Collateral Documents with respect to such Collateral; (ii) such Supplemental
Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be an "Agent" for purposes of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, and the provisions of this Article and Section
9.04 hereof that refer to the Agents (or either of them) shall inure to the
benefit of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, and all references therein and in
the other Loan Documents to the Collateral Agent shall be deemed to be
references to the Collateral Agent and/or such Supplemental Collateral Agent, as
the context may require; and (iii) the term "Collateral Agent", when used herein
or in any applicable Collateral Document in relation to the Liens on or security
interests in such Collateral granted in favor of the Collateral Agent, and any
rights, powers, privileges, interests and remedies of the Collateral Agent with
respect to such Collateral, shall be deemed to include such Supplemental
Collateral Agent; provided, however, that no such Supplemental Collateral Agent
shall be authorized to take any action with respect to any such Collateral
unless and except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by the
Collateral Agent. Should any instrument in writing from any Borrower or any
other Loan Party be required by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed
by the Collateral Agent to more fully or certainly vest in and confirming to
such Supplemental Collateral Agent such rights, powers, privileges and duties,
the applicable Borrower shall, or shall cause such Loan Party to, execute,
acknowledge and deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by
the Collateral Agent. If any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or successor
thereto, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to
the extent permitted by law, shall automatically vest in and be exercised by the
Collateral Agent until the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

                                       69
<PAGE>

            SECTION 8.02. Agents' Reliance, Etc. Neither any Agent nor any of
its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, except for its or their own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each Agent: (a) in the
case of the Administrative Agent, may treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment and
Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as
assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, or, in the case of any other
Agent, such Agent has received notice from the Administrative Agent that it has
received and accepted such Assignment and Acceptance, as provided in Section
9.07; (b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Loan Party),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no
warranty or representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any
Lender for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or
oral) made in or in connection with the Loan Documents; (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance, observance or
satisfaction of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of any Loan Document
on the part of any Loan Party or the existence at any time of any Default under
the Loan Documents or to inspect the property (including the books and records)
of any Loan Party; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due
execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value
of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or
purported to be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram,
telecopy or telex or other electronic communication) believed by it to be
genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

            SECTION 8.03. CNAI and Affiliates. With respect to its Term
Commitment, the Term Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, CNAI shall
have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent; and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated, include CNAI in its
individual capacity. CNAI and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to, act as trustee under indentures of, accept investment banking
engagements from and generally engage in any kind of business with, any Loan
Party, any Subsidiary of any Loan Party and any Person that may do business with
or own securities of any Loan Party or any such Subsidiary, all as if CNAI were
not the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.

            SECTION 8.04. Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender
and based on the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

            SECTION 8.05. Indemnification by Lenders. (a) Each Lender severally
agrees to indemnify each Agent (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the
Borrowers) from and against such Lender's ratable share (determined as provided
below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or

                                       70
<PAGE>

disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the
Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by such Agent under the Loan
Documents (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED COSTS"); provided, however, that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
resulting from any Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct as found in a
final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse each Agent promptly
upon demand for its ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrowers under Section
9.04, to the extent that such Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs
and expenses by the Borrowers. In the case of any investigation, litigation or
proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Costs, this Section 8.05 applies
whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any
Lender or any other Person.

            (b) For purposes of this Section 8.05, the Lenders' respective
ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time, according to
their respective Term Commitments at such time. The failure of any Lender to
reimburse any Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount
required to be paid by the Lenders to such Agent as provided herein shall not
relieve any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent for
its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to reimburse such Agent for such other Lender's
ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of any Lender hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender
contained in this Section 8.05 shall survive the payment in full of principal,
interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.

            SECTION 8.06. Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign at any time by
giving 30 days' prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower and
may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Required Lenders;
provided, however, that any removal of the Administrative Agent will not be
effective until it has been replaced as Collateral Agent and released from all
obligations in respect thereof. Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent (which
successor Agent shall, provided no Event of Default shall then have occurred and
by continuing, be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers). If no successor Agent
shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted
such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Required Lenders' removal of the retiring Agent, then the
retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent (which
successor Agent shall, provided no Event of Default shall then have occurred and
by continuing, be reasonably acceptable to the Borrowers), which shall be a
commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or of any State
thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon
the acceptance of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
and, in the case of a successor Collateral Agent, upon the execution and filing
or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such
amendments or supplements to the Mortgages and Assignments of Leases, and such
other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the
Required Lenders may request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens
granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor
Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
discretion, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. If
within 45 days after written notice is given of the retiring Agent's resignation
or removal under this Section 8.06 no successor Agent shall have been appointed
and shall have accepted such appointment, then on such 45th day (i) the retiring
Agent's resignation or removal shall become effective, (ii) the retiring Agent
shall

                                       71
<PAGE>

thereupon be discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents
and (iii) the Required Lenders shall thereafter perform all duties of the
retiring Agent under the Loan Documents until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided above. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as an Agent shall have become effective, the
provisions of this Article VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            SECTION 9.01. Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor consent
to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the applicable Loan Party and
signed or consented to by the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders, and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all of the Lenders, do
any of the following at any time: (i) change the number of Lenders or the
percentage of (x) the Term Commitments or (y) the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of the Term Advances that, in each case, shall be required for the
Lenders or any of them to take any action hereunder, (ii) release the Borrowers
(or any of them) with respect to the Obligations (except to the extent permitted
pursuant to the last sentence of Section 5.02(d)) or, except to the extent
expressly permitted under this Agreement, reduce or limit the obligations of any
Guarantor under Article VII or release such Guarantor or otherwise limit such
Guarantor's liability with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, (iii) release
all or substantially all of the Collateral (other than pursuant to Section
5.02(e) or 9.11), (iv) amend this Section 9.01, (v) increase the Term
Commitments of the Lenders or subject the Lenders to any additional obligations,
(vi) reduce the principal of, or interest on, the Obligations of the Loan
Parties under the Loan Documents or any fees or other amounts payable
thereunder, (vii) postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or (viii)
extend the Maturity Date (other than as provided by Section 2.15); provided
further that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed
by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in addition to the Lenders
required above to take such action, affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 9.02. Notices, Etc. (a) All notices and other communications
provided for hereunder shall be either (x) in writing (including telecopier or
telegraphic communication) and mailed, telecopied, telegraphed or delivered, (y)
as and to the extent set forth in Section 9.02(b) and in the proviso to this
Section 9.02(a), in an electronic medium and delivered as set forth in Section
9.02(b) or (z) as and to the extent expressly permitted in this Agreement,
transmitted by e-mail, provided that such e-mail shall in all cases include an
attachment (in PDF format or similar format) containing a legible signature of
the person providing such notice, if to any Loan Party, at c/o FelCor Lodging
Trust Incorporated, 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 1300, Irving, Texas
75062-3933, Attention: Andrew J. Welch or, if applicable, at awelch@felcor.com

attention of Andrew J. Welch and Joel Eastman at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway,
Suite 1300, Irving, Texas 75062-3933); if to the Initial Lender, at its Domestic
Lending Office or, if applicable, at the e-mail address specified opposite its
name on Schedule I hereto (and in the case of a transmission by e-mail, with a
copy by U.S. mail to its Domestic Lending Office); if to any other Lender, at
its Domestic Lending Office or, if applicable, at the e-mail address specified
in the Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender (and

                                       72
<PAGE>

in the case of a transmission by e-mail, with a copy by U.S. mail to its
Domestic Lending Office); and if to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral
Agent, at its address at Two Penns Way, Suite 100, New Castle, Delaware 19720,
Attention: Annemarie E. Pavco, Global Loans, or, if applicable, at
annemarie.e.pavco@citigroup.com (and in the case of a transmission by e-mail,
with a copy by U.S. mail to Two Penns Way, Suite 110, New Castle, Delaware
19720, Attention: Annemarie E. Pavco, Global Loans) or, as to any Loan Party or
any Agent, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a
written notice to the other parties and, as to each other party, at such other
address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the
Borrowers and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and communications
shall, when mailed, telecopied, telegraphed or e-mailed, be effective when
deposited in the mails, telecopied, delivered to the telegraph company or
confirmed by e-mail, respectively, except that notices and communications to any
Agent pursuant to Article II, III or VIII or to the Collateral Agent under the
Collateral Documents shall not be effective until received by such Agent or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may be. Delivery by telecopier of an executed
counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
Notes or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered hereunder shall be
effective as delivery of an original executed counterpart thereof.

            (b) So long as CNAI is the Administrative Agent, materials required
to be delivered pursuant to Sections 5.03(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (i) shall
be delivered to the Administrative Agent in an electronic medium in a format
acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by e-mail at
oploanswebadmin@citigroup.com. Each Borrower agrees that the Administrative
Agent may make such materials, as well as any other written information,
documents, instruments and other material relating to any Borrower, any Loan
Party, any of their Subsidiaries or any other materials or matters relating to
this Agreement, the Notes or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "COMMUNICATIONS") available to the Lenders by posting such
notices on Intralinks or a substantially similar electronic transmission system
(the "PLATFORM"). Each Borrower acknowledges that (i) the distribution of
material through an electronic medium is not necessarily secure and that there
are confidentiality and other risks associated with such distribution, (ii) the
Platform is provided "as is" and "as available" and (iii) neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its Affiliates warrants the accuracy, adequacy
or completeness of the Communications or the Platform and each expressly
disclaims liability for errors or omissions in the Communications or the
Platform. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including,
without limitation, any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other
code defects, is made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with the Platform.

            (c) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next
sentence) (a "NOTICE") specifying that any Communications have been posted to
the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of such information, documents
or other materials to such Lender for purposes of this Agreement, provided that
if requested by any Lender, the Administrative Agent shall deliver a copy of the
Communications to such Lender by e-mail or telecopier. Each Lender agrees (i) to
notify the Administrative Agent in writing of such Lender's e-mail address to
which a Notice may be sent by electronic transmission (including by electronic
communication) on or before the date such Lender becomes a party to this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter to ensure that the Administrative
Agent has on record an effective e-mail address for such Lender) and (ii) that
any Notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

            SECTION 9.03. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
Lender or any Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
or under any Note shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any

                                       73
<PAGE>

other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

            SECTION 9.04. Costs and Expenses. (a) Each Loan Party agrees jointly
and severally to pay on demand (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses of each Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification and amendment of the Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, (A) all due diligence, collateral review, syndication,
transportation, computer, duplication, appraisal, audit, insurance, consultant,
search, filing and recording fees and expenses, (B) the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel for such Agent with respect thereto (including, without
limitation, with respect to reviewing and advising on any matters required to be
completed by the Loan Parties on a post-closing basis), with respect to advising
such Agent as to its rights and responsibilities, or the perfection, protection
or preservation of rights or interests, under the Loan Documents, with respect
to negotiations with any Loan Party or with other creditors of any Loan Party or
any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any Default or any events or
circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with respect to presenting
claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights generally and any
proceeding ancillary thereto and (C) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
for such Agent with respect to the preparation, execution, delivery and review
of any documents and instruments at any time delivered pursuant to Section
5.01(j)) and (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of each Agent
and each Lender in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of the Loan Documents, whether in
any action, suit or litigation, or any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceeding affecting creditors' rights generally (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for such Agent and each Lender with
respect thereto).

            (b) Each Loan Party agrees to indemnify, defend and save and hold
harmless each Indemnified Party from and against, and shall pay on demand, any
and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be incurred by or
asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case arising out of
or in connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in
connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a
defense in connection therewith) (i) the Term Facility, the actual or proposed
use of the proceeds of the Term Advances, the Loan Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated thereby or (ii) the actual or alleged presence of
Hazardous Materials on any property of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or any Environmental Action relating in any way to any Loan Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, except to the extent such claim, damage, loss, liability or
expense is found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In the case of an investigation, litigation or other
proceeding to which the indemnity in this Section 9.04(b) applies, such
indemnity shall be effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or
proceeding is brought by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnified Party, whether or not any Indemnified Party is
otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents are consummated. Each Loan Party also agrees not to assert
any claim against any Agent, any Lender or any of their Affiliates, or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
arising out of or otherwise relating to the Facilities, the actual or proposed
use of the proceeds of the Term Advances, the Loan Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

            (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender other
than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Term Advance, as a result
of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.05, 2.08(b)(i) or 2.09(d),
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 6.01 or for any
other reason, or if the Borrowers fail to make any payment or prepayment of a
Term Advance for which a notice of prepayment has been given or that is
otherwise required to be made, whether pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.05 or 6.01 or
otherwise, the Borrowers shall, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender any amounts required to compensate such Lender for any
additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur as a result of
such payment or Conversion or such failure to pay or prepay, as the case may be,
including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any
Lender to fund or maintain such Term Advance.

            (d) If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or
other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount may be
paid on behalf of such Loan Party by any Agent or any Lender, in its sole
discretion.

            (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any
Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties contained in Sections
2.09 and 2.11, Sections 7.06 and 7.09 and this Section 9.04 shall survive the
payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder
and under any of the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 9.05. Right of Set-off. Upon (a) the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.01, each Agent and each Lender and each of their
respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Agent, such Lender or such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Borrower or any other Loan
Party against any and all of the Obligations of such Borrower or such Loan Party
now or hereafter existing under the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether such
Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or such
Note or Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured. If such deposits
are not pledged pursuant to a valid security agreement, the prior written
consent of the Administrative Agent shall be obtained before any right of
set-off shall be exercised. Each Agent and each Lender agrees promptly to notify
such Borrower or such Loan Party after any such set-off and application;
provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Agent and each
Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section 9.05 are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Agent, such Lender and their respective Affiliates may have.

            SECTION 9.06. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by the Initial Borrower and each Guarantor
named on the signature pages hereto and the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by the Initial Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Borrower and
Guarantor named on the signature pages hereto and each Agent and each Lender

                                       75
<PAGE>

and their respective successors and assigns, except that no Borrower or any
other Loan Party shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any
interest herein without the prior written consent of the Lenders.

            SECTION 9.07. Assignments and Participations; Replacement Notes. (a)
At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date, each Lender
may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Term Commitment, the Term Advances owing to it and the Notes held
by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a uniform,
and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under and in respect
of the Term Facility, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that,
immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender, an Affiliate of any Lender
or a Fund Affiliate of any Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, the aggregate amount of the Term
Commitments being assigned to such Eligible Assignee pursuant to such assignment
(determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment) shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof (or such lesser amount as shall be approved by the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of effectiveness of such assignment, the Borrowers),
(iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) no such
assignments shall be permitted at any time without the consent of the
Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (v)
the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register, an
Assignment and Acceptance, together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment and, except if such assignment is being made by a Lender to an
Affiliate or Fund Affiliate of such Lender, a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500.

            (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from
and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (i)
the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender, hereunder and (ii)
the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance,
relinquish its rights (other than its rights under Sections 2.09, 2.11, 7.06,
7.09, 8.05, and 9.04 to the extent any claim thereunder relates to an event
arising prior to such assignment) and be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of
the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

            (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, each
Lender assignor thereunder and each assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties thereto and hereto as follows: (i) other
than as provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes
no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Loan
Document or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or priority of any lien or security
interest created or purported to be created under or in connection with, any
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;
(ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of any Loan Party or the
performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of its obligations under any
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto;
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of

                                       76
<PAGE>

the financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning Lender or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms that it is an
Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes each Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion
under the Loan Documents as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and
thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders and the Term Commitment of, and principal amount of the Term
Advances owing to, each Lender from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries
in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Agents and the Lenders may treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
the Borrowers or any Agent or any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject to
such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit D
hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information
contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the
Borrowers and each other Agent. In the case of any assignment by a Lender,
within five Business Days after their receipt of such notice, each Borrower, at
its own expense, shall, if requested by the applicable Lender, execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or
Notes a substitute Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount
equal to the Term Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance and, if any assigning Lender has retained a Term Commitment
hereunder, a substitute Note to the order of such assigning Lender in an amount
equal to the Term Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such substitute Note or
Notes, if any, shall be in an aggregate principal amount up to the aggregate
principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective
date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially
the form of Exhibit A hereto.

            (f) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more Persons
(other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Term Commitment, the Term Advances owing to
it and the Note or Notes held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Term
Commitment) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of any such Note for all purposes of
this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agents and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v) no participant under
any such participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver
of any provision of any Loan Document, or any

                                       77
<PAGE>

consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, except to the extent that
such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal of, or interest on,
the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the
extent subject to such participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment
of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable
hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation, or release
all or substantially all of the Collateral and (vi) if, at the time of such
sale, such Lender was entitled to payments under Section 2.11(a) in respect of
United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes
that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in
Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to such
participant on such date, provided that such participant complies with the
requirements of Section 2.11(e) as if it were a Lender hereunder.

            (g) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant any information relating to the Loan Parties (or any of them)
furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of any Loan Party; provided, however,
that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed
assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any
Confidential Information received by it from such Lender.

            (h) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Term
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

            (i) Upon notice to the Borrowers from the Administrative Agent or
any Lender of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of any Lender's Note,
the Borrowers will execute and deliver, in lieu of such original Note, a
replacement promissory note, identical in form and substance to, and dated as of
the same date as, the Note so lost, stolen or mutilated, subject to delivery by
such Lender to the Borrowers of an affidavit of lost note and indemnity in
customary form. Upon the execution and delivery of the replacement Note, all
references herein or in any of the other Loan Documents to the lost, stolen or
mutilated Note shall be deemed references to the replacement Note.

            SECTION 9.08. Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of an original executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.09. Confidentiality. Neither any Agent nor any Lender
shall disclose any Confidential Information to any Person without the consent of
the Borrowers, other than (a) to such Agent's or such Lender's Affiliates and
their officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors and to actual or
prospective Eligible Assignees and participants, and then only on a confidential
basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or regulation or judicial process, (c)
as requested or required by any state, Federal or foreign authority or examiner
regulating such Lender and (d) to any rating agency when required by it,
provided that, prior to any such

                                       78
<PAGE>

disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality
of any Confidential Information relating to the Loan Parties received by it from
such Lender.

            SECTION 9.10. Release of Collateral. (a) Upon the sale, lease,
transfer or other disposition of any item of Collateral of any Loan Party
(including, without limitation, (i) as a result of the sale of the Equity
Interests in the Loan Party that owns such Collateral, and (ii) any Transfer
pursuant to Section 5.02(e)) that is permitted in accordance with the terms of
the Loan Documents, then, in either such event, the Collateral Agent will, at
the Borrowers' expense, execute and deliver to such Loan Party such documents as
such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of
Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the
Collateral Document in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

            (b) Upon the latest to occur of (i) the payment in full in cash of
the Secured Obligations, (ii) the termination or expiration of all Secured Hedge
Agreements, and (iii) the Maturity Date, the Liens granted by the Collateral
Documents shall terminate and all rights to the Collateral shall revert to the
applicable Loan Party. Upon any such termination, the Collateral Agent will, at
the Borrowers' expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Parties such
documents as such Loan Parties shall reasonably request to evidence such
termination.

            SECTION 9.11. Patriot Act Notification. Each Lender and each Agent
(for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies the Loan Parties
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "PATRIOT ACT"), it is required
to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party, which
information includes the name and address of such Loan Party and other
information that will allow such Lender or such Agent, as applicable, to
identify such Loan Party in accordance with the Patriot Act. The Loan Parties
shall, and shall cause each of their Subsidiaries to, provide, to the extent
commercially reasonable, such information and take such actions as are
reasonably requested by any Agents or any Lenders in order to assist the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders in maintaining compliance with the Patriot
Act.

            SECTION 9.12. Jurisdiction, Etc. (a) Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or Federal court of
the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State
court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall
affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the
courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or Federal
court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent

                                       79
<PAGE>

permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

            SECTION 9.13. Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

            SECTION 9.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE BORROWERS, THE OTHER
LOAN PARTIES, THE AGENTS AND THE LENDERS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, THE
TERM ADVANCES OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY AGENT OR ANY LENDER IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
