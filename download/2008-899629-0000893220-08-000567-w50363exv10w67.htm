be insufficient for the payment of such obligations in full, Borrower, within five (5)&nbsp;days after

contained shall be deemed to affect any right or remedy of Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders
under the provisions of this Agreement or the other Loans Documents or of any statute or rule of

interest in any and all monies now or hereafter deposited in such reserves and the account
established by Administrative Agent as additional security for the payment of the Loans and agrees

procured from the appropriate public office (with respect to Real Estate Taxes), insurer or agent

strictly to applicable usury laws. Accordingly, all agreements between Borrower, Administrative
Agent and the Lenders with respect to the Loans are hereby expressly limited so that in no event,
whether by reason of acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be
paid to Administrative Agent or any Lender or charged by any Lender for the use, forbearance or
detention of the money to be lent hereunder or otherwise, exceed the maximum amount allowed by law.
If the Loans would be usurious under Applicable Law (including the laws of the State and the laws
of the United States of America), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Loan
Documents: (1)&nbsp;the aggregate of all consideration which constitutes interest under Applicable Law
that is contracted for, taken, reserved, charged or received under the Loan Documents shall under
no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by Applicable Law, and any excess
shall be credited on the Notes by the holders thereof (or, if the Notes have been paid in full,
refunded to Borrower); and (2)&nbsp;if maturity is accelerated by reason of an election by
Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, or in the event of
any prepayment, then any consideration which constitutes interest may never include more than
the maximum amount allowed by Applicable Law. In such case, excess interest, if any, provided for
in the Loan Documents or otherwise, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, shall be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread from the date of advance until payment in full so that the actual
rate of interest is uniform through the term hereof. If such amortization, proration, allocation
and spreading is not permitted under Applicable Law, then such excess interest shall be cancelled
automatically as of the date of such acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be
credited on the Notes (or, if the Notes have been paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms
and provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;12.3</U> shall control and supersede every other provision of
the Loan Documents. Except as otherwise expressly provided therein, the Loan Documents are
contracts made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the
State of New York, except that if at any time the laws of the United States of America permit the
Lenders to contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive a higher rate of interest than is allowed
by the laws of the State of New York (whether such federal laws directly so provide or refer to the
law of any state), then such federal laws shall to such extent govern as to the rate of interest
which the Lenders may contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive under the Loan Documents.

part thereof; the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full effect and shall not be
affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance therefrom; and in
lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there shall be added automatically as a

management of Borrower, the powers of Administrative Agent and the Lenders being limited to the
rights to exercise the remedies referred to in the Loan Documents. The relationship between
Borrower and the Lenders is, and at all times shall remain, solely that of debtor and creditor. No
covenant or provision of the Loan Documents is intended, nor shall it be deemed or construed, to
create a partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income between
Administrative Agent, the Lenders, Lead Borrower and Borrower. Administrative Agent and the
Lenders neither undertake nor assume any responsibility or duty to Borrower or to any other person
with respect to the Loans, the Project or the other collateral for the Loans, except as expressly
provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents: (1)
neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender is, nor shall be construed as, a partner, joint
venturer, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other business associate or participant of any
kind of Borrower or any Borrower Party or any of their respective stockholders, members, or
partners, and neither Administrative Agent nor any Lender intends to ever assume such status; (2)
no Lender or Administrative Agent shall in any event be liable for any Debts, expenses or losses
incurred or sustained by Borrower or any Borrower Party; and (3)&nbsp;no Lender or Administrative Agent
shall be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Borrower or
any Borrower Party or any of their respective stockholders, members, or partners. Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and Borrower disclaim any intention to create any partnership, joint venture,

Administrative Agent to take any actions with the powers conveyed by this proxy. This proxy shall,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Condominium Documents, be irrevocable prior to the
repayment in full of all of the Indebtedness.
