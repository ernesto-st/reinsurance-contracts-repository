and substance, reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS

2.4   The obligations of each Lender are several and the failure by a Lender to
perform its obligations hereunder and/or under any Letter of Credit issued
hereunder shall not affect the obligations of either Obligor towards any other
party hereto nor shall any other party be liable for the failure by such Lender

(b)   If a change in any currency of a country occurs, this Agreement will be
      amended in the manner determined by the Agent (acting reasonably) so as to

4.7   At any time after the issue of a Bilateral Letter of Credit by a Declining
Lender the Account Party may give the Agent and the Declining Lender not less
than fourteen days' prior written notice of its intention to procure that the
liability of the Declining Lender under such Letter of Credit is reduced to zero
(whereupon it shall do so).

REVISED LETTERS OF CREDIT

4.8   In the event that the Funds at Lloyd's Requirements of an Applicant
changes at or around the time of any given Funds Date in terms of amount and/or
the identity of the Applicant, subject to the approval of Lloyd's and subject to

to the extent reasonably possible that the Letters of Credit provide for the
revised Funds at Lloyd's Requirements of the Applicants.


                                                                         Page 18

outstanding Bilateral Letters of Credit having an aggregate principal amount at
least equal to the increase are cancelled at the time the increase takes effect.

documentation is executed.

PAYMENT OF DEMANDS

DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES

5.1(a)The Agent shall, within a reasonable time following its receipt thereof,
      examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under
      any Letter of Credit. The Agent shall promptly after such examination (and
      in any event by 12 noon on the Business Day immediately following receipt
      of such demand) (i) notify each of the Lenders and the Account Party by
      facsimile of such demand for payment and (ii) deliver to each Lender and
      the Account Party a copy of each document purporting to represent a demand
      for payment under such Letter of Credit.

      Lender will make an LC Disbursement in respect of such Letter of Credit in
      accordance with its liability under such Letter of Credit and this
      Agreement, such LC Disbursement to be made to the account of the Agent
      most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders
      within two Business Days of receipt of a demand for payment under such
      Letter of Credit by the Agent;

(c)   The Agent will and undertakes to each Lender that it will:

        (i) make any such LC Disbursement available to Lloyd's as the
            beneficiary of such Letter of Credit by promptly crediting the
            amounts so received from the Lenders, in like funds, to the account
            identified by Lloyd's in connection with such demand for payment on
            the date following two Business Days after the receipt by the Agent
            of such demand; and

       (ii) notify each Lender on the third Business Day after the receipt by

      Letter of Credit, the Agent will notify the Account Party of such LC
      Disbursement provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such
      notice shall not relieve the Account Party of their obligation to
      reimburse the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

RIGHT TO MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER LETTERS OF CREDIT

5.2   Each Lender shall be entitled to make any payment in accordance with the
terms of the relevant Letter of Credit without any reference to or further
authority from the Account Party or any other investigation or enquiry.

LIABILITY OF LENDERS

5.3   Neither the Agent, nor any Lender nor any of their Related Parties shall
have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the
issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make
any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in
the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond their control; provided that the
foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Agent or a Lender from liability
to any Obligor to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Obligors to the
extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by any Obligor that are caused by
the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent or a Lender. The parties
hereto expressly agree that:

(a)   the Agent may accept documents that appear on their face to be in
      substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without
      responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
      information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of
      documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with
      the terms of such Letter of Credit;

(b)   the Agent shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to
      accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not
      in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and

(c)   this Clause shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by the
      Agent when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under
      a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto
      hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any standard of
      care inconsistent with the foregoing).

      terms of any Letter of Credit requested by the Account Party; and

      operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of the obligations of
      the Account Party set out in this Clause 6 or any of the rights, powers or
      remedies conferred upon any Lender by this Agreement or by law.

laws of general application and, if any such security or payment is so avoided
or reduced, such Lender shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of such
security or payment from the Account Party subsequently as if such settlement or
discharge had not occurred.

withholding of tax, in which case the sum payable by such Obligor (in respect of
which such deduction or withholding is required to be made) shall be increased
to the extent necessary to ensure that such Finance Party receives a sum net of
any deduction or withholding equal to the sum which it would have received had
no such deduction or withholding been made or required to be made.

TAX INDEMNITY

10.2  Without prejudice to Clause 10.1 (TAX GROSS-UP), if any Finance Party is
required to make any payment of or on account of tax on or in relation to any
sum received or receivable hereunder (including any sum deemed for purposes of
tax to be received or receivable by such Finance Party whether or not actually
received or receivable) or if any liability in respect of any such payment is

Party shall, upon demand of the Agent, promptly indemnify the Finance Party
which

<PAGE>

suffers a loss or liability as a result against such payment or liability,
together with any interest, penalties, costs and expenses payable or incurred in
connection therewith, PROVIDED THAT this Clause 10.2 shall not apply to:

      received or receivable by such Finance Party by the jurisdiction in which
      such Finance Party is incorporated; or

(b)   any tax imposed on and calculated by reference to the net income of the

assignment, on the date on which the relevant transfer or assignment becomes

TAX RECEIPTS

NOTIFICATION OF REQUIREMENT TO DEDUCT TAX

11.1  If, at any time, an Obligor is required by law to make any deduction or
withholding from any sum payable by it hereunder (or if thereafter there is any
change in the rates at which or the manner in which such deductions or
withholdings are calculated), such Obligor shall promptly, upon becoming aware
of the same, notify the Agent.

EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT OF TAX

11.2  If an Obligor makes any payment hereunder in respect of which it is
required to make any deduction or withholding, it shall pay the full amount
required to be deducted or withheld to the relevant taxation or other authority
within the time allowed for such payment under applicable law and shall deliver
to the Agent for each Lender, within thirty days after it has made such payment
to the applicable authority, an original receipt (or a certified copy thereof)
issued by such authority evidencing the payment to such authority of all amounts
so required to be deducted or withheld in respect of that Lender's share of such
payment.

TAX CREDIT PAYMENT

11.3  If an additional payment is made under Clause 10 (TAXES) by an Obligor for
the benefit of any Finance Party and such Finance Party, in its sole discretion,
determines that it has obtained (and has derived full use and benefit from) a
credit against, a relief or remission


                                                                         Page 24
<PAGE>

for, or repayment of, any tax, then, if and to the extent that such Finance
Party, in its sole opinion, determines that:

(a)   such credit, relief, remission or repayment is in respect of or calculated
      with reference to the additional payment made pursuant to Clause 10
      (TAXES); and

(b)   its tax affairs for its tax year in respect of which such credit, relief,
      remission or repayment was obtained have been finally settled,

such Finance Party shall, to the extent that it can do so without prejudice to
the retention of the amount of such credit, relief, remission or repayment, pay
to such Obligor such amount as such Finance Party shall, in its sole opinion,
determine to be the amount which will leave such Finance Party (after such
payment) in no worse after-tax position than it would have been in had the
additional payment in question not been required to be made by such Obligor.

TAX CREDIT CLAWBACK

11.4  If any Finance Party makes any payment to an Obligor pursuant to Clause
11.3 (TAX CREDIT PAYMENT) and such Finance Party subsequently determines, in its
sole opinion, that the credit, relief, remission or repayment in respect of
which such payment was made was not available or has been withdrawn or that it
was unable to use such credit, relief, remission or repayment in full, the
Obligor shall reimburse such Finance Party such amount as such Finance Party
determines, in its sole opinion, is necessary to place it in the same after-tax
position as it would have been in if such credit, relief, remission or repayment
had been obtained and fully used and retained by such Finance Party.

TAX AND OTHER AFFAIRS

11.5  No provision of this Agreement shall interfere with the right of any
Finance Party to arrange its tax or any other affairs in whatever manner it
thinks fit, oblige any Finance Party to claim any credit, relief, remission or
repayment in respect of any payment under Clause 10.1 (TAX GROSS-UP) in priority
to any other credit, relief, remission or repayment available to it nor oblige
any Finance Party to disclose any information relating to its tax or other
affairs or any computations in respect thereof.

(b)   compliance (without adopting materially less prudent policies or standards
      than those previously adopted by it) by any Lender or by the holding

            funding or maintaining any Letters of Credit made or to be made by

then and in each such case:

            (A) the Lender shall notify the Account Party through the Agent of
                the relevant event promptly upon becoming aware of the event
                giving details of any costs or amount likely to be demanded
                under paragraph (B);

            (B) promptly following any demand from time to time by that Lender
                through the Agent, the Account Party shall pay to the Agent for

available or fund or maintain or to give effect to its obligations as
contemplated by this Agreement or the Letters of Credit (or, by reason only of a
Change of Law, the Lender ceases to be an Approved Credit Institution), the
Lender shall promptly on becoming aware of the same give notice thereof to the
Account Party through the Agent, whereupon:

(a)   where such change makes it unlawful or contrary to an official directive
      to maintain or give effect to its obligations under this Agreement, if the
      Agent on behalf of such Lender so requires, the Account Party shall by no
      later than the last day of any


                                                                         Page 26
<PAGE>

      applicable grace period specified by the applicable Law ensure that the
      liabilities of such Lender under or in respect of each Letter of Credit
      are cancelled within the meaning of Clause 1.2(l)(i)(A) (or use its best
      efforts to ensure that such liabilities are cancelled within the meaning
      of Clause 1.2(l)(i)(C)), the Commitment of that Lender shall forthwith be
      cancelled and the Account Party shall prepay forthwith fees, costs and
      expenses due to that Lender hereunder;

(b)   where such change only makes it unlawful or contrary to an official
      directive to participate in further Letters of Credit under this
      Agreement, then upon receipt by the Agent of that notice, the Available
      Commitment of that Lender shall be reduced to zero, and upon the expiry of
      each Letter of Credit in which it is participating at such time, its
      resulting Available Commitment shall also be cancelled, provided that if
      the Lender subsequently transfers or assigns its rights and obligations
      under this Agreement to a new lender pursuant to Clause 26.5 (RIGHTS TO
      SUBSTITUTE A SINGLE BANK), the Account Party may by notice to the Agent
      increase the Commitment of such new lender by the amount of the Available
      Commitment that was previously cancelled.

MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

DESIGNATION OF A DIFFERENT LENDING OFFICE

14.1  If any Lender requests compensation under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS), or
if the Account Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or
any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Clause 10
(TAXES), then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Letters of Credit hereunder or to
transfer its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
branches or Affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (a) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS) or 10 (TAXES), as the case may be, in the future
and (b) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Account Party hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS

14.2  If any Lender requests compensation under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS), or
if any Account Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or
any Governmental Authority for account of any Lender pursuant to Clause 10
(TAXES), or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to make LC Disbursements
hereunder, or if any Lender ceases to be an Approved Credit Institution, then
the Account Party may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such
Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Clause
26.5 (RIGHT TO SUBSTITUTE SINGLE LENDER)), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an Approved Credit Institution that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that:

(a)   the Account Party shall have received the prior written consent of the
      Agent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld;

(b)   such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
      outstanding amount of its LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon,
      accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the
      assignee (to the extent of such outstanding


                                                                         Page 27
<PAGE>

      principal and accrued interest and fees) or the relevant Account Party (in
      the case of all other amounts); and

(c)   in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
      under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS) or payments required to be made pursuant
      to Clause 10 (TAXES), such assignment will result in a reduction in such
      compensation or payments.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the relevant Account Party to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.

PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF SET-OFFS.

PAYMENTS BY THE ACCOUNT PARTY

15.1(a) The Account Party shall make each payment required to be made by them
        hereunder or under any other Finance Document (except to the extent
        otherwise provided therein) in Sterling on the date when due, in
        immediately available cleared funds, without set-off or counterclaim
        (and in the case of payments required pursuant to Clause 6, by 11.00
        a.m. on the due date). Any amounts received after such time on any date
        may, in the discretion of the Agent, be deemed to have been received on
        the next succeeding Business Day for the purposes of calculating
        interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Agent at the
        account most recently notified by it, except payments pursuant to
        Clauses 12 (INCREASED Costs), 10 (TAXES), 24 (COSTS AND EXPENSES) and 25
        (INDEMNITIES), which shall be made directly to the Persons entitled
        thereto. The Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for
        account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly
        following receipt thereof.

(b)     If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business
        Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding
        Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest
        thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.

CURRENCY

15.2  All amounts payable under this Agreement in respect of any Letter of
Credit shall be payable in Sterling.

APPLICATION OF INSUFFICIENT PAYMENTS

15.3  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Agent to pay fully all Demand Amounts, interest, fees and expenses then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied:

(a)   FIRST, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid fees, costs, expenses,
      indemnity payments and other amounts due to the Agent and the Security
      Trustee under the Finance Documents;

(b)   SECONDLY, in or towards payment pro rata of any unpaid costs and expenses
      of the Lenders under the Finance Documents;

(c)   THIRDLY, in or towards payment pro rata of any outstanding fees (other
      than Letter of Credit Fees) payable to the Lenders under the Finance
      Documents;


                                                                         Page 28
<PAGE>

(d)   FOURTHLY, in or towards payment pro rata of all accrued Letter of Credit
      Fees due to Issuing Lenders but unsatisfied under this Agreement;

(e)   FIFTHLY, in or towards payment pro rata of any interest on Demand Amounts;

(f)   SIXTHLY, in or towards payment pro rata of Demand Amounts;

(g)   SEVENTHLY, in or towards payment pro rata of any principal (other than a
      Demand Amount) due but unsatisfied under this Agreement (including, for
      the avoidance of doubt, any cash cover to be provided under a Letter of
      Credit); and

(h)   EIGHTHLY, in or towards payment pro rata of any other sum due but
      unsatisfied under this Agreement.

PRO RATA TREATMENT

15.4  Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

(a)   each reimbursement of LC Disbursements shall be made to the Lenders, each
      payment of fees under Clause 9 (FEES) shall be made for account of the
      Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the Commitments under Clause
      8 (TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF THE COMMITMENTS) shall be applied to the
      respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to their
      respective Commitments; and

(b)   each payment of interest shall be made for account of the Lenders pro rata
      in accordance with the amounts of interest then due and payable to the
      respective Lenders.

SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS

15.5  If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or
otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any LC Exposures resulting in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its
LC Exposures and accrued interest thereon then due than the proportion received
by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the LC Exposures of other
Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall
be shared by the Lenders rateably in accordance with the aggregate amount of LC
Exposures; provided that:

(a)   if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
      payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be
      rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery,
      without interest; and

(b)   the provisions of this Clause shall not be construed to apply to any
      payment made by any Obligor pursuant to and in accordance with the express
      terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as
      consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in LC
      Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Account
      Party or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions
      of this paragraph shall apply).

Each Obligor consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Account Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Account


                                                                         Page 29
<PAGE>


Party in the amount of such participation and the Obligors authorise the Lenders
to exchange Transfer Certificates and any other documentation to give effect to
those purchases of participations.

PRESUMPTIONS OF PAYMENT

15.6  Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any party prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Agent hereunder that the payor will not
make such payment, the Agent may assume that the payor has made such payment on
such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the relevant payee the amount due. In such event, if the payor has
not in fact made such payment, then each of the payees severally agrees to repay
to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to that payee with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the
Agent's cost of funds from such sources as the Agent may reasonably select.

CERTAIN DEDUCTIONS BY THE AGENT

15.7  If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Clause 15.5 (SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS), then the Agent may, in
its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Agent for account of such Lender to satisfy
such Lender's obligations under such Clauses until all such unsatisfied
obligations are fully paid.

GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY

GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY

16.1  The Guarantors, jointly and severally, irrevocably and unconditionally:

(a)   guarantee to each Finance Party the due and punctual payment from time to
      time on demand any and every sum or sums of money which the Account Party
      is at any time liable to pay to any Finance Party under or pursuant to the
      Finance Documents and which has become due and payable but has not been
      paid at the time such demand is made (the GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS); and

(b)   agree as a primary obligation to indemnify each Finance Party from time to
      time on demand from and against any loss incurred by any Finance Party as
      a result of any of the obligations of the Account Party under or pursuant
      to the Finance Documents being or becoming void, voidable, unenforceable
      or ineffective as against the Account Party for any reason whatsoever,
      whether or not known to any Finance Party or any other person, the amount
      of such loss being the amount which the person or persons suffering it
      would otherwise have been entitled to recover from the Account Party.

ADDITIONAL SECURITY

16.2  The obligations of each Guarantor herein contained shall be in addition to
and independent of every other security which any Finance Party may at any time
hold in respect of any of the Account Party's obligations under the Finance
Documents.


                                                                         Page 30
<PAGE>

CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS

16.3  The obligations of each Guarantor herein contained shall constitute and be
continuing obligations notwithstanding any settlement of account or other matter
or thing whatsoever and shall not be considered satisfied by any intermediate
payment or satisfaction of all or any of the obligations of the Account Party
under the Finance Documents and shall continue in full force and effect until
final payment in full of all amounts owing by the Account Party under this
Agreement and total satisfaction of all the Account Party's actual and
contingent obligations under the Finance Documents.

OBLIGATIONS NOT DISCHARGED

16.4  Neither the obligations of the Guarantors herein contained nor the rights,
powers and remedies conferred in respect of the Guarantors upon any Finance
Party by the Finance Documents or by law shall be discharged, impaired or
otherwise affected by:

(a)   the winding-up, dissolution, administration or re-organisation of the
      Account Party or any other person or any change in its status, function,
      control or ownership;

(b)   any of the obligations of the Account Party or any other person under the
      Finance Documents or under any other security taken in respect of any of
      its obligations under the Finance Documents being or becoming illegal,
      invalid, unenforceable or ineffective in any respect;

(c)   time or other indulgence being granted or agreed to be granted to any
      Obligor in respect of its obligations under the Finance Documents or under
      any such other security;

(d)   any amendment to, or any variation, waiver or release of, any obligation
      of any Obligor under the Finance Documents or under any such other
      security;

(e)   any failure to take, or fully to take, any security contemplated hereby or
      otherwise agreed to be taken in respect of the Obligors' obligations under
      the Finance Documents;

(f)   any failure to realise or fully to realise the value of, or any release,
      discharge, exchange or substitution of, any security taken in respect of
      the Obligors' obligations under the Finance Documents; or

(g)   any other act, event or omission which, but for this Clause 16.4, might
      operate to discharge, impair or otherwise affect any of the obligations of
      any Guarantor herein contained or any of the rights, powers or remedies
      conferred upon any of the Finance Parties by the Finance Documents or by
      law.

SETTLEMENT CONDITIONAL

16.5  Any settlement or discharge between any Obligor and any of the Finance
Parties shall be conditional upon no security or payment to any Finance Party by
the Account Party or any other person on behalf of the Account Party being
avoided or reduced by virtue of any laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation or similar laws of general application and, if any such security or
payment is so avoided or reduced, each Finance Party shall be entitled to
recover the value or amount of such security or payment from the Account Party
subsequently as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.


                                                                         Page 31
<PAGE>

EXERCISE OF RIGHTS

16.6  No Finance Party shall be obliged before exercising any of the rights,
powers or remedies conferred upon them in respect of any Guarantor by the
Finance Documents or by law to:

(a)   make any demand of the Account Party or any other Obligor;

(b)   take any action or obtain judgment in any court against the Account Party
      or any other Obligor;

(c)   make or file any claim or proof in a winding-up or dissolution of the
      Account Party or any other Obligor; or

(d)   enforce or seek to enforce any other security taken in respect of any of
      the obligations of the Account Party or any other Obligor under the
      Finance Documents.

DEFERRAL OF GUARANTOR'S RIGHTS

16.7  Each Guarantor agrees that, so long as any amounts are or may be owed by
the Account Party under the Finance Documents or the Account Party is under any
actual or contingent obligations under the Finance Documents, it shall not
exercise any rights which it may at any time have by reason of performance by it
of its obligations under the Finance Documents:

(a)   to be indemnified by the Account Party; and/or

(b)   to claim any contribution from any other Guarantor of the Account Party's
      obligations under the Finance Documents; and/or

(c)   to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation
      or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance
      Documents or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection
      with, this Agreement by all or any of the Finance Documents.

RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION

16.8  The Guarantors (other than the Account Party) hereby agree, as between
themselves, that if any such Guarantor shall become an Excess Funding Guarantor
(as defined below) by reason of the payment by such Guarantor of any Guaranteed
Obligations, each other Guarantor (other than the Account Party) shall, on
demand of such Excess Funding Guarantor (but subject to the next sentence), pay
to such Excess Funding Guarantor an amount equal to such Guarantor's Pro Rata
Share (as defined below and determined, for this purpose, without reference to
the properties, debts and liabilities of such Excess Funding Guarantor) of the
Excess Payment (as defined below) in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations. The
payment obligation of a Guarantor to any Excess Funding Guarantor under this
Clause shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of the obligations of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this
Clause 16 and such Excess Funding Guarantor shall not exercise any right or
remedy with respect to such excess until payment and satisfaction in full of all
of such obligations.

For purposes of this Clause, (i) EXCESS FUNDING GUARANTOR means, in respect of
any Guaranteed Obligations, a Guarantor that has paid an amount in excess of its
Pro Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) EXCESS PAYMENT means, in
respect of any Guaranteed


                                                                         Page 32
<PAGE>

Obligations, the amount paid by an Excess Funding Guarantor in excess of its Pro
Rata Share of such Guaranteed Obligations and (iii) PRO RATA SHARE means, for
any Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of (x) the amount by which
the aggregate present fair saleable value of all properties of such Guarantor
(excluding any shares of stock of any other Guarantor) exceeds the amount of all
the debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated,
unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder and any obligations of any other Guarantor that have been
Guaranteed by such Guarantor) to (y) the amount by which the aggregate fair
saleable value of all properties of all of the Guarantors (other than the
Account Party) exceeds the amount of all the debts and liabilities (including
contingent, subordinated, unmatured and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding
the obligations of the Guarantors under this Clause 16) of all of the Guarantors
(other than the Account Party), determined (A) with respect to any Guarantor
that is a party hereto on the date hereof, as of the date hereof, and (B) with
respect to any other Guarantor, as of the date such Guarantor becomes a
Guarantor hereunder.

GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS

16.9  In any action or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any
state or Federal bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation or other law in any
other jurisdiction affecting the rights of creditors generally, if the
obligations of any Guarantor under Clause 16.1 (GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY) would
otherwise, taking into account the provisions of Clause 16.8, be held or
determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, or subordinated to the claims
of any other creditors, on account of the amount of its liability under Clause
16.1 (GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY), then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof
to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action
by such Guarantor, any Lender, the Agent or any other Person, be automatically
limited and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not
subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

17.1  Each Obligor represents and warrants to the Lenders on the date of this
Agreement, the Closing Date and 1 December of each year unless no extension is
to occur on December 31 of such year (with reference to the facts and
circumstances subsisting on each such date) as follows.

ORGANISATION; POWERS

17.2  It and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organised, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation, has all
requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted and,
except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to
do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such
qualification is required.

AUTHORISATION: ENFORCEABILITY

17.3  The Transactions are within such Obligor's corporate powers and have been
duly authorised by all necessary corporate and, if required, by all necessary
shareholder action. Each Finance Document to which such Obligor is party has
been duly executed and delivered by such Obligor and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of such Obligor, enforceable against such Obligor in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (a)
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganisation, moratorium or similar laws of general
applicability affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and (b) the
application of


                                                                         Page 33
<PAGE>

general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS

17.4  The Transactions (a) do not require any consent or approval of (including
any exchange control approval), registration or filing with, or any other action
by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been obtained or made and
are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any applicable law or
regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organisational documents of such
Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries or any order of any Governmental Authority,
(c) will not violate or result in a default under any material indenture,
agreement or other instrument binding upon such Obligor or any of its
Subsidiaries or assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by any such Person, and (d) will not result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien on any asset of such Obligor or any of its
Subsidiaries.

FINANCIAL CONDITION; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE

17.5(a) FINANCIAL CONDITION. Such Obligor has heretofore furnished to the
        Lenders the consolidated balance sheet and statements of income,
        shareholders' equity and cash flows of such Obligor and its consolidated
        Subsidiaries (i) as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1998
        and December 31, 1999, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
        independent public accountants (as provided in the Account Party's
        Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the fiscal year ended
        December 31, 1999), and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter ended June
        30, 2000, as provided in the Account Party's Report on Form 10-Q filed
        with the SEC for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2000. Such financial
        statements (and any further such statements delivered pursuant to Clause
        18.1(a) and (b)) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
        position and results of operations and cash flows of such Obligor and
        its respective consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such
        periods (or the dates or periods to which any such further statements
        relate) in accordance with GAAP or (in the case of XL Europe, XL
        Insurance or XL Mid Ocean) SAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments
        and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to
        in (ii) of the first sentence of this paragraph.

(b)     NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE. Since December 31, 1999, there has been no
        material adverse change in the assets, business, financial condition or
        operations of such Obligor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

PROPERTIES

17.6(a) PROPERTY GENERALLY. Such Obligor and each of its Subsidiaries has good
        title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal
        property material to its business, subject only to Liens permitted by
        Clause 19.3 (LIENS) and except for minor defects in title that do not
        interfere with its ability to conduct its business as currently
        conducted or to utilise such properties for their intended purposes.

(b)     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. Such Obligor and each of its Subsidiaries owns,
        or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents
        and other intellectual property material to its business, and the use
        thereof by such Obligor and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the
        rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that,
        individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
        result in a Material Adverse Effect.


                                                                         Page 34
<PAGE>

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

17.7(a) ACTIONS, SUITS AND PROCEEDINGS. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2 Part C
        or as routinely encountered in claims activity, there are no actions,
        suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
        Authority now pending against or, to the knowledge of such Obligor,
        threatened against or affecting such Obligor or any of its Subsidiaries
        (i) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
        determination and that could reasonably be expected, individually or in
        the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that
        involve the Finance Documents or the Transactions.

(b)     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2 Part D and
        except with respect to any other matters that, individually or in the
        aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect, neither such Obligor nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has
        failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or
        comply with any permit, license or other approval required for its
        business under any Environmental Law, (ii) has incurred any
        Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with
        respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for
        any Environmental Liability.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND AGREEMENTS

17.8  Such Obligor and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its
property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding upon it or
its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

INVESTMENT AND HOLDING COMPANY STATUS

17.9  Such Obligor is not (a) an INVESTMENT COMPANY as defined in, or subject to
regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a HOLDING COMPANY as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company

Material Adverse Effect.

ERISA

17.11 No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when
taken together with all other such ERISA Events for which liability is
reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated benefit
obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of
the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed the fair
market value of the assets of such Plan by an amount that could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.


                                                                         Page 35

Effect, (i) all contributions required to be made by any Obligor or any of their
Subsidiaries with respect to a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan have been timely made, (ii)
each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and
with the requirements of any and all applicable laws and has been maintained,
where required, in good standing with the applicable Governmental Authority and
(iii) neither any Obligor nor any of their Subsidiaries has incurred any
obligation in connection with the termination or withdrawal from any Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan.

DISCLOSURE

17.12 The reports, financial statements, certificates or other information
furnished by such Obligor to the Lenders in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement or any other Finance Document or delivered hereunder (taken as a
whole) do not contain any material misstatement of fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with
respect to projected financial information, such Obligor represents only that
such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to
be reasonable at the time.

USE OF CREDIT

17.13 Neither such Obligor nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally,
or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending credit for
the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying or carrying
Margin Stock, and no Letter of Credit will be used in connection with buying or
carrying any Margin Stock.

Subsidiaries of the Account Party as of the date hereof, together with, for each
such Subsidiary, (i) the jurisdiction of organisation of such Subsidiary, (ii)
each Person holding ownership interests in such Subsidiary and (iii) the
percentage of ownership of such Subsidiary represented by such ownership
interests. Except as disclosed in Schedule 3, (x) each of the Account Party and
its Subsidiaries owns, free and clear of Liens, and has the unencumbered right
to vote, all outstanding ownership interests in each Person shown to be held by
it in Schedule 5, (y) all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of each
such Person organised as a corporation is validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and (z) except as disclosed in filings of the Account Party with
the SEC prior to the date hereof, there are no outstanding Equity Rights with
respect to any Obligor.

to the Agent, as of the date hereof, the payment of the LC Disbursements and
interest thereon, the fees under Clause 9 (FEES) and all other amounts payable
hereunder will not be subject, by withholding or deduction, to any Taxes imposed
by any Obligor Jurisdiction.

STAMP TAXES

17.16 To ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in
evidence of the Finance Documents, it is not necessary that the Finance
Documents or any other document be filed or recorded with any Governmental
Authority or that any stamp or similar tax be paid on or in respect of any of
the Finance Documents, or any other document other than such filings


                                                                         Page 36

that have already been paid.

Obligor Jurisdiction for the admissibility thereof in the courts of such Obligor
Jurisdiction.

CLAIMS PARI PASSU

17.18 Under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation in force at the date
hereof, the claims of the Finance Parties against it under this Agreement or any
other Finance Document will rank at least PARI PASSU with the claims of all its
other unsecured and unsubordinated creditors save those whose claims are
preferred solely by any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar
laws of general application.

      shall satisfy the financial statement delivery requirements of this
      paragraph (a) to deliver the annual financial statements of the Account
      Party so long as the financial information required to be contained in
      such Report is substantially the same as the financial information

      statements present fairly in all material respects the financial condition

      case of XL Europe, XL Insurance and XL Mid Ocean) SAP, as the case may be,
      consistently applied, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the
      absence of footnotes (it being understood that delivery to the Lenders of
      the Account Party's Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC shall satisfy
      the financial statement delivery requirements of this paragraph (b) to
      deliver the quarterly financial statements of the Account Party so long as
      the financial information required to be contained in such Report is

      if a Default has occurred, specifying the details thereof and any action
      taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto, (ii) setting forth
      reasonably detailed calculations demonstrating compliance with Clauses
      19.3 (LIENS), 19.5 (RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITALISATION),

      whether any change in GAAP or (in the case of XL Europe, XL Insurance and
      XL Mid Ocean) SAP or in the application thereof has occurred since the
      date of the audited financial statements referred to in Clause 17.5(a)
      and, if any such change has occurred, specifying the effect of such change

      18.1(a), a certificate of the accounting firm that reported on such
      financial statements stating whether they obtained knowledge during the
      course of their examination of such financial statements of any Default
      (which certificate may be limited to the extent required by accounting
      rules or guidelines);

      which are subject to Liens permitted under Clause 19.3(g) (LIENS) and the
      aggregate book value of liabilities which are subject to Liens permitted
      under Clause 19.3(g) (it being understood that the reports required by
      paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Clause shall satisfy the requirement (i) of
      this Clause 18.1(f) if such reports set forth separately, in accordance
      with GAAP, line items corresponding to such aggregate book values) and
      (ii) a calculation showing the portion of each of such aggregate amounts
      which portion is attributable to transactions among wholly-owned
      Subsidiaries of the Account Party; and

(g)   promptly following any request therefor, such other information regarding
      the operations, business affairs and financial condition of the Account
      Party or any of its


                                                                         Page 38
<PAGE>

      Subsidiaries, or compliance with the terms of this Agreement, as the Agent
      or any Lender may reasonably request.

NOTICES OF MATERIAL EVENTS

18.2 Each Obligor will furnish to the Agent and each Lender prompt written
notice of the following:

(a)   the occurrence of any Default; and

(b)   any event or condition constituting, or which could reasonably be expected
      to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Each notice delivered under this Clause shall be accompanied by a statement of a
Financial Officer or other executive officer of the relevant Obligor setting
forth the details of the event or development requiring such notice and any
action taken or proposed to be taken by such Obligor with respect thereto.

PRESERVATION OF EXISTENCE AND FRANCHISES

18.3  Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain
its corporate existence and its material rights and franchises in full force and
effect in its jurisdiction of incorporation except where the failure to maintain
such corporate existence and material rights and franchises would not reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger or
consolidation permitted under Clause 19.1 (MERGERS) or 19.2 (DISPOSITIONS). Each
Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, qualify and remain
qualified as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which failure to
receive or retain such qualification would have a Material Adverse Effect.

INSURANCE

18.4  Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain
with financially sound and reputable insurers, insurance with respect to its
properties in such amounts as is customary in the case of corporations engaged
in the same or similar businesses having similar properties similarly situated.

MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES

18.5  Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain or
cause to be maintained in good repair, working order and condition the
properties now or hereafter owned, leased or otherwise possessed by and used or
useful in its business and will make or cause to be made all needful and proper
repairs, renewals, replacements and improvements thereto so that the business
carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times except
if the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect, provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not impose on such Obligor or any Subsidiary
of such Obligor any obligation in respect of any property leased by such Obligor
or such Subsidiary in addition to such Obligor's obligations under the
applicable document creating such Obligor's or such Subsidiary's lease or
tenancy.

PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER POTENTIAL CHARGES AND PRIORITY CLAIMS PAYMENT OF
OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES

18.6  Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay or
discharge:

<PAGE>

(a)   on or prior to the date on which penalties attach thereto, all taxes,
      assessments and other governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or
      any of its properties or income;

(b)   on or prior to the date when due, all lawful claims of materialmen,
      mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other like Persons which,
      if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien upon any such property;
      and

(c)   on or prior to the date when due, all other lawful claims which, if
      unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien upon any such property
      (other than Liens not forbidden by Clause 19.3 (LIENS)) or which, if
      unpaid, might give rise to a claim entitled to priority over general
      creditors of such Obligor in any proceeding under the Bermuda Companies
      Law or Bermuda Insurance Law, or any insolvency proceeding, liquidation,
      receivership, rehabilitation, dissolution or winding-up involving such
      Obligor or such Subsidiary;

provided that, unless and until foreclosure, distraint, levy, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced, such Obligor need not pay or discharge
any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim so long as the validity thereof
is contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted
and so long as such reserves or other appropriate provisions as may be required
by GAAP or SAP, as the case may be, shall have been made therefor and so long as
such failure to pay or discharge does not have a Material Adverse Effect.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

18.7  Such Obligor will, and will cause each of its consolidated Subsidiaries
to, make and keep books, records and accounts which, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and dispositions of its assets
and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements required under Clause 18.1 (FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION) in conformity with GAAP and SAP, as
applicable, and to maintain accountability for assets.

COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS

18.8  Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with
all applicable Laws (including but not limited to the Bermuda Companies Law and
Bermuda Insurance Laws) in all respects; provided that such Obligor or any
Subsidiary of such Obligor will not be deemed to be in violation of this Clause
as a result of any failure to comply with any such Law which would not (i)
result in fines, penalties, injunctive relief or other civil or criminal
liabilities which, in the aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect or
(ii) otherwise impair the ability of such Obligor to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

USE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

18.9  No Letter of Credit will be used, whether directly or indirectly, for any
purpose that entails a violation of any of the Regulations of the Board,
including Regulations U and X.

CONTINUATION OF AND CHANGE IN BUSINESSES

18.10 Each Obligor and its Subsidiaries will continue to engage in substantially
the same business or businesses it engaged in (or proposes to engage in) on the
date of this Agreement and businesses related or incidental thereto.


                                                                         Page 40
<PAGE>

VISITATION

18.11 Each Obligor will permit such Persons as any Lender may reasonably
designate to visit and inspect any of the properties of such Obligor, to discuss
its affairs with its financial management, and provide such other information
relating to the business and financial condition of such Obligor at such times
as such Lender may reasonably request. Each Obligor hereby authorises its
financial management to discuss with any Lender the affairs of such Obligor.

NEGATIVE COVENANTS

19.   Until the Total Commitments have expired or terminated and all fees
payable hereunder have been paid in full and all Letters of Credit have expired
or terminated and all LC Disbursements have been reimbursed, each of the
Obligors covenants and agrees with the Lenders that:

except that if no Default shall occur and be continuing or shall exist at the
time of such merger or consolidation or immediately thereafter and after giving
effect thereto any Obligor may merge or consolidate with any other corporation,
including a Subsidiary, if such Obligor shall be the surviving corporation.

DISPOSITIONS

19.2  No Obligor will, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell,
convey, assign, lease, abandon or otherwise transfer or dispose of, voluntarily

Disposition), any of its properties or assets, tangible or intangible (including
but not limited to sale, assignment, discount or other disposition of accounts,
contract rights, chattel paper or general intangibles with or without recourse),

      or other assets classified on such Obligor's balance sheet as available
      for sale;

(b)   sales, conveyances, assignments or other transfers or dispositions in
      immediate exchange for cash or tangible assets, provided that any such
      sales, conveyances or transfers shall not individually, or in the
      aggregate for the Obligor and their respective Subsidiaries, exceed
      $500,000,000 in any calendar year;

(c)   Dispositions of equipment or other property which is obsolete or no longer
      used or useful in the conduct of the business of such Obligor or its
      Subsidiaries;

      Subsidiaries; or

(e)   Dispositions with Affiliates in accordance with Clause 19.4(c)
      (TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES).


                                                                         Page 41

incur, assume or permit to exist any Lien on any property or assets, tangible or

      thereto  and  proceeds  thereof,  and (ii) the  aggregate  amount of the
      obligations  secured by all such Liens on any particular property at any
      time purchased by such Obligor, as applicable,  shall not exceed 100% of
      the lesser of the fair  market  value of such  property  at such time or
      the actual purchase price of such property;

      Adverse Effect.

otherwise than by reason of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct, in
acting in its capacity as agent hereunder.

EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES

21.6  Except in the case of gross negligence or wilful default, neither the
Agent nor the Arranger accepts any responsibility:

(a)   for the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information supplied
      by the Agent or the Arranger, by an Obligor or by any other person in
      connection with the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement
      or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to

NO ACTIONS

21.7  Each of the Lenders agree that it will not assert or seek to assert
against any director, officer or employee of the Agent or the Arranger any claim
it might have against any of them in respect of the matters referred to in
Clause 21.6 (EXCLUSION OF LIABILITIES).

BUSINESS WITH THE GROUP

21.8  The Agent and the Arranger may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any of the
Obligors or their Subsidiaries.

RESIGNATION

21.9  The Agent may resign its appointment hereunder at any time without
assigning any reason therefor by giving not less than thirty days' prior notice
to that effect to each of the other parties hereto, PROVIDED THAT no such
resignation shall be effective until a successor for the Agent is appointed in
accordance with the succeeding provisions of this Clause 21.

SUCCESSOR AGENT

21.10 If the Agent gives notice of its resignation pursuant to Clause 21.9
(RESIGNATION) then any reputable and experienced Lender or other financial
institution may be appointed as a successor to the Agent by the Majority Lenders
(with the approval of the Account Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed,) during the period of such notice (with the co-operation of the Agent)
but, if no such successor is so appointed, the Agent may appoint such a
successor itself.

RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

21.11 If a successor to the Agent is appointed under the provisions of Clause
21.10 (SUCCESSOR AGENT), then (a) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from
any further obligation hereunder but shall remain entitled to the benefit of the

hereto shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they
would have had if such successor had been a party hereto.

OWN RESPONSIBILITY

been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent

      nature of each member of the Group;

(c)   whether such Lender has recourse, and the nature and extent of that
      recourse, against an Obligor or any other person or any of its assets
      under or in connection with the Finance Documents, the Transactions or any
      other agreement, arrangement or


                                                                         Page 50
<PAGE>

      document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, pursuant to or
      in connection with the Finance Documents; and

(d)   the adequacy, accuracy and/or completeness of any information provided by
      the Agent or the Arranger, an Obligor or by any other person in connection
      with the Finance Documents, the Transactions or any other agreement,
      arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of,
      pursuant to or in connection with the Finance Documents.

Accordingly, each Lender acknowledges to the Agent and the Arranger that it has
not relied on and will not hereafter rely on the Agent and the Arranger or
either of them in respect of any of these matters.

AGENCY DIVISION SEPARATE

21.13 In acting as agent hereunder for the Lenders, the Agent shall be regarded
as acting through its agency division which shall be treated as a separate
entity from any other of its divisions or departments and, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Clause 21, any information received by some other
division or department of the Agent may be treated as confidential and shall not
be regarded as having been given to the Agent's agency division.

DECLARATION OF AGENT AS SECURITY TRUSTEE

21.14 The Agent hereby declares that it shall hold:

(a)   all rights, titles and interests that may hereafter be mortgaged, charged,
      assigned or otherwise secured in favour of the Agent by or pursuant to the
      Finance Documents;

(b)   the benefit of all representations, covenants, guarantees, indemnities and
      other contractual provisions given in favour of the Agent (other than any
      such benefits given to the Agent solely for its own benefit) by or
      pursuant to the Finance Documents (other than this Agreement); and

(c)   all proceeds of the security referred to in paragraph (a) above and of
      the enforcement of the benefits referred to in paragraph (b) above,

on trust for itself and the other Finance Parties from time to time.

Such declaration shall remain valid notwithstanding that the Agent may on the
date hereof or at any other time be the sole Finance Party; for the avoidance of
doubt, however, such declaration shall, in such case, be deemed repeated on each
date on which the Agent ceases to be the sole Finance Party.

Each of the parties hereto agrees that the obligations, rights and benefits
vested or to be vested in the Agent as trustee as aforesaid by the Finance
Documents or any document entered into pursuant thereto shall (as well before as
after enforcement) be performed and (as the case may be) exercised by the Agent
in accordance with the provisions of this Clause 21.

trustees by the Trustee Act 1925 (to the extent not inconsistent herewith) and
by way of supplement it is expressly declared as follows:

      any company whose business includes undertaking the safe custody of
      documents or any firm of lawyers of good repute;

(b)   the Agent may, whenever it thinks fit, delegate by power of attorney or
      otherwise to any person or persons or fluctuating body of persons all or
      any of the rights, trusts, powers, authorities and discretions vested in
      it by any of the Finance Documents and such delegation may be made upon
      such terms and subject to such conditions (including the power to
      sub-delegate) and subject to such regulations as the Agent may think fit
      and the Agent shall not be bound to supervise, or be in any way
      responsible for any loss incurred by reason of any misconduct or default
      on the part of, any such delegate (or sub-delegate);

(c)   notwithstanding anything else herein contained, the Agent may refrain from
      doing anything which would or might in its opinion be contrary to any law
      of any jurisdiction or any directive or regulation of any agency of any

      may do anything which is, in its opinion, necessary to comply with any
      such law, directive or regulation;

      liabilities, costs, fees, charges, losses and expenses incurred by any of

      other matter or thing done or omitted to be done in any way relating to
      any of the Finance Documents or pursuant to any law or regulation; and

(e)   without prejudice to the provisions of any of the Finance Documents, the
      Agent shall not be under any obligation to insure any property or to
      require any other person to maintain any such insurance and shall not be

      of the lack of or inadequacy or insufficiency of any such insurance.

(a)   to require the deposit with it of any deed or document certifying,

require the Account Party to remedy any defect in the Account Party's right or
title as aforesaid.

NEW SECURITY TRUSTEE

21.18 The Agent may at any time appoint any person (whether or not a trust

      Lenders; or

(b)   for the purposes of conforming to any legal requirements, restrictions or
      conditions which the Agent deems relevant for the purposes of the Finance
      Documents and the Agent shall give prior notice to the Account Party and
      the Lenders of any such appointment.

Any person so appointed shall (subject to the provisions of the Finance
Documents) have such powers, authorities and discretions and such duties and
obligations as shall be conferred or imposed or such person by the instrument of

The Agent shall have power in like manner to remove any person so appointed.

Such reasonable remuneration as the Agent may pay to any person so appointed,

      Lender's behalf has been duly authorised by all necessary action on the
      part of the Lender;

(b)   the obligations of the Lender under each Letter of Credit constitute its
      legal, valid and binding obligations; and

WAIVERS AND AMENDMENTS

NO DEEMED WAIVERS

23.1  No failure or delay by any Finance Party in exercising any right or power
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. No waiver of any provision
of this Agreement or consent to any departure by an Obligor therefrom shall in
any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Clause 23.3
(AMENDMENTS), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Agent or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

23.2  The rights and remedies of the Finance Parties hereunder are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.

AMENDMENTS

23.3  Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or
modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Obligors and the Majority Lenders or by the Obligors and the Agent with
the consent of the Majority Lenders; PROVIDED that no such agreement shall:

       (i)  increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written  consent
            of such Lender,

      (ii)  reduce the amount of any reimbursement obligation of the Account
            Party in respect of any LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of
            interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the
            written consent of each Lender affected thereby,

     (iii)  postpone the scheduled date for reimbursement of any LC
            Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable
            hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such
            payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
            Commitment or any Letter of Credit (other than an extension thereof
            pursuant to Clause 4), without the written consent of each Lender
            affected thereby,


                                    Page 55
<PAGE>

      (iv)  change Clause 15.4 (PRO RATA TREATMENT) or 15.5 (SHARING OF PAYMENTS
            BY LENDERS) without the consent of each Lender affected thereby,

       (v)  release any of the Guarantors from any of their guarantee
            obligations under Clause 16 (GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY) without the
            written consent of each Lender,

       (vi) release any security granted by the Account Party pursuant to Clause
            19.8 (RATINGS DOWNGRADE) or 20.1 (EVENTS OF DEFAULT) without the
            written consent of each Lender, and

      (vii) change any of the provisions of this Clause or the percentage in the
            definition of the term MAJORITY LENDERS or any other provision
            hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to
            waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
            determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written
            consent of each Lender;

and PROVIDED FURTHER that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Agent hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Agent.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

24.1   The Account Party shall pay:

(a)   all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and charges incurred by the Agent
      and/or the Arranger (together with VAT or any similar tax thereon and
      including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for
      the Agent) in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities
      provided for herein, the negotiation, preparation, execution and
      administration of the Finance Documents (subject to the terms of the
      Commitment Letter) or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the
      provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or
      thereby shall be consummated);

(b)   all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent, the Security
      Trustee or any Lender, (together with VAT or any similar tax thereon and
      including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one legal

      connection with the preservation and/or enforcement or protection of its
      rights in connection with the Finance Documents, including its rights
      under this Clause, or in connection with Letters of Credit issued
      hereunder, including in connection with any workout, restructuring or
      negotiations in respect thereof.

STAMP DUTY

24.2  The Account Party shall pay all transfer, stamp, documentary or other
similar taxes, assessments or charges levied by any governmental or revenue
authority in respect of this Agreement or any other document referred to herein.

INDEMNITIES

CURRENCY INDEMNITY

25.1(a) If:


                                                                         Page 56
<PAGE>

        (i) any amount payable by the Account Party under or in connection with
            this Agreement is received by any Finance Party in a currency (the
            PAYMENT CURRENCY) other than that agreed in this Agreement (the
            AGREED CURRENCY) whether as a result of any judgement or order or
            the enforcement thereof, the liquidation of the payer or otherwise;
            and

       (ii) the amount produced by converting the Payment Currency so received
            into the Agreed Currency is less than the relevant amount of the
            Agreed Currency.

      then the Account Party shall, as an independent obligation, indemnify such
      Finance Party for the deficiency and any loss sustained as a result. Such
      conversion shall be made at such prevailing rate of exchange, on such date
      and in such market as is determined by such Finance Party (acting
      reasonably) as being most appropriate for the conversion. The Account
      Party shall in addition pay the costs of the conversion.

(b)   The Account Party waives any right it may have in any jurisdiction to pay
      any amount under this Agreement in a currency other than that in which it
      is expressed to be payable in this Agreement.

OTHER INDEMNITIES

25.2  The Obligors shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
INDEMNITEE) against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of:

(a)   the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
      contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their
      respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions
      or any other transactions contemplated hereby;

(b)   any Letter of Credit or the use of any thereof (including any refusal by
      any Lender to honour a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the
      documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply
      with the terms of such Letter of Credit);

(c)   any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
      relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any
      other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
      provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available
      to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
      expenses result from or arise out of the gross negligence or wilful
      misconduct of such Indemnitee.

REIMBURSEMENT BY LENDERS

25.3  To the extent that the Obligors fail to pay any amount required to be paid
by them to the Agent under Clauses 25 (COSTS AND EXPENSES) or 25.1 (CURRENCY
INDEMNITY) and 25.2 (OTHER INDEMNITIES), each Lender severally agrees to pay to
the Agent such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that
the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
unpaid amount; PROVIDED that the unreimbursed


                                                                         Page 57

ALTERATION TO THE PARTIES

SUCCESSORS

26.1  The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby.

ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS BY THE ACCOUNT PARTY

26.2  The Account Party shall not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and
any attempted assignment or transfer by the Account Party without such consent
shall be null and void).

TRANSFERS BY LENDERS.

26.3(a) Any Lender (the TRANSFEROR) may at any time transfer to another Approved
        Credit Institution (the TRANSFEREE) all or a portion of its rights and
        obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
        Commitment) and under any Letter of Credit to which it is a party;
        PROVIDED THAT:

        (i) except in the case of an transfer to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate,
            each of the Account Party and the Agent must give their prior
            written consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be
            unreasonably withheld or delayed);

       (ii) except in the case of an transfer to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate
            or a transfer of the entire remaining amount of the Transferor's
            Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the Transferor subject
            to each such transfer (determined as of the date of the Transfer
            Certificate) shall not be less than (pound)3,000,000 unless each of
            the Account Party and the Agent otherwise consent;

      (iii) a transfer of obligations shall only be effective if the Transferee
            has confirmed to the Agent and the Account Party prior to the
            transfer taking effect that it undertakes to be bound by the terms
            of this Agreement as Lender in form and substance reasonably
            satisfactory to the Agent and the Account Party; and on any such
            transfer being made the Transferor shall be relieved of its
            obligations to the extent they are transferred to the Transferee;

       (iv) the Transferee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver relevant
            contact, notice and account details to the Agent (with a copy to the
            Account Party);

      PROVIDED FURTHER that any consent of the Account Party otherwise required
      under this paragraph shall not be required if an Event of Default under
      Clause 20.1(a), (e) or (f) has occurred and is continuing. Upon transfer
      pursuant to Clause 26.4, from and after the last to occur of (i) the
      effective date specified in each Transfer Certificate; and (ii) the
      cancellation of a Letter of Credit and the issue of a new Letter of Credit
      with the Transferee identified as an Issuing Lender, the Transferee
      thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the lesser of the
      interest assigned by such Transfer Certificate and the Transferee's
      participation as an Issuing lender of a re-issued Letter of Credit (the
      TRANSFERRED INTEREST), have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
      this Agreement, and the Transferor


                                                                         Page 58
<PAGE>

      thereunder shall, to the extent of the Transferred Interest, be released
      from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of Transfer
      Certificate covering all of the Transferor's rights and obligations under
      this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
      continue to be entitled to the benefits of Clauses 12 (INCREASED COSTS),
      10 (TAXES) 24 (COSTS AND EXPENSES) and 25 (INDEMNITIES)). Any assignment
      or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
      does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
      Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
      obligations in accordance with Clause 26.7 (PARTICIPATIONS).

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a
      GRANTING LENDER) may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an SPV) of such
      Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the
      Granting Lender to the Agent and the Account Party, the option to provide
      to the Account Party all or any part of any LC Disbursement that such
      Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Account Party
      pursuant to Clause 2.1, PROVIDED that (i) nothing herein shall constitute
      a commitment by any SPV to make any LC Disbursement, (ii) if an SPV elects
      not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part
      of such LC Disbursement, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make
      such LC Disbursement pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Account
      Party may bring any proceeding against either or both the Granting Lender
      or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of the Account Party hereunder;
      and (iv) the SPV shall agree to the terms of Clause 30.2
      (CONFIDENTIALITY). The making of an LC Disbursement by an SPV hereunder
      shall utilise the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent,
      and as if, such LC Disbursement were made by the Granting Lender. Each
      party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any payment
      under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so
      long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender makes such
      payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees
      (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that,
      prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
      of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any
      SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in
      instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganisation, arrangement,
      insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the
      laws of the United States or any State thereof arising out of any claim
      against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained in this Clause, any SPV may with notice
      to, but without the prior written consent of, the Account Party or the
      Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a
      portion of its interests in any Letter of Credit to its Granting Lender or
      to any financial institutions (consented to by the Account Party and the
      Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with respect to
      commercial paper issued by such SPV to issue such Letters of Credit and
      such SPV may disclose, on a confidential basis, confidential information
      with respect to any Account Party and its Subsidiaries to any rating
      agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or
      credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. This paragraph may not be
      amended without the consent of any SPV at the time holding LC
      Disbursements under this Agreement.

(b)   On each occasion a Transferor assigns, transfers or novates any of its
      rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, the Transferee (unless it
      is already a Lender or a Lender Affiliate immediately prior to the
      transfer) shall ensure that the Agent has notice of the same and shall, on
      the date the assignment, transfer and/or novation takes effect, pay to the
      Agent for its own account a fee of (pound)1,000.


                                                                         Page 59
<PAGE>

(c)   Neither a Transferor nor any other Finance Party is responsible to a
      Transferee for:

        (i) the execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or sufficiency
            of any Finance Documents or any other document;

       (ii) the collectability of amounts payable under any Finance Documents or
            the financial condition of or the performance of its obligations
            under the Finance Documents by any Obligor; or

      (iii) the accuracy of any statements or information (whether written or
            oral) made in or in connection with or supplied in connection with
            any Finance Documents.

(d)   Each Transferee confirms to the Transferor and the other Finance Parties
      that it:

        (i) has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the
            financial condition and affairs of each Obligor and its related
            entities in connection with its participation in this Agreement and
            has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the
            Transferor or any other Finance Party in connection with any Finance
            Documents; and

       (ii) will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the
            creditworthiness of each Obligor and its related entities for so
            long as there are any Commitments or LC Exposures under this
            Agreement.

(e)   Nothing in any Finance Document obliges a Transferor to:

        (i) accept a re-transfer from an Transferee of any of the rights and/or
            obligations assigned, transferred or novated under this clause; or

       (ii) support any losses incurred by the Transferee by reason of the
            non-performance by any Obligor of its obligations under any Finance
            Document or otherwise.

26.4  TRANSFER PROCEDURE:

(a)   A novation is effected if:

        (i) the Transferor and the Transferee deliver to the Agent a duly
            completed Transfer Certificate executed by the Transferor and the
            Transferee,; and

       (ii) the Agent executes it.

(b)   Each Party (other than the Transferor and the Transferee) irrevocably
      authorises the Agent to execute any duly completed Transfer Certificate on
      its behalf.

(c)   To the extent that they are  expressed to be the subject of the novation
      in the Transfer Certificate:

        (i) the Transferor and the other Parties (the EXISTING PARTIES) will be
            released from their obligations to each other under the Finance
            Documents (the DISCHARGED OBLIGATIONS);


                                                                         Page 60
<PAGE>

       (ii) the Transferee and the existing Parties will assume obligations
            towards each other under the Finance Documents which differ from the
            discharged obligations only insofar as they are owed to or assumed
            by the Transferee instead of the Transferor;

      (iii) the rights of the Transferor against the existing Parties under the
            Finance Documents and vice versa (the DISCHARGED RIGHTS) will be
            cancelled; and

       (iv) the Transferee and the existing Parties will acquire rights against
            each other under the Finance Documents which differ from the
            discharged rights only insofar as they are exercisable by or against
            the Transferee instead of the Transferor,

      all on the date specified in the proviso to Clause 26.3(a).

RIGHT TO SUBSTITUTE SINGLE LENDER

26.5  If:

(a)   any sum payable to any Finance Party by the Account Party is required to
      be increased under Clause 10 (TAXES); or

(b)   any Lender claims indemnification from the Account Party under Clause 12.1
      (INCREASED COSTS); or

(c)   a Lender's Available Commitment has been reduced to zero pursuant to
      Clause 13(b) (ILLEGALITY),

the Account Party may give the Agent notice of its intention to arrange the
substitution of that Lender with a new bank or financial institution.

On receipt of a notice from the Account Party referred to above, the Lender
shall use its best endeavours to promptly assign or transfer all of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement to an Approved Credit Institution nominated
by the Account Party. Such transfer will be effected in accordance with Clause
26.4 (TRANSFER PROCEDURE) and the consideration for such transfer shall be an
amount equal to the sum of all amounts accrued and owing by the Account Party to
the transferring Lender as calculated on the date of transfer.

REFERENCE BANKS

26.6  If a Reference Bank ceases to be one of the Lenders, the Agent shall (in
consultation with the Account Party) appoint another Lender or an affiliate of a
Lender to replace that Reference Bank.

PARTICIPATIONS

26.7  Any Lender may sell participations to one or more Lenders or other
entities (a PARTICIPANT) in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the other Credit Documents (including all
or a portion of its Commitment); PROVIDED that:

        (i) any such participation sold to a Participant which is not a Lender
            or a Lender Affiliate shall be made only with the consent (which in
            each case shall not be unreasonably withheld) of the Account Party
            and the Agent, unless an Event


                                                                         Page 61
<PAGE>

            of Default under Clause 20.1(a), (e) or (f) has occurred and is
            continuing, in which case the consent of the Account Party shall not
            be required;

       (ii) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the other Finance
            Documents shall remain unchanged;

      (iii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
            hereto for the performance of such obligations;

       (iv) the Account Party, the Agent, the Security Trustee and the other
            Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender
            in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
            Agreement and the other Finance Documents; and

        (v) the Participant shall agree to the terms of Clause 30.2
            (CONFIDENTIALITY).

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and the other Finance Documents and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
other Finance Documents; PROVIDED that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Clause 23.3
(AMENDMENTS) that affects such Participant. Subject to Clause 26.8 (NO INCREASED
COSTS), the Obligors agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Clauses 12 (INCREASED COSTS) and 10 (TAXES) to the same extent as if
it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Clause
26.3 (TRANSFERS BY LENDERS).

NO INCREASED COSTS

26.8  No Participant or Transferee shall be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Clause 12 (INCREASED COSTS) and 10 (TAXES) than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such Participant or the Lender interest transferred.

CERTAIN PLEDGES

26.9  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, and this Clause shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a
security interest; PROVIDED that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

NO TRANSFERS TO ANY ACCOUNT PARTY OR AFFILIATES

26.10 Anything in this Clause to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender may
assign or participate any interest in any LC Exposure held by it hereunder to
any Obligor or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries without the prior consent
of each Lender.

MAINTENANCE OF REGISTER BY THE AGENT

26.11 The Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Account Party, shall
maintain at one of its offices in London a copy of each Transfer Certificate
delivered to it and a register of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and
the Commitment of, and principal amount of the LC Disbursements owing to, each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time


                                                                         Page 62
<PAGE>

(the REGISTER). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Account
Party, the Agent, the Security Trustee and the Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by any Account Party
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

SET OFF

RIGHT OF SET-OFF

27.   If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Finance
Party is hereby authorised at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits in any
currency (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness in any currency at any time owing by such Finance
Party to or for the credit or the account of any Obligor against any of and all
the obligations of such Obligor now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
held by such Finance Party, irrespective of whether or not such Finance Party
shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations
may be unmatured. The rights of each Finance Party under this Clause are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) which
such Finance Party may have. The relevant Finance Party may effect any
appropriate currency exchanges to implement such set-off.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

CERTIFICATES

28.1  Any determination or notification by the Agent or any other Finance Party
concerning any rate or amount under the Finance Documents shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be conclusive evidence as to that matter.

SURVIVAL

28.2  All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the
Account Party herein and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in
connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been
relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless
of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as any
fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid
or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Clauses 12 (INCREASED COSTS), 10
(TAXES), 24 (COSTS AND EXPENSES), 25 (INDEMNITIES) and 21 (AGENT) shall survive
and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, the expiration or termination of the Letters
of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

COUNTERPARTS

28.3  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties
hereto on separate counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original,
but all of which when taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.


                                                                         Page 63

ENTIRE AGREEMENT

28.4  This Agreement and the other Finance Documents constitute the entire
contract between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof.

SEVERABILITY

28.5  Any provision of this Agreement or any other Finance Document held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof. The invalidity of a particular provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Obligor hereby
waives any provision of Law which renders any provision of the Finance Documents
prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

GOVERNING LAW

29.1  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by
      English law.

JURISDICTION

29.2(a) All the parties agree that the courts of England are, subject to Clause
        29.2(b) and (c) below, to have jurisdiction to settle any disputes which
        may arise in connection with the creation, validity, effect,
        interpretation or performance of, or the legal relationships established
        by, this Agreement (including, without limitation, claims for set-off or
        counterclaim) or otherwise arising in connection with this Agreement and
        for such purposes irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the English
        courts;

(b)     notwithstanding the agreement in (a) above, each of the Finance Parties
        shall retain the right to bring proceedings in any other court which has
        jurisdiction whether by virtue of the Convention on Jurisdiction and the
        Enforcement of Judgments signed on 27 September 1968 (as from time to
        time amended and extended) or by virtue of the Convention on
        Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments signed on 16 September
        1988 (from time to time amended and extended) or otherwise;

(c)     with respect to the courts agreed in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, each
        of the Parties irrevocably waives any objections on the ground of venue
        or forum non conveniens or any similar ground;

(d)     each of the Parties irrevocably agrees that a judgment or order of any
        court referred to in this clause in connection with this Agreement is
        conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in the
        courts of any other jurisdiction; and

(e)     each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by mail
        or in any other manner permitted by the relevant Law.

and any other documents in proceedings in England or any other proceedings in

                                                                         Page 64
<PAGE>

Axe, London EC3A 8NL and any writ, judgment or other notice of legal process
shall be sufficiently served on the relevant Obligor if delivered to such agent
marked for the attention of the Finance Director at its address for the time
being. Each Obligor undertakes not to revoke the authority of the above agent
without promptly appointing a successor and notifying the Agent thereof.

WAIVER OF IMMUNITIES

29.4  To the extent that any Obligor has or hereafter may acquire any immunity
from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution
or execution, on the ground of sovereignty or otherwise) with respect to itself
or its property, it hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, such immunity in respect of its obligations under the Finance
Documents.

TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY

TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

30.1  Each of the Obligors acknowledges that from time to time financial
advisory, investment banking and other services may be offered or provided to
any Obligor or one or more of their Subsidiaries (in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise) by any Lender or by one or more subsidiaries or
affiliates of such Lender and each of the Obligors hereby authorises each Lender
to share any information delivered to such Lender by such Obligor and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement, or in connection with the decision of
such Lender to enter into this Agreement, to any such subsidiary or affiliate,
it being understood that (a) any such information shall be used only for the
purpose of advising the Obligor or preparing presentation materials for the
benefit of the Obligor and (b) any such subsidiary or affiliate receiving such
information shall be bound by Clause 30.2 (CONFIDENTIALITY) as if it were a
Lender hereunder. Such authorisation shall survive the expiration or termination
of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination of this
Agreement or any provision hereof.

CONFIDENTIALITY

30.2  Each of the Finance Parties agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed:

(a)   to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents,
      including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
      understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
      informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to
      keep such Information confidential);

(b)   to the extent requested by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction
      over the Agent or any Lender;

(c)   to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any
      subpoena or similar legal process;

(d)   to any other party to this Agreement;

(e)   in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
      action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of
      rights hereunder;


                                                                         Page 65
<PAGE>

(f)   subject to an agreement in writing containing provisions substantially the
      same as those of this paragraph and for the benefit of the Obligor, to (i)
      any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
      Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or
      (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap
      or derivative transaction relating to any Obligor and its obligations;

(g)   with the consent of the Obligor; or

(h)   to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than
      as a result of a breach of this Clause 30.2 or (ii) becomes available to
      the Agent or any Lender on a non-confidential basis from a source other
      than an Obligor.

For the purposes of this Clause, INFORMATION means all information received from
an Obligor relating to an Obligor or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Finance Parties on a non-confidential basis
prior to disclosure by such Obligor; PROVIDED that, in the case of information
received from an Obligor after the date hereof, such information is clearly
identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Clause shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Finance Parties agree that they will
not trade the securities of any of the Obligors based upon non-public
Information that is received by them.

the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any of its terms.

                                   SCHEDULE 4

                              MANDATORY COSTS RATE

The mandatory costs rate is an addition to the interest rate on an Demand Amount
to compensate the Lenders for the cost attributable to an Demand Amount
resulting from the imposition from time to time under or pursuant to the Bank of
England Act 1998 (the ACT) and/or by the Bank of England and/or the Financial
Services Authority (the FSA) (or other United Kingdom governmental authorities
or agencies) of a requirement to place non-interest-bearing deposits or Special
Deposits (whether interest-bearing or not) with the Bank of England and/or pay
fees to the FSA calculated by reference to liabilities used to fund the Demand
Amount.

The mandatory costs rate will be the rate determined by the Agent (rounded
upward, if necessary, to four decimal places) as the rate resulting from the
application (as appropriate) of the following formula:

                           XL+S(L-D)+Fx 0.01
                           -----------------
                               100-(X+S)

where, in each case, on the day of application of a formula:

X     is the percentage of Eligible Liabilities (in excess of any stated
      minimum) by reference to which the Agent is required under or pursuant to
      the Act to maintain cash ratio deposits with the Bank of England;

L     is the percentage rate per annum at which sterling deposits for the
      relevant period are offered by the Agent to leading banks in the London
      Interbank Market at or about 11.00 a.m. on that day;

F     is the rate of charge payable by the Agent to the FSA pursuant to
      paragraph 2.02 of the Fees Regulations (but for this purpose the figure at
      paragraph 2.02b shall be deemed to be zero) and expressed in pounds per
      (pound)1 million of the Fee Base of the Agent;

S     is the level of interest-bearing Special Deposits, expressed as a
      percentage of Eligible Liabilities, which the Agent is required to
      maintain by the Bank of England (or other United Kingdom governmental
      authorities or agencies); and

D     is the percentage rate per annum payable by the Bank of England to the
      Agent on Special Deposits.

(X, L, S and D are to be expressed in the formula as numbers and not as
percentages. A negative result obtained from subtracting D from L shall be
counted as zero.)

The mandatory costs rate attributable to a Demand Amount or other sum for any
period shall be calculated at or about 11.00 a.m. (London time) on the first day
of such period for the duration of such period.

The determination of the mandatory costs rate in relation to any period shall,
in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto.


                                                                         Page 73
<PAGE>

If there is any change in circumstance (including the imposition of alternative
or additional requirements) which in the reasonable opinion of the Agent renders
or will render either of the above formulae (or any element thereof, or any
defined term used therein) inappropriate or inapplicable, the Agent (following
consultation with the Account Party and the Majority Banks) shall be entitled to
vary the same. Any such variation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive and binding on all parties and shall apply from the date specified in
such notice.

For the purposes of this Schedule:

      The terms ELIGIBLE LIABILITIES and SPECIAL DEPOSITS shall bear the
      meanings ascribed to them under or pursuant to the Act or by the Bank of
      England (as may be appropriate), on the day of the application of the
      formula.

      FEE BASE has the meaning ascribed to it for the purposes of, and shall be
      calculated in accordance with, the Fees Regulations.

      FEES REGULATIONS means, as appropriate, either:

      (a)   the Banking Supervision (Fees) Regulations 1998;  or

      (b)   such regulations as from time to time may be in force, relating to
            the payment of fees for banking supervision in respect of periods
            subsequent to 31 March 1999.






                                                                         Page 74

future, actual or contingent) in relation to the Finance Documents, the Security

Deposit together with any interest thereon in respect of any period after the
security has become enforceable towards the discharge of the Secured Obligations
in such manner as it deems fit.

PRIMARY SECURITY

5.    The Deposit shall be deemed to constitute primary and not collateral
security and the security shall not be discharged or impaired by:

(a)   the dealing with, existence or validity of any other security taken by the

      Obligations or any enforcement of or failure to take, perfect or enforce

      Chargor's liability under, this Deed including any act, omission or thing
      which would or might afford an equitable defence to a security.

OTHER SECURITY

6.    The security hereby created is a continuing security notwithstanding any
intermediate payment or settlement of account for the payment and discharge of
the Secured Obligations and is in addition to and shall neither be merged in,
nor in any way exclude or prejudice any other Security Interest, right of
recourse, set off, combination or other right or interest whatsoever which the

apart from this Deed hold or have) as regards the Chargor or any other person in
respect of the Secured Obligations and the Secured Parties may at any time take,
give up, deal with, vary, exchange, or abstain from perfecting or enforcing any
other Security Interest without affecting or prejudicing the security hereby
created.

WARRANTY AND COVENANT

        prior written consent) create, agree to create or permit to subsist any
        Security Interest (however ranking in point of priority) of any nature
        whatsoever (including such as arises by operation of law or any
        enactment) in, over or affecting the Deposit or over its right to call
        for a discharge of the security hereby constituted nor deal with such
        right in any manner.

NON-DISPOSAL

(b)     The Chargor undertakes that it shall not (without the Security Trustee's
        prior written consent) transfer, assign, convey, declare a trust over or
        otherwise dispose of the Deposit or any part thereof or its right to
        repayment of the Deposit or any part thereof or its right to call for a
        discharge of the security hereby constituted nor deal with such right in
        any manner.

WAIVER AND APPROPRIATION

8.1   The Security Trustee may at any time after the security created hereunder
has become enforceable without further notice and without any right of
redemption appropriate the Deposit or any part thereof in such manner as the
Security Trustee may in its absolute discretion think fit in or towards the

8.2   If any appropriation of the Deposit (or any part thereof) takes place
hereunder the Chargor hereby expressly waives all or any formalities prescribed
by law in relation to any such appropriation.

INTEREST

9.    Interest on the Deposit shall accrue at such rates as may be agreed from
time to time between the Bank and the Chargor. Interest which has accrued on the
Deposit shall be credited to the Charged Account at such times as shall be
agreed by the parties.

FURTHER PROVISIONS

EXPENSES AND INDEMNITY:

10.1(a) The Chargor shall on demand pay to or reimburse the Security Trustee (on
        the basis of a full indemnity on an after tax basis) the amount of all
        commissions, reasonable costs (including legal costs), charges and
        expenses incurred by the Security Trustee in connection with the
        preservation, enforcement or the attempted preservation or enforcement
        of any of the Secured Parties' rights under this Deed whether incurred
        as a result of any act or omission by, or proceedings involving, the
        Chargor.

(b)     The Chargor shall on demand fully indemnify the Security Trustee (on an
        after-tax basis) against all losses, actions, claims, reasonable costs
        (including legal costs),


                                                                         Page 88
<PAGE>

      expenses, proceedings, liabilities and expenditure which the Security
      Trustee may suffer, pay or incur in connection with any payment or
      discharge in respect of the Secured Obligations (and which are made by the
      Chargor) being impeached or declared void for any reason whatsoever.

(c)   Where, pursuant to clauses 10.1(a) or (b) above, a sum is paid to the
      Security Trustee the Chargor shall, in addition, pay to the Security
      Trustee in respect of value added tax:

        (i) (except where the payment falls within (ii) below), such amount as
            equals any valued added tax charged to the Security Trustee in
            respect of the matter which gives rise to the payment and which the
            Security Trustee certifies is not recoverable by it by repayment or
            credit (such certificate to be conclusive in the absence of manifest
            error); and

       (ii) on any reimbursement of or indemnification for any commissions,
            costs, charges, expenses or other items incurred by the Security
            Trustee as agent for the Chargor, such amount as equals the amount
            included in the commissions, costs, charges, expenses or other items
            in respect of value added tax (and in such a case the Security
            Trustee shall provide the Chargor with an appropriate tax invoice in
            respect of such item, naming the Chargor as recipient of the
            relevant supply).

FURTHER ASSURANCES

10.2  The Chargor shall on demand execute any document and do any other act or
thing (in either case at the expense of the Chargor) which the Security Trustee
may reasonably specify for protecting, preserving or perfecting any security
created or intended to be created by this Deed or for facilitating the
realisation thereof or otherwise enforcing the same or exercising any of the
powers, rights and discretions of the Security Trustee under this Deed,
including the execution of all releases, transfers, assignments and other
documents and the giving of all notices, orders, instructions and directions
which the Security Trustee may request.

RIGHTS CUMULATIVE

10.3  The rights and powers which this Deed confers on the Secured Parties are
cumulative, may be exercised as often as it considers appropriate and are in
addition to its rights and powers under the general law, and the rights of the
Secured Parties (whether arising under this Deed or under the general law) shall
not be capable of being waived or varied otherwise than by express waiver or
variation in writing; and, in particular, any failure to exercise or any delay
in exercising any such rights shall not operate as a variation or waiver of that
or any other such right; any defective or partial exercise of such right shall
not preclude any other or further exercise of that or any other such right; and
no act or course of conduct or negotiation on their part or on their behalf
shall in any way preclude them from exercising any such right or constitute a
suspension or variation of any such right.

ILLEGALITY, ETC

10.4  If any one of the provisions of this Deed is or becomes invalid, illegal
or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality or enforceability of the
remaining provisions of this Deed shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby.


                                                                         Page 89
<PAGE>

DUTY TO ACCOUNT

and the Chargor, the Security Trustee shall not, prior to discharging the
security hereby constituted, have any duty to account to the Chargor in respect
of the Deposit or any part thereof.

EVIDENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

10.6  In any proceedings relating to this Deed, any determination or
notification by the Security Trustee or any other Finance Party as to any amount
of the Secured Obligations or as to any amount due to the Secured Parties under
this Deed shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive evidence as to
that matter.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT

this Deed.

RULING OFF

10.9  If the Security Trustee receives notice of any subsequent Security
Interest affecting the Deposit:

(a)   the Security Trustee may open a new account or accounts with the Chargor
      and if the Security Trustee does not open a new account, it shall
      nevertheless be treated as if it had done so at the time when it received
      notice; and

(b)   all payments made by the Chargor to the Security Trustee after the
      Security Trustee receives such notice shall be credited or be treated as
      having been credited to the new account and in no circumstances whatsoever
      shall operate to reduce the amount due from the Chargor to the Secured
      Parties at the time when it received the notice.

SUCCESSORS IN TITLE

10.10(a) This Deed shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the
         parties hereto and their successors and assigns.

         rights, benefits or obligations hereunder without the prior written
         consent of the Security Trustee.

         rights, benefits or obligations under this Deed to any person to whom
         it assigns and/or transfers its rights, benefits or obligations in
         accordance with the provisions of the Facility Agreement. Where the
         Security Trustee assigns or transfers its obligations or any part
         thereof, the Chargor shall execute such documents as the Security
         Trustee may specify to release the Security Trustee to the extent of
         the transfer or with a view to perfecting such document or transfer, or
         where necessary, shall execute further security documentation in favour
         of the assignee or transferee in like form to this Deed.


                                                                         Page 90
