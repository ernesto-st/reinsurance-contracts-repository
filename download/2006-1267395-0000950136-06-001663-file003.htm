Executive was employed with prior employers, the Executive may have
been exposed to confidential, proprietary and/or trade secret
information (&lsquo;&lsquo;Other Confidential
Information&rsquo;&rsquo;). the Employer also recognizes that the
Executive has a legal duty, and may have a contractual duty, not to use
or disclose Other Confidential Information outside of the
Executive&rsquo;s employment with such former employers. The Employer
has no intention to obtain any such information in any form and wishes
to ensure that the Executive is not placed in a position which might
cause the disclosure or use of any such information either
intentionally or inadvertently. If the Executive is ever involved in
any job situation which the Executive believes might cause the
disclosure or use of any such Other Confidential Information, the
Executive agrees to immediately notify the CEO and advise him of the
Executive&rsquo;s concerns. In the event it is determined that a risk
of disclosure or use does exist, the Employer will take appropriate
measures.</p>
