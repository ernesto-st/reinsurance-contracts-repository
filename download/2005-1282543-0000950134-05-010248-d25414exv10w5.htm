59.5%, then the Adjusted Ceding Commission for the underwriting year under consideration shall be
21.0%, plus 100% of the difference in percentage points between 73.5% and the actual ratio of
losses incurred to net earned premium;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">c. If the ratio of losses incurred to net earned premium is 59.5% or less, then the Adjusted Ceding

thereafter until all losses for the Policies in the First Underwriting Year have been finally
settled, the Managing General Agent shall calculate and report the Adjusted Ceding Commission on
net earned premium for the First Underwriting Year, subject to the following:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">a. With respect to the first and second calculation, if the Adjusted Ceding Commission on net

difference to the Managing General Agent as promptly as possible after receipt and verification of
the Managing General Agent&#146;s report.

net earned premium is less than the Provisional Ceding Commission previously allowed by the
Reinsurer on net earned premium for the underwriting year, the Managing General Agent shall remit
the difference to the Reinsurer with its report as promptly as possible after receipt and
verification of the Managing General Agent&#146;s report. If the Adjusted Ceding Commission on net
earned premium is greater than the Provisional Ceding Commission previously allowed by the
Reinsurer on net earned premium for the underwriting year, the Reinsurer shall remit the difference
to the Managing General Agent as promptly as possible after receipt and verification of the
Managing General Agent&#146;s report, but in any event no more than 30&nbsp;days following receipt and
acceptance of the report.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">c. Each underwriting year subsequent to the First Underwriting Year shall undergo the adjustment
described above.
