                            Dated as of July 31, 2001


     JORDAN  LAKE  PRESERVE  CORPORATION,  a  North  Carolina  corporation  (the
"Borrower"),  and INDYMAC BANK, F.S.B. dba CONSTRUCTION  LENDING  CORPORATION OF
AMERICA (the "Lender"), agree as follows:

     1.00 Preliminary Statement. The Borrower owns the Land described in Exhibit
"A",  which  consists  of  approximately  597 acres,  and intends to develop and
improve the Land in  accordance  with the  Improvement  Plans  submitted  by the
Borrower to the Lender. In conjunction with the completion of such Improvements,
the  Borrower  intends  that the Land will be  developed  as 515 Lots in two (2)
phases, with at least 355 Lots in Phase I and at least 160 Lots in Phase II. The
development  of the Land and the Project  commenced  prior to the closing of the
Loan, with certain of the Lots within Phase I having been previously conveyed to
third party purchasers. Therefore, due to such prior conveyances, the Land shall
initially  include (i) the 170 Lots in Phase I of the Project which  continue to
be owned by Borrower;  and, (ii) all of the Land which shall constitute Phase II
of the  Project and the golf course and related  amenities  being  developed  by
Borrower  as a part of the  Project.  In  order  to  finance  the  Land  and the
construction of the  Improvements  and the payment of various costs and expenses
relating to the Project,  the Borrower has applied to the Lender for a revolving
line of credit Loan in the amount of up to $6,700,000.00, the repayment of which
will be secured by the Borrower's  interest in the Land and the Improvements and
the other Collateral covered by the Deed of Trust to be executed by the Borrower
in favor of the Lender.  The Lender is willing to make the Loan to the  Borrower
on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     1.01 Type of Loan.  The Loan is structured as a revolving line of credit of
up to  $6,700,000.00.  Subject  to  compliance  by  Borrower  with  the  funding
requirements expressly set forth in this Agreement,  Borrower may repay the Loan
or  portions  thereof  and then  reborrow  from time to time  under such line of
credit hereby


                                      E-1
<PAGE>


established up to the maximum amount of  $6,700,000.00  which may be outstanding
at any one time; provided, however, notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to
the contrary,  the maximum amount which may be outstanding under the Loan at any
one time shall not exceed  the lesser of (i) fifty  percent  (50%) of the retail
value of Lots owned by Borrower  under  development or completed at any one time
as  determined by an appraiser  acceptable to Lender,  (ii) seventy five percent
(75%) of the "Discounted  Appraised  Value" of such Lots owned by Borrower under
development  or  completed  at  any  one  time  as  determined  by an  appraiser
acceptable  to Lender or, (iii)  seventy  five percent  (75%) of the total costs
incurred by Borrower pursuant to the Project Budget. As used herein  "Discounted
Appraised  Value" means the estimated  amount a single investor would be willing
to pay for all of such Lots owned by Borrower under  development or completed at
any one time upon the full development of such Lots when purchasing such Lots in
bulk;  that is, all at one time.  Subject to the foregoing  maximum amount which
may be outstanding under the Loan at any one time and compliance with all of the
other  terms and  provisions  of this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents,
Lender has committed the sum under the Loan as shown in the Project  Budget,  as
the same may be  modified  from time to time,  over the two (2) year term of the
Loan,  provided  the second  installment  of the Loan Fee is timely  received by
Lender as necessary to extend the initial one (1) year term of the Loan.

     Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined are used
with the meanings set forth in Exhibit "F".

     2.00 Documentation.  Prior to the first Disbursement of the proceeds of the
Loan  requested  by the  Borrower,  the  Borrower  shall  deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Lender, in form and substance  satisfactory to the Lender,  the
Loan Documents and other  "Required  Items"  specified in Exhibit "C",  together
with such other  Documents  and  information  relating  to any Loan  Party,  the
Collateral,  the Project or the transactions  contemplated by the Loan Documents
as the Lender may reasonably request.

     3.00  Disbursements.  Subject to the terms,  conditions  and procedures set
forth in this Agreement and in the "Disbursement  Schedule"  attached as Exhibit
"B", the Lender shall make  Disbursements  to or for the account of the Borrower
from time to time from the date of this Agreement to the Banking Day immediately
preceding the Maturity Date. The aggregate amount of all  Disbursements  made by
the Lender  shall not exceed the amount  committed  by Lender  under the Loan as
shown in the Project Budget, as the same may be modified from time to time, plus
the amount of any "Borrower's  Funds"  deposited with the Lender pursuant to the
Disbursement  Schedule.  All  Disbursements of the proceeds of the Loan shall be
evidenced by and repayable in accordance with the terms of the Note.

     4.00  Covenants of the Borrower.  Unless the Lender  otherwise  consents in
writing:

Borrower shall cause the construction  thereof to be diligently and continuously
prosecuted to  completion,  subject in each case to the following  requirements:

Improvement Plans and in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws and  Other  Requirements,  and in a good and  workmanlike  manner  with new
materials  of  good  quality;  (b)  except  as  otherwise  contemplated  by  the

residential building lots which constitute a Competing Project.

     If at any time the Lender  notifies the Borrower that  construction  of the
Improvements  does not conform to the  requirements  of this Section 4.01 or any
such nonconformity is otherwise  discovered by the Borrower,  the Borrower shall
immediately  cause  such  nonconforming  construction  to  be  stopped  and  all
necessary  corrective  work to be  commenced  and  diligently  and  continuously
prosecuted to completion.

     4.02 Change  Orders.  The Borrower shall not permit any Change Order to the
Improvement  Plans to be  implemented  without the prior approval of the Lender,
provided  that  this  Section  4.02  shall  not  prevent   routine   changes  in

comply in all material respects with all applicable Laws and Other  Requirements

necessary or appropriate to maintain and enforce its rights and interests  under

relative to the development of the Project), (b) comply in all material respects
with its  obligations  under each of the Project  Agreements,  (c) not permit or

Agreements, and (d) not transfer, encumber or release any interest in, or commit
or permit any material breach or default on the part of the Borrower under,  any
of the  Project  Agreements,  except  that so long as no  Event of  Default  has
occurred and is continuing, this Section 4.04 shall not apply to (i) any failure
of the Borrower to comply with such  requirements  which in the  aggregate  does
not,  and in the  reasonable  judgment of the  Borrower and the Lender will not,
materially  impair the Borrower's  ability to perform its Obligations  under the
Loan Documents,  (ii) any amendment of the Engineer Agreement,  the Construction
Contract,  if any, and any other contract  entered into


                                      E-3
<PAGE>


by Borrower relative to the development of the Project to incorporate any Change

with  possession  of or  abandon  any of the  Collateral  or cause or permit any
interest in any of the Collateral to be sold, transferred,  leased,  encumbered,
released,  relinquished  or  otherwise  disposed  of  (whether  voluntarily,  by
operation  of law or  otherwise),  provided  that:  (a) so long as no  Event  of
Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing  and  receipt  by the  Lender  of the

the Lender  shall  release Lots and common areas or interests in common areas so
sold or  transferred  from the Lien of the Deed of Trust and (iii) the  Borrower
may, in the ordinary course of business, receive, hold and dispose of any excess
proceeds  resulting  from the sale of any Lot after  payment  of the  applicable
"Release  Price";  and (b) the  requirements of this sentence shall not prohibit
(1)  the  creation  or  existence  of  any  Permitted  Exceptions  or  Permitted
Transfers,  or (2) any action  with  respect to any  Project  Agreements  to the
extent  permitted  by  Section  4.04.  Releases  hereunder  by  Lender  shall be

to the principal of the Note, provided that if such amount exceeds the principal
of the Note then  outstanding,  the excess shall be held by the Lender in a Cash
Collateral  Account and thereafter applied by the Lender (A) so long as no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, to future advances of principal under
the Note as and when made,  or (B) if an Event of Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  to any Obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents at such
time or times and in such manner as the Lender deems  appropriate.  Upon payment
in full of all Obligations of the Borrower and termination of all obligations of
the Lender under the Loan  Documents,  the Lender shall  release its interest in
any amounts then held in any such Cash Collateral Account.

clear of all Liens  (including  conditional sale contracts) and Rights of Others
(other than Permitted  Exceptions) or which is not a part of the Collateral,  or
(b) cause or  permit  the  removal  from the Land  (or,  in the case of  offsite
improvements,  from the location of installation) of any Personal Property which

occurred and is continuing, this clause (b) shall not prohibit (i) the temporary
removal of Personal  Property  for repairs in the  ordinary  course of business,
(ii) the  removal of  Personal  Property  of  insignificant  value  which is not
reasonably  necessary or appropriate to the completion of the Project,  or (iii)
the removal of  defective  Personal  Property  which has been  replaced by other
Personal  Property of equal or greater  suitability  and value which is intended
for the same purpose.  Upon removal of any Personal  Property in compliance with
clauses  (ii) and (iii) above,  the  Borrower  shall be permitted to transfer or
otherwise dispose of such Personal Property as the Borrower may determine.

     4.07 Liens and Taxes. The Borrower shall (a) pay, prior to delinquency, all
Taxes which are or may become a Lien  affecting any of the  Collateral,  and not
consent to any Special  Taxes which affect or may affect any of the  Collateral,

lien releases or waivers  (together  with invoices or receipts  identifying  the
nature of each payment) from, all Lien  Claimants,  (d) take all other necessary
steps to forestall  the  assertion of Lien Claims,  and (e) pay and perform when
due all other obligations secured by or constituting a Lien affecting any of the
Collateral, except that the Borrower shall not be required to pay or perform any
such Taxes, Lien Claims or other obligations which are being actively  contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings,  provided that the Borrower has posted
such security for the payment or performance of such Taxes, Lien Claims or other
obligations as the Lender may  reasonably  require and, by reason of nonpayment,
none of the  Collateral  or any Lien or other  interest of the Lender  under the
Loan Documents is prejudiced or in danger of being sold, foreclosed or otherwise
lost or forfeited.

     In the event that any action or other  proceeding  is instituted to enforce
any Lien (including any mechanics lien, and whether or not such Lien constitutes
a  Permitted  Exception)  against  any of the  Collateral,  the  Borrower  shall
immediately make such payments,  obtain such surety bonds and/or take such other
action as the Lender may reasonably  require in order to release the stop notice
or Lien. Upon failure of the Borrower to take any of the foregoing  actions in a
timely manner,  the Lender may, at its option,  file an  interpleader  action to
resolve any pending claims.

     The  Borrower  irrevocably  appoints  the Lender as its agent (such  agency
being  coupled  with an  interest)  to file any  notices  that the Lender  deems
appropriate in order to protect its interests under the Loan Documents.

expenses and charges of the Lender in  connection  with the approval of the Loan
by  the  Lender  and  the   negotiation,   preparation,   execution,   delivery,
administration,  supplement, modification, amendment, waiver and enforcement of,
and any other  action  taken by the Lender  under or  otherwise  to protect  its
rights and  interests  in respect  of, any Loan  Document,  and any  litigation,
dispute,  action or other proceeding (including bankruptcy proceedings) relating
thereto,  including recording fees, filing fees, search fees, reconveyance fees,
title  insurance  premiums,  appraisal,  engineering,  inspection and consulting
fees, the reasonable  fees and  disbursements  of the Lender's legal counsel and
other  out-of-pocket  expenses,  and any fees or other charges of the Lender for
appraisals  or  inspections  or for  review of  appraisals,  budgets,  plans and
specifications or other matters relating to the Project or the Collateral.

     Any amount payable to the Lender under any of the Loan Documents (including
any amount  payable  under this Section 4.12) which is not paid on the date when
due shall,  from and after such date,  bear interest at the Alternate Rate until
paid.  Such interest shall be payable by the Borrower to the Lender  immediately
and without demand.

     4.13 Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify,  defend
and save and hold harmless the Lender and its subsidiaries  and affiliates,  and
the  respective  directors,  officers,  agents,  attorneys and employees of each
(collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against,  and shall pay on demand, any
and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, expenses and charges (including the
reasonable fees,  charges and  disbursements of external legal counsel) suffered
or incurred by any  Indemnitee as a result of (a) any failure of the Borrower to
perform any of its Obligations  under any Loan Document,  (b) any failure of any
Representation  by the  Borrower to be correct in all  respects  when made,  (c)
injury or death to persons or


                                      E-9
<PAGE>


damage  to  property  or  other  loss  occurring  on or in  connection  with the
Collateral or the Project,  whether caused by the negligence or any other act or
omission  of the  Borrower  or any  Lien  Claimant  or any  other  Person  or by
negligent,  faulty,  inadequate or defective design,  building,  construction or
maintenance or any other condition or otherwise,  (d) any claim of any surety in
connection with any bond relating to construction of any Improvements or offsite
improvements,  and (e) any claim,  demand or cause of  action,  or any action or
other  proceeding,  whether  meritorious or not, brought or asserted against any
Indemnitee  which relates to or arises out of the Loan Documents,  the Loan, the
Collateral,  the Project or any transaction contemplated by, or the relationship
between  the  Borrower  and the Lender or any action or  inaction  by the Lender
under,  the Loan  Documents,  provided that no  Indemnitee  shall be entitled to
indemnification  under  this  Section  4.13 for  matters  caused  solely by such
Indemnitee's  gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct.  Any  obligation of the
Borrower  under this Section 4.13 shall  survive the making and repayment of the
Loan and the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall be secured by
the Deed of Trust.

     4.14  Actions and Further  Assurances.  The  Borrower  shall  appear in and
defend  all  actions  and other  proceedings  purporting  to  affect  any of the
Collateral  or the Project or the rights or  interests  of the Lender  under the
Loan  Documents (and the Lender may, at the  Borrower's  expense,  appear in and
defend any such action or other proceeding as the Lender may determine), and the
Borrower  shall take or cause to be taken such  further  action and  execute and
deliver or cause to be executed  and  delivered  such  further  Documents as the
Lender from time to time may reasonably require to maintain,  perfect,  protect,
assure and confirm  the  Lender's  rights and  interests  (including  rights and
interests in the  Collateral),  the Borrower's  Obligations and the intention of
the parties under the Loan Documents.

     4.15 Performance by the Lender. If the Borrower fails to perform any of its
Obligations  under any Loan Document and the Lender  reasonably  determines that
remedial  action is  necessary to protect the rights or interests of the Lender,
the Lender may,  without  notice to or demand on the Borrower,  perform any such
Obligations  in such manner and to such extent and take such other action as the
Lender may deem appropriate,  and all costs,  expenses and charges of the Lender
relating  to any such action  shall be payable by the  Borrower to the Lender in
accordance with Section 4.12.

     5.00 Representations of the Borrower.  The Borrower represents and warrants
to the Lender that:

     5.01 Formation and Qualification. Each Loan Party which is a corporation is
duly  incorporated,  validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and is duly qualified in North Carolina;  each
Loan Party  which is a  partnership,  trust or other  entity is duly  formed and
validly existing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and, in the
case of a limited partnership formed under the Laws of a jurisdiction other than
California,  is duly  registered in North  Carolina;  each Loan Party which is a
corporation or limited  partnership is in good standing in North Carolina;  each
Loan Party  which is a limited


                                      E-10
<PAGE>


liability company is in good standing in North Carolina; and each Loan Party has
all  requisite  power and authority to conduct its business and to own, sell and
lease its properties.

     5.02 Loan  Documents.  The execution,  delivery and performance of the Loan
Documents by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's  power and  authority,
have been duly  authorized by all  necessary  action and do not and will not (a)
require  any  Authorization  which has not been  obtained  (except to the extent
indicated  in  Section  5.05(b)  with  respect  to  Authorizations  required  in
connection  with the  Collateral or the  Project),  (b)  contravene  the Charter
Documents of any Loan Party,  any applicable  Laws or Other  Requirements or any
agreement or restriction binding on or affecting any Loan Party or its property,
or (c) result in or require the creation or  imposition  of any Lien or Right of
Others upon or with  respect to any  property  now or in the future owned by any
Loan Party (other than Liens in favor of the Lender). No Authorization which has
not been  obtained is required for the creation of the Liens or the  enforcement
by the Lender of its Remedies under the Loan Documents. Each Loan Document, when
executed and delivered,  will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
of each  Loan  Party  which  is a party  to or  bound  by  such  Loan  Document,
enforceable  against  such Loan Party in  accordance  with its terms,  except as
enforcement  may be limited by  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or other  similar  Laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally.

     5.03 Finder's or Broker's Fees. Except as otherwise  disclosed in Part B of
Exhibit  "C":  (a) no  finder's  or  broker's  fee is  payable  to any Person in
connection  with the Loan, and (b) the payment of any such fee disclosed in Part
B of Exhibit "C" is the sole  responsibility  of the  Borrower  and such fee has
been (or  upon  recordation  of the  Deed of Trust  will be) paid in full by the
Borrower. The Borrower hereby indemnifies and holds harmless the Lender from any
claims, liability,  damages, costs or expenses (including without limitation the
fees and expenses of legal counsel)  resulting from or arising out of any claims
or assertions by any Person  (including  without  limitation any broker,  agent,
financial advisor or other  intermediary) for any finder's broker's or other fee
or compensation  of any kind in connection  with the Loan. Such  indemnification
obligation  of the part of the Borrower  shall survive  termination  of the Loan
Documents.

     5.04  Collateral.  The  Borrower  has and  will  continue  to have (or upon
recordation  of the Deed of Trust will have and from and after such  recordation
will continue to have) good and  marketable  title to the  Collateral,  free and
clear of all Liens and Rights of Others,  subject only to  Permitted  Exceptions
and Permitted  Transfers of Personal  Property.  Upon recordation of the Deed of
Trust and filing of the financing  statement executed by the Borrower,  the Deed
of Trust will create a valid and indefeasible  first priority  perfected Lien in
the Collateral securing the payment and performance of all Obligations,  subject
only to Permitted Prior Exceptions and Permitted Transfers of Personal Property.
No financing statements covering any of the Collateral are on file in any public
office,  except  financing  statements  in favor  of the  Lender  and any  other
financing statements approved by the Lender in writing.

of construction by any Governmental Agency which (in each case) are to be issued
on a  ministerial  basis as  required  from time to time  during  the  course of
construction and after completion), and (ii) the development and use of the Real
Property  for its intended  purpose do not require the payment of  extraordinary

other  legal,  contractual  or practicle  impediments  which are material in the
aggregate.  (c) The  Project  Budget and any Line Item Budget  delivered  to the
Lender are based on  information  deemed  reliable by the Borrower and represent
the  Borrower's  best  estimate  of all  Project  Costs that will be required in
connection  with the Project,  and all Project Costs shown in the Project Budget
or any such Line Item Budget as "Previously  Paid By Borrower" have been paid in
full. (d) All Utility Services,  streets and other offsite improvements relating
to or adjoining  the Land or necessary for the ultimate  development  and use of
the  Real  Property  for its  intended  purpose  have  been or will be  promptly
completed  and/or otherwise made available at no further expense to the Borrower
(except for costs  relating  to such work  reflected  in the Project  Budget for

restrictions  which may  adversely  affect the  Collateral or the Project in any
material respect. (e) The approximate acreage of the Land is correctly set forth

the  Land and  each  Lot or  parcel  described  in  Exhibit  "A" are  separately
transferable  in  compliance  with all  applicable  subdivision  Laws and  Other
Requirements.  (f) Except as otherwise  disclosed in writing to the Lender,  the
Engineer Agreement,  the Construction  Contract,  if any, and any other contract
entered into by Borrower  relative to the development of the Project are in full
force and effect and free from any material breach or default by any party.

     5.06 Financial Information. (a) The Financial Statements of each Loan Party
which  have been  furnished  to the  Lender  fairly  present  such Loan  Party's
financial condition as at the dates of such Financial Statements and the results
of operations for the periods covered by such Financial Statements in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied (or such
other method of  preparation  approved by the Lender in writing),  and since the
respective  dates of such  Financial  Statements,  there  has  been no  material


                                      E-12
<PAGE>


adverse change in the financial condition,  operations,  properties or prospects
of such Loan Parties.  (b) Each Loan Party has filed all tax returns required to
be filed by it,  and has paid all  Taxes  due  pursuant  to such  returns  or in
respect of any of its  properties  (except  for any such  Taxes  which are being
actively  contested in good faith by appropriate  proceedings),  and to the best
knowledge of each Loan Party, no basis exists for additional  assessments  which
have not been adequately  reserved against in the Financial  Statements referred
to above or  otherwise  disclosed  in writing to the Lender.  For so long as the
Loan or any part thereof shall remain outstanding, Borrower and all Loan Parties
shall  submit  such  financial  information  to Lender as  Lender  may  request,
including,  but not limited to, the  financial  information  required by Section
4.11.

     5.07 Litigation and Other Matters. Except as otherwise disclosed in writing
to the Lender: (a) no actions or other proceedings  affecting or relating to the
Collateral  or the Project are  pending or, to the best  knowledge  of each Loan
Party,  threatened,  (b) no actions or other  proceedings are pending or, to the
best  knowledge of each Loan Party,  threatened  against or  affecting  any Loan
Party or any property of any Loan Party which,  if determined  adversely to such

properties  or prospects of such Loan Party or the ability of such Loan Party to
perform its obligations under the Loan Documents, and (c) the Borrower has given
notice to the Lender of any other  matters  which the  Borrower  is  required to
disclose to the Lender under Section 4.11(a).

create,  arrange,  develop,  purchase  or sell  any  single  family  residential
building lots which constitute a Competing Project.

     5.10  Compliance  with Laws.  Without in any way limiting any of Borrower's
other  representations,  warranties  or covenants  contained in this  Agreement,
Borrower hereby  represents,  warrants and covenants that the Improvement  Plans
are, and the  construction  of the  Improvements  according  thereto will be, in
compliance  with  all  applicable   federal,   state  and  local  laws,   rules,
regulations,  ordinances and codes,  including without  limitation the Americans
with  Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.  12101, et. seq., as amended,  and the

     prospects of any Loan Party,  or any event shall occur which has a material
     adverse impact on the Collateral or the Project.

     6.02 Remedies of the Lender.  Upon the  occurrence of any Event of Default,
the  Lender  may,  without  notice to or  demand  upon the  Borrower,  which are
expressly  waived by the  Borrower  (except  for  notices or  demands  otherwise
required by applicable Laws to the extent not effectively waived by the Borrower
and any notices or demands specified in the Loan Documents), exercise any one or
more of the following Remedies as the Lender may determine:

          (a) the Lender may, at its option,  terminate all  commitments to make
     Disbursements,  or the Lender may waive the Event of  Default  or,  without
     waiving,  determine,  upon terms and conditions satisfactory to the Lender,
     to make further Disbursements;

          (b) the Lender may  declare the unpaid  principal  of the Note and all
     accrued  interest and other amounts  payable under the Loan Documents to be
     immediately  due and  payable,  in  which  event  all  such  amounts  shall
     immediately  be due and payable  without  protest,  presentment,  notice of
     dishonor,  demand or further notice of any kind, all of which are expressly
     waived by the Borrower;

          (c) the Lender may perform any of the  Borrower's  Obligations in such
     manner as the Lender may determine;

          (d)  the  Lender  may,   either   directly  or  through  an  agent  or
     court-appointed  receiver, take possession of the Collateral and enter into
     such  contracts and take such other action as the Lender deems  appropriate
     to complete or  partially  construct  all or any part of the  Improvements,
     subject to such  modifications  and  changes in the  Project or the plan of
     development as the Lender may deem appropriate; and

          (e) the Lender may  proceed to protect,  exercise  and enforce any and
     all other Remedies provided under the Loan Documents or by applicable Laws.


     All costs,  expenses,  charges and advances of the Lender in exercising any
such Remedies  (including  any such amounts which cause the  obligations  of the
Borrower to exceed the face amount of the Note) shall be payable by the Borrower
to the Lender in accordance with Section 4.12.

     Each of the  Remedies  of the  Lender  provided  in the Loan  Documents  is
cumulative  and not  exclusive  of, and shall not  prejudice,  any other  Remedy
provided  in the Loan  Documents  or by  applicable  Laws.  Each


                                      E-16
<PAGE>


Remedy may be  exercised  from time to time as often as deemed  necessary by the
Lender, and in such order and manner as the Lender may determine.  No failure or
delay on the part of the  Lender in  exercising  any Remedy  shall  operate as a
waiver of such  Remedy;  nor shall any single or partial  exercise of any Remedy
preclude any other or further exercise of such Remedy or of any other Remedy. No
application  of payments,  or any  advances or other action by the Lender,  will
cure or waive  any  Event of  Default  or  prevent  acceleration,  or  continued
acceleration,  of  amounts  payable  under the Loan  Documents  or  prevent  the
exercise, or continued exercise, of any Remedies of the Lender.

     7.00 Miscellaneous.

     7.01 Waivers and  Amendments.  No supplement to,  modification or amendment
of, or waiver,  consent or approval  under,  any of the Loan Documents  shall be
effective unless in writing and signed by the Lender, and any waiver, consent or
approval shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the specific
purpose for which given.

     7.02 Survival of  Representations.  All  Representations  shall survive the
making and  repayment  of the Loan and the  expiration  or  termination  of this
Agreement  and have been or will be relied upon by the  Lender,  notwithstanding
any investigation made by the Lender or on its behalf.

     7.03 Notices. All notices and other communications  provided under any Loan
Document  shall  be in  writing  and  mailed  or  personally  delivered  to  the
appropriate  party  at the  address  set  forth  on the  signature  page of this
Agreement or any other Loan  Document or, as to any party,  at any other address
in the State of California as shall be designated by it in a written notice sent
to the other party. All notices and other  communications  by the Borrower which
are  expressly  subject to  receipt  by the  Lender  under the terms of the Loan
Documents will be effective when received by an officer or other  representative
of the Lender having direct  responsibility  for  administration of the Loan. In
all other cases,  any notice or other  communication  will be  effective  (a) if
given by mail,  on the earlier of receipt or the third day after  deposit in the
United  States  mails  with  first-class  postage  prepaid,  or (b) if  given by
personal  delivery,  when  delivered,  provided  that the  requirements  of this
sentence  shall not  impair or delay the  effectiveness  of any  notice or other
communication  given by the  Lender  under  the Deed of Trust or any  Additional
Collateral  Agreements  when  such  notice  or other  communication  is given in
compliance with and would otherwise be effective under applicable Laws.

     7.04 Relationship of Parties. The relationship between the Borrower and the
Lender is, and at all times shall  remain,  solely that of debtor and  creditor,
and  shall not be,  or be  construed  to be, a joint  venture,  equity  venture,
partnership or other relationship of any nature.

     7.05 Nonliability of the Lender. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that:


                                      E-17
<PAGE>
