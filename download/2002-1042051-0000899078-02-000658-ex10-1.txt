         NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the preliminary statements and the
mutual agreements,  covenants,  representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement and for other good, valid and binding  consideration,  the receipt and

Section 1.1        Terms and Conditions; Service Addendum.

         (a) General Applicability of this Agreement.  This Agreement sets forth
the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to each  Service  Addendum.  A  Party's

acknowledgement  and  acceptance of the terms and  conditions  set forth in this
Agreement  and (ii)  execution  and  delivery of this  Agreement.  If a conflict
exists  between  the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement  and any  Service
Addendum,  then the terms and conditions set forth in such Service Addendum will
prevail.

         (b) Service  Addendum.  Each Service  Addendum will be in substantially

consideration  of the Addendum  Services (the "Addendum  Service Fees") and (vi)

the Designated Representative with written notice of Customer's option to assume

all further  responsibility  for the  administration  of the  disputed  claim or
feature;  and, in the event Customer  elects within ten (10) days to assume such

to Customer  such  disputed  claim or feature,  and,  will  promptly  deliver to
Customer  the  original  claim  file,   notes,   photographs   and  any  Special
Investigation  Unit  files,  which  material  will be returned to INSpire at the
conclusion of the arbitration or litigation. Notwithstanding Customer's election
with respect to the Party  responsible  for the  administration  of any disputed
claim or feature,  Customer  will be  responsible  for all  expenses,  including
attorneys'  fees,  incurred after receipt by INSpire of a demand for arbitration
or after receipt by INSpire of notice that litigation has been filed  concerning
a claim or feature; and

Addendum will have Positive Pay  established  on the Addendum  Effective Date of
such Service Addendum.

Section 1.2 Engagement to Provide the Addendum  Services.  Each Customer engages
INSpire to provide the Addendum  Services set forth in each Service  Addendum to

Agreement.

Section 1.3  Exclusivity  of the Addendum  Services.  During each Addendum Term,
INSpire  will be the sole and  exclusive  provider of the  Addendum  Services to
Customer (other than Customer's  rendering an incidental  amount of the Addendum
Services  on its own  behalf,  which  will not in any way  affect  the amount of
Addendum  Service  Fees  due to  INSpire).  In  furtherance  of the  immediately
preceding  sentence,  Customer  acknowledges  that during each Addendum Term (a)
INSpire will have the sole and exclusive right to provide the Addendum  Services
to  Customer,  (b)  Customer  will not use or engage any other  person or entity
(including  Customer  or an  Affiliate  of  Customer)  to  render  the  Addendum
Services,  (c) Customer will not take any actions or do any things the intent or
effect of which is to  circumvent  or affect  adversely  the  provisions of this

                                       7
<PAGE>

         (a) Monthly Addendum Service Fees. During each Addendum Term,  Customer
will pay to INSpire for the  performance  of the  Addendum  Services the monthly
Addendum  Service Fees set forth on the applicable  Service  Addendum.  Customer
will pay to INSpire  the  Addendum  Service  Fees  within 15 days of  Customer's
receipt of INSpire's  invoice for the  Addendum  Services  performed  during the
previous  calendar month.  Customer's  payment of the Addendum Service Fees will
not be deemed to be Customer's acceptance regarding the amount or calculation of
such Addendum  Service Fees,  and each Party agrees to resolve in good faith any
dispute regarding the amount or calculation of Addendum Service Fees.

         (b) Negotiated  Adjustment of Addendum  Service Fees. Each Party agrees
to negotiate in good faith for an adjustment to the Addendum Service Fees in the
event (i) of any statutory,  regulatory or judicial change or other circumstance
not within  the  control of any Party  that  results in a material  increase  or
decrease in the  Addendum  Services to be  provided  pursuant to the  applicable
Service Addendum or (ii) the Parties agree to a material increase or decrease in
the  Addendum  Services  to be  provided  pursuant  to  the  applicable  Service
Addendum.

         (c)  Discount  of  Addendum  Services  Fees.  The amount of the monthly
Addendum  Service  Fees due and  payable  to INSpire  will be reduced  when such
monthly  Addendum  Service Fees reach certain  levels,  as set forth below.  The
Parties  agree that the  following  discounts  will be based on and apply to the
aggregate  monthly amount of Addendum Service Fees due to INSpire as a result of
performing the Addendum Services for all Service  Addendums  attached hereto. In
calculating the aggregate  monthly amount of Addendum  Service Fees, the service
fees paid to INSpire  pursuant to the  Millers  American  Group/INSpire  Service
Agreement  dated  September 1, 1999 will also be used to calculate  the discount
pursuant to this section.

         (d) Benchmark  Adjustment.  After the  completion of the fifth Contract
Year  of  each  Service  Addendum,  the  then-effective  Addendum  Service  Fees
applicable to such Service Addendum will be adjusted, if at all, through the use
of an independent third party benchmarking services.  Prior to the completion of
the fifth  Contract  Year of each Service  Addendum,  the Parties will  mutually
agree on the scope  of,  and the  methodology  to be used in,  the  benchmarking
process.  The fees and services  charged by the party  conducting  the benchmark
service will be borne  equally by the parties to such Service  Addendum.  If the
benchmark  process  demonstrates  that  the  quality  of the  Addendum  Services
received by Customer in  relation to the  Addendum  Service  Fees are not in the

                                       8
<PAGE>

upper half of the comparison group used in the benchmark  process,  then INSpire
will promptly adopt a plan  (including  corrective  action and/or a reduction in
the Addendum Service Fees) that will remedy any  deficiencies  identified in the
benchmark process.

         (e) Penalty/Award  Payments. From (i) the later to occur of an Addendum
Effective  Date or the  termination  of an  Addendum  Implementation  Period (if
applicable),  until (ii) the earlier of the termination of that Service Addendum
or its Addendum  Expiration  Date,  INSpire  will achieve each of those  service
levels set forth on Schedule 1.4(e) that are applicable to the Addendum Services
set forth on the applicable Service Addendum (the "Service Levels").  If INSpire
fails to achieve or exceeds the  Service  Levels  with the  frequency  or in the
manner set forth on Schedule  1.4(e),  then INSpire will be responsible  for the
penalty  payments,  or  entitled  to the  award  payments,  as the  case may be,
specified on Schedule  1.4(e).  After the Parties have  reviewed and agreed upon
the content of the  Monthly  Service  Report,  the  penalty  payments  and award
payments will be detailed on INSpire's  monthly invoice,  and will be subject to
the  same  payment  terms   specified  in  subsection  (a)  above.   Each  Party
acknowledges that the payments  specified on Schedule 1.4(e) will not subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.2(a).

         (f) Adjustment for Changes in the Consumer Price Index. For purposes of
calculating  the  Addendum  Services  Fees  payable with respect to each Service
Addendum,  all fixed dollar  amounts set forth in Paragraph 5 (or the applicable
Addendum  Service  Fee  paragraph  of such  Service  Addendum)  of each  Service
Addendum  will be subject to  increase  or  decrease  at the  beginning  of each
Contract Year equal to the  percentage  change in the Consumer  Price  Index-All
Urban User Fort Worth,  Texas) for the latest  twelve month period ending on the
date of each anniversary of the Addendum Effective Date.

Section 1.5 Taxes.  Customer will pay all tariffs and taxes,  however designated
or levied,  that are  applicable  to any Addendum  Services  and/or any Addendum
Service Fees. Such tariffs and taxes include state and local sales and use taxes
and any other  tariff or tax based on the  Addendum  Services  performed  or the
payment of the Addendum Service Fees.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Customer
will not be  responsible  for, and INSpire will pay (a) any  franchise or income
taxes based upon the income of INSpire and (b) any personal  property or similar
taxes based upon the personal or real property  owned or leased by INSpire.  All
Parties will take all reasonable  actions necessary to minimize and mitigate any
tariffs or taxes, however designated, that may be levied on or after the Signing
Date and will  confer  with the other  Party  prior to making  any  filing on or
behalf of such Party.

Section 1.6 Right of First Refusal for Additional Services.

         (a) Notice of Bid for Additional Services.  Subject to Section 1.3, if,
at any time and from time to time during an Addendum Term,  any Customer  elects
to solicit a bid from third parties (a "Bid") to perform any services similar to
the  Addendum  Services  set forth in the Services  Addendums  (such  additional
services, the "Additional Services"),  such Customer will provide to INSpire all
the information necessary for INSpire to submit a Bid on a timely basis for such
Additional Services.

                                       9
<PAGE>

         (b) Grant of Right of First Refusal. If such Customer decides to accept
any bona fide Bid other  than  INSpire's  Bid,  then,  prior to such  Customer's
acceptance  of such  competing  bona fide Bid,  such  Customer  will  provide to
INSpire written notice setting forth the terms of such competing Bid,  including
the price, service levels, technology to be employed and time table to implement
the  Additional  Services  (the  terms of such  competing  Bid,  the  "Competing
Terms").  At any time during the fifteen (15) day period  immediately  following
INSpire's receipt of the notice setting forth the Competing Terms,  INSpire will
have the exclusive  right,  but not the obligation,  to amend its Bid to meet or
exceed the Competing Terms (or terms as similar as reasonably possible).

         (c) Exercise of the Right of First  Refusal.  INSpire will exercise its
right  of  first  refusal  granted  pursuant  to this  Section,  if at  all,  by
delivering  written notice thereof  ("Exercise  Notice") to such Customer within
the fifteen (15) day period  specified  above.  If INSpire  timely  delivers the
Exercise  Notice,  then INSpire will implement the Additional  Services on terms
substantially the same as set forth in INSpire's amended Bid.

         (d) Failure to Deliver an Exercise  Notice.  If INSpire fails to timely
deliver the Exercise  Notice or, having timely  delivered such Exercise  Notice,
fails to implement the Additional  Services within the time period  specified in
INSpire's  amended  Bid,  then such  Customer,  at any time  within one  hundred
thirty-five (135) days after INSpire's failure to take such appropriate  action,
may accept the competing Bid on the Competing Terms. If Customer does not accept
the  competing Bid on the  Competing  Terms within such one hundred  thirty-five
(135) day period,  then such  Customer will again be required to comply with the
provisions of this Section.

determined  by any Party that a Party's  Systems,  the  Systems  that a Party is
providing  access to or use of in accordance  with this Agreement or any portion
thereof  are not  Year  2000  Compliant,  INSpire,  on the one  hand,  and  each
Customer,  on the other hand,  agrees to assist in any reasonable  manner and to

                                 CONFIDENTIALITY

Section 5.1 Nondisclosure. The Parties hereby agree as follows:

         (a)  Use of  Information.  All  Confidential  Information  will be used
solely for the purpose of  performing  the Addendum  Services.  In no event will
Confidential  Information be used by any party or person receiving  Confidential
Information for business or competitive purposes.

         (b) Confidentiality. All Confidential Information will be kept strictly
confidential  by the  Receiving  Party and the  Receiving  Party  will  restrict
disclosure  of  Confidential  Information  to only those  employees,  agents and
advisors of the Receiving Party who have a need to know such information for the
purpose of performing the Addendum Services.

         (c)  Disclosure to  Representatives.  Representatives  of the Receiving
Party will be informed by the Receiving Party of the confidential nature of such
information  and  the  covenant  of   confidentiality  by  the  Receiving  Party
hereunder,  and they  will be  directed  by the  receiving  Party to treat  such
information  confidentially.  Before  any  disclosure  or  dissemination  of any
Confidential  Information subject to this Agreement is made to any person, other
than an officer or director of the Receiving Party or its counsel or independent
accountants, the Receiving Party will provide the person to whom such disclosure
is made with a copy of this Agreement.

Section 5.2 No Solicitation or Hiring. During each Addendum Term and for the six
month period  immediately  following the Addendum  Expiration  Date,  each Party
agrees that,  without the effected Party's prior written  consent,  no Party nor
any of its Affiliates will solicit for employment,  employ or otherwise contract
for the  services  of any  person  who is or was  employed  by any other  Party,
provided that this Section will not apply to (a) general commercially  published
solicitations for employment by a Party or its Affiliates,  (b) the solicitation
or hiring of an employee  who was not an employee of any other Party at any time
during the six months immediately preceding such solicitation or hiring.

Section  5.3  Required  Disclosure.  In the  event  the  Receiving  Party or its
Representatives  are  requested  or required in a  judicial,  administrative  or
governmental proceeding to disclose any Confidential Information,  the Receiving
Party will cooperate with the Disclosing Party and provide it with prompt notice
of any  such  request  so that the  Disclosing  Party  may  seek an  appropriate
protective order or waive the Receiving  Party's  compliance with the provisions
of this Agreement.  If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party or its Representatives are nonetheless, in
the opinion of the Receiving  Party's  attorneys,  legally  required to disclose
Confidential  Information  to any  tribunal or else stand liable for contempt or
suffer other penalty,  the Receiving Party may disclose such information to such
tribunal without liability hereunder, provided that the Receiving Party complies
with the notice provisions of this paragraph.

         Section 5.4 Remedies for Breach. The Parties  acknowledge that a breach
of the covenant of  confidentiality  contained in this  Agreement will result in
irreparable and continuing  damage to the Disclosing  Party for which there will
be no adequate remedy at law. In the event of any breach of this Agreement,  the
Receiving  Party agrees that the  Disclosing  Party will be entitled to seek and
obtain specific performance of this Agreement by the Receiving Party, including,
upon  making the  requisite  showing  that it is entitled  thereto,  provisional
injunctive  relief  restraining the Receiving Party from committing such breach,
in addition to such other and further relief,  including  monetary  damages,  as
provided by law.

THIS AGREEMENT EXPIRES OR IS TERMINATED.

                                  ARTICLE VI.
                       TRADE SECRET AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

Section 6.1 No Rights to Software.  Notwithstanding INSpire's use of its Systems
in the  performance  of the Addendum  Services,  neither this  Agreement nor the
performance of any Addendum  Services  hereunder will be construed as a grant to
Customer of a license or any other interest in or to INSpire's Systems. Further,
this Agreement grants to Customer no right to possess or reproduce, or any other
interest in, any of INSpire's  software  used in the  performance  of all or any

Section 6.2  Nondisclosure.  Other than Customer's  employees who need access to
INSpire's  Systems for the performance of their duties,  Customer  covenants and
agrees not to use,  disclose or  otherwise  make  available to any person any of
INSpire's  Systems  used in the  performance  of all or any part of the Addendum
Services.  Customer  agrees to take all reasonable  steps  necessary to obligate
each of its  employees  who is given access to  INSpire's  Systems to a level of
care sufficient to protect such Systems from unauthorized use or disclosure.

CONTINUE AFTER THIS AGREEMENT EXPIRES OR IS TERMINATED.

                                   ARTICLE VII.
                                   TERMINATION

Section 7.1 Termination of Agreement.  This Agreement will be deemed  terminated
upon the  termination  or  expiration  of all Service  Addendums,  whether  such

<PAGE>

         (a) with  respect  to any  material  breach  of this  Agreement  or any
material breach of the applicable  Service Addendum,  by written notice from the
non-breaching Party; provided,  however, such termination will be effective only
after such breach remains substantially uncured for 30 days after written notice
specifying such breach is received by the breaching Party.

         (b) by a  Party  in the  event  (i) the  other  Party  makes a  general
assignment for the benefit of creditors,  (ii) the other Party files a voluntary
petition in bankruptcy or petitions for  reorganization  or similar  arrangement
under the bankruptcy  laws,  (iii) a petition in bankruptcy is filed against the
other Party by a third party and such  petition is not  dismissed  within ninety
days of its filing date,  or (iv) a receiver or trustee is appointed  for all or
any part of the property and assets of the other Party;

         (c) with  respect  to a program  specified  in a Service  Addendum,  by
Customer  in the  event  Customer  discontinues  (by sale or  abandonment)  such
program; provided,  however, that a termination pursuant to this subsection will
be  effective  no earlier  than six months  after  INSpire's  receipt of written
notice of such program's termination pursuant to this subsection; or

         (d) with  respect to any state in which  Customer  maintains  a program
specified in a Service  Addendum,  by written  notice from Customer in the event
such Customer  becomes subject to a cease and desist order or decree issued by a
public authority exercising valid jurisdiction over such Customer in such state.

Section 7.2  Procedure  Upon  Expiration  and  Termination.  Upon  expiration or
termination of this Agreement or any Service Addendum:

         (a) Return of Supplies.  INSpire will  promptly  return to Customer any
forms or other  supplies  imprinted  with  Customer's or its  Affiliate's  name,
regardless of who incurred the cost for same as well other  supplies paid for by
Customer;

         (b) Provide Files. INSpire will provide promptly to customer a tape (or
other then-current  technology) back-up of all data files in a format reasonably
requested  by Customer  and the  personnel  necessary to assist with the records
layout  and file  structures  of the data  files  for  Customer.  The  costs and
expenses associated with complying with this subsection will be borne by (i) the
breaching Party in the event of a termination  pursuant to Section 7.1(a),  (ii)
by the other Party in the event of a termination  pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and
(iii) by Customer in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(c).

         (c) No Relief for Breach.  Such  expiration or termination  will not in
any way limit, restrict or relieve any Party of liability for any breach of this
agreement or the applicable Service Addendum.

         (d) Payment of Termination  Fee. Each Party  acknowledges  that INSpire
agree to provide  Customer an option to terminate a program  pursuant to Section
7.1(c) in reliance on, and in anticipation of, Customer's absolute obligation to
pay the applicable  Termination Fee associated with the terminated  program.  As
used in this  subsection,  "Termination  Fee"  means  the  aggregate  amount  of
INSpire's  unamortized costs associated with the terminated  program,  including

                                       17
<PAGE>

(i)  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  (ii)  implementation  costs  and  (iii)
transaction  costs (e.g. legal fees,  accounting fees, etc.). Each Party further
acknowledges  that the amount of the  Termination  Fee is not punitive in nature
and represents the Parties' best estimate of INSpire's stranded costs associated
with an early termination of the specific program. As such, Customer will pay to
INSpire,  upon the termination of the program  pursuant to Section  7.1(c),  the
Termination Fee.

         (e)  Payment  Obligation.   Each  Party  acknowledges  that  Customer's
termination  of a program  pursuant to Section  7.1(d)  will (i) impose  certain
financial hardships on INSpire and (ii) result in Customer's absolute obligation
to pay an  amount  equal to the  Addendum  Services  Fees  (associated  with the
terminated  program  in such  state)  paid  to  INSpire  for the six (6)  months
immediately  preceding the termination  pursuant to Section  7.1(d).  Each Party
further  acknowledges  that such amount is not punitive in nature and represents
the  Parties'  best  estimate  of the  financial  hardship  suffered  by INSpire
associated with an early  termination of the specific  program in such state. As
such,  Customer  will pay to  INSpire,  upon the  termination  of a program in a
particular  state  pursuant  to Section  7.1(d),  the amount  specified  in this
subsection.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.
                      REMEDIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Section 8.1  Indemnification of the Parties.  Each Party (the "Indemnitor") will
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless any other Party (the "Indemnitee") from and
against any arbitration  award,  claim,  cost, damage,  demand,  expense,  fine,
liability,  lawsuit,  obligation,  payment  or  penalty  of any  kind or  nature
whatsoever,  including any reasonable  attorneys'  fees and expenses (a "Claim")
incurred  by the  Indemnitee  that  arises  out of or  directly  relates  to the
Indemnitor's  performance or breach of this  Agreement or any Service  Addendum.
Any series of Claims  incurred by an Indemnitee that arise out of or relate to a
common cause or  occurrence  will be deemed to be a single Claim for purposes of
this Agreement.  Upon an Indemnitee's request, the Indemnitor will indemnify the
Indemnitee's directors, employees, officers, agents, attorneys,  Representatives
and shareholders to the same extent as such Indemnitee. No such person, however,
will be a third party beneficiary of the indemnification  provision set forth in
this  Agreement.  To the extent that an  Indemnitee  requests the  Indemnitor to
indemnify  such  Party's  directors,  employees,  officers,  agents,  attorneys,
Representatives  and  shareholders,  the  Indemnitee  will cause such persons or
entities  to  comply  with  the  indemnification  provisions  and  abide  by the
indemnification limitations set forth in this Agreement.

Section 8.2 Liability Limitation.

         (a) Liability Limitation: Subject to subsection (b) below:

                                       18
<PAGE>

                  (i)  Deductible.  No Party  will be  liable  for any Claim for
damages or  indemnification  under this Agreement or any Service  Addendum until
the aggregate amount of a Claim for damages and  indemnification  for which such
Party  would  otherwise  be  responsible  exceeds  $175,000  (such  amount,  the
"Deductible")  and then such  Party will only be  responsible  for the amount in
excess of the Deductible;

                  (ii) Single Claim Maximum Amount.  No Party will be liable for
any Claim for damages or  indemnification  under this  Agreement  or any Service
Addendum  to the extent  that the amount of any single  Claim paid by such Party
exceeds  the  aggregate  amount of all the  Addendum  Services  Fees paid by the
Customers to INSpire under all then-effective Service Addendums in the one month
immediately  prior to the establishment of liability for such Claim (or the last
one month  immediately  prior to the expiration or termination of this Agreement
and all Service Addendums if applicable); and

                  (iii) Maximum  Aggregate  Amount.  No Party will be liable for
any Claim for damages or  indemnification  under this  Agreement  or any Service
Addendum to the extent that the  aggregate  amount of all Claims paid by a Party
exceeds twenty percent of the aggregate amount of all the Addendum Services Fees
paid by the  Customers to INSpire since the Addendum  Effective  Dates under all
Service  Addendums prior to the  establishment  of liability for such Claims (or
prior  to the  expiration  or  termination  of this  Agreement  and all  Service
Addendums if applicable).

         (b)  Exclusions   from  Liability   Limitation.   Notwithstanding   the
provisions of subsection (a) above, the limitations or exculpations of liability
set forth in subsection (a) above are not applicable to any Claim for damages or
indemnification  under this Agreement or any Service Addendum resulting from (i)
a breach of Articles V or VI, (ii) the willful misconduct or fraud of a Party or
its  Representatives,  (iii) any violation,  infringement or misappropriation of
any  patent,  copyright,   trademark,  trade  secret  or  other  proprietary  or
contractual  rights  of a Party or any  third  party  and or (iv)  any  payments
required, or any costs or expenses incurred, pursuant to Section 1.4(e), Section
4.9 and Section 4.10.

         (c) Exclusion of Certain Types of Damages.  No Party will be liable for
any consequential;  incidental,  punitive or special damages with respect to any
breach of this Agreement; provided, however, that this subsection will not limit
the amount of a Claim for  indemnification  (as opposed to a Claim for  damages)
which is based on an amount paid by an  Indemnitee  to an unrelated  third party
that  contains  consequential,  incidental,  punitive  or  special  damages as a
component of such amount paid by the Indemnitee to the unrelated third party.

         (d) Limitation  Acknowledgment.  Each Party expressly acknowledges that
the limitations set forth in this Section represent the express agreement of the
Parties with respect to the  allocation of risks between the Parties,  including
the level of risk to be associated with the performance of the Addendum Services
as related to the amount of the payments to be made to INSpire for such Addendum
Services,  and  each  Party  fully  understands  and  irrevocably  accepts  such
limitations.

Section 8.3 Notice of Claim. Any award of damages or indemnification pursuant to
this  Agreement is  conditioned  upon the  Indemnitor  having  received full and
prompt notice in writing of the Claim and the Indemnitee allowing the Indemnitor

                                       19
<PAGE>

to direct fully the defense or settlement of such Claim; provided, however, that
the failure to receive prompt notice  relieves the Indemnitor of its obligations
under this  Article  only if the  Indemnitor  is  materially  prejudiced  by the
failure to receive such notice.  The Indemnitor  will not be responsible for any
settlement or compromise made without its consent.

                                   ARTICLE IX.

bound by the strict  rules of procedure  and  evidence.  Arbitration  shall take
place  in  Fort  Worth,  Texas.  Insofar  as  the  arbitration  panel  looks  to
substantive  law, it shall consider the law of the State of Texas.  The decision
of any two arbitrators when rendered in writing shall be final and binding.  The
panel is empowered to grant interim relief as it may deem appropriate.

Section 9.4 Costs.  Each party shall bear the expense of its own  arbitrator and
shall  jointly  and  equally  bear  with the  other  party the cost of the third
arbitrator.  The remaining  costs of the  arbitration  shall be allocated by the
panel.  The panel may, at its discretion,  award such further costs and expenses
as it considers appropriate, including but not limited to attorneys fees, to the
extent permitted by law.

                                 SCHEDULE 1.4(e)

                                 Service Levels

The following definitions apply to the documentation titled Schedule 1.1e:

Service Level Description:

         Description of service level being measured.

Measurement:

         Performance of service level required for  determination of performance
         score only applies to business processed on INSpire Systems.

Daily Factor:

         Based  on  frequency  of  requirement  for  this  service  level  or on
         frequency of interface  availability as  appropriate.  The daily factor
         will be based on Monday  through  Friday and be assigned a daily factor
         of 5%.  If the  service  level is not  measured  the  value of N/A (not
         applicable) is present.

Weight:

         Weighting  factor  used to  determine  relative  impact  on  respective
         service level standards.

Monthly Rating:

         The purpose of the monthly rating is to develop an aggregate  score for
         measuring  INSpire's  performance  as it relates to agreed upon service
         levels. The aggregate score will be used to determine,  in aggregate if
         INSpire's performance will result in additional or reduced service fees
         for the month.

         The methodology  used to determine the aggregate score is to determine,
         for each  measurement,  whether or not INSpire met the desired  service
         level,  exceeded the service level or fell below the service level. For
         example,  the service level  average hold time is 60 seconds.  Each day
         the average hold time is 60 seconds,  INSpire will have met the service
         level.  If the  average  hold time is greater  than 60 seconds due to a
         reason  resulting  from a direct  omission or commission on the part of
         INSpire,  INSpire  will have  fallen  below the service  level.  If the
         average hold time is less than 60 seconds,  INSpire will have  exceeded
         the service level.

         Every time,  (daily in this  example)  that  INSpire  meets the service
         level,  a score of one (1) is earned.  If the service  level is not met
         for a reason that  INSpire is  responsible  for, a score of zero (0) is
         earned.  If the service  level is not met, but not due to a reason that
         INSpire is  responsible  for, a score of one (1) is earned.  Should the

                                       1

         service  level be  exceeded,  INSpire will earn a score of two (2). The
         following provides an example of one (1) month results:

                          18            Met SLA                        1
                          19            Met SLA                        1
                          20            Met SLA                        1
                                                                      --
                                                    TOTAL SCORE       20


         The total score for the SLA is then  divided by the number of times the
         SLA is applicable for the month.  In this case 20/20=1,  for a score of
         100% for this  SLA.  The  individual  score is then  multiplied  by the
         weighing factor of %, resulting in a weighed score, in this example, of
         5%.

         At the end of each month,  a weighed  score using the same  methodology
         will be used to determine an aggregate  score.  The aggregate  score of
         each  individual SLA will be added  together.  INSpire and the Customer
         will mutually agree upon aggregate scores each month.

         If the  aggregate  score is between 100% and 95%, no  adjustment to the
         service  fees will be made.  For every  percentage  point  above  100%,
         INSpire  will  receive an  additional  .5% in service fees subject to a
         maximum of 5%.  For every  percentage  point  below  95%,  the  monthly
         service fee will be reduced by .5%, subject to a maximum of 5%.

         Service  fees  subject  to  this  provision  include  only  those  fees
         indicated for policy and claims administration.

                           caused  by  Millers  personnel  or  activities.  This
                           break/fix  support time will not count toward the 130

         6.       Additional Terms:
                  ----------------

         As consideration for the above pricing structure,  it is further agreed
that:

         o        As of Effective Date:

                  o        Millers   Casualty   system  becomes  a  Claims  only
                           environment.  No further policy  processing or cycles
                           will be run except that the system  must  continue to
                           run Claims and Accounting cycles for as long as there
                           is Claims activity. All Test and QA environments will
                           be disassembled and data removed from all systems. If
                           any changes or  technical  support are  required  for
                           this system after  Effective  Date,  all  programming
                           efforts  and/or  technician  time  will  be  billable
                           except as otherwise provided herein. Any changes will
                           be made directly in the production environment.

                  o        INSpire will not cover the WINS system as part of its
                           disaster  recovery  plan. In the event of a disaster,
                           INSpire will not recover the WINS system in INSpire's
                           disaster  site.  INSpire will continue to run backups
                           on the system  which would  enable it to recover this
                           system at a later date.

                  o        INSpire will not cover the Millers Casualty system as
                           part of its disaster recovery plan. In the event of a
                           disaster,   INSpire  will  not  recover  the  Millers
                           Casualty system at INSpire's  disaster site.  INSpire
                           will  continue  to run  backups on the  system  which
                           would  enable it to  recover  this  system at a later
                           date.

                  o        All  hardware  and  information   pertaining  to  the
                           Coverall system as it resides within the INSpire Data
                           Center, will be eliminated.

                  o        There  will  no  longer  be a  scheduled  time  for a
                           Desktop technician on-site at Millers.

                  o        Millers will be responsible  for tape mounts and tape
                           rotation  planning for the systems that reside at the
                           Millers premise.

                  o        All  efforts  required  to make  the  system  changes
                           necessary to enable INSpire to reduce the cost of the
                           IT Contract  per Millers  request,  will count toward
                           the 130 hour cap but such  reduction in the cap shall
                           not exceed 40 hours.

         o        This  agreement  has taken into  consideration,  the following
                  future  events.  Subject  to the above  sixty  (60) day notice
                  requirement  relating to reduction  in  processing  needs,  no
                  further  price  reduction  will  occur  as a  result  of these
                  specific events:

                           environment.  No further policy  processing or cycles
                           will be run (INSpire  will continue to run Claims and
                           Accounting   cycles   as  long  as  there  is  Claims
                           activity).  All  Test  and QA  environments  will  be
                           disassembled  and data removed  from all systems.  If
                           any changes or technical support are required to this
                           system after 01/01/02, all programming efforts and/or
                           technician time will be billable. Any changes will be
                           made directly to the Production Environment.

                  o        11/01/02 - Millers  SPL/WPC  system  becomes a claims
                           only  environment.  No further  policy  processing or
                           cycles  will be run  (INSpire  will  continue  to run
                           Claims  and  Accounting  cycles  as long as  there is
                           Claims  activity).  All Test and QA environments will
                           be disassembled and data removed from all systems. If
                           any changes or technical support are required to this
                           system after 11/01/02, all programming efforts and/or
                           technician time will be billable. Any changes will be
                           made directly to the Production Environment.

                  o        01/01/03 - WINS system can be  completely  turned off
                           and removed  from the systems and WINS only  hardware
                           can be eliminated.

                  life of file  handling  or into  litigation,  whichever  comes
                  first.  The  fee  for  handling  the  pending  will be paid by
                  Millers in three  equal  installments  on  September  1, 2001,
                  December 1, 2001 and March 1, 2002. (1/3 each)

         (2)      Commencing  January 1, 2002,  Millers will begin  handling the

E.       REOPENED  CLAIMS:  If a rile  is  reopened  because  a new  claim  (not
         previously known or ascertainable by INSpire) is presented, it shall be
         treated  like a new  claim.  If a file is opened  for any other  reason

<PAGE>

         (such as an issue was not  finally  resolved  at the time of  closing),
         there shall be no charge for continued handling of such file.

F.       DEFINITIONS: As used in this Amendment, the term "Discontinued Program"
         shall have the following meaning:

                  "Discontinued  Program"  shall mean a program for which no new
                  business  or renewals  are written or accepted  and that has a
                  systemic  play  in  place  for   non-renewing   any  remaining
                  business.
