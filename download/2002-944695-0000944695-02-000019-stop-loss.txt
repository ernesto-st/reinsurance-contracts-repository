Reinsurance Coverage
         Lincoln shall reimburse Allmerica for Reinsured Claims.
         (Capitalized words are defined in either the "Definitions"
         article or the Schedules.)

Exclusions
A.       The following items shall be excluded from the calculation
         of Net Retained Claims:
                  (1) Claims for any benefit provided pursuant to the
                      Policies other than claims for Covered Benefits.
                  (2) Claims in excess of the Maximum Reimbursement
                      Amount per life.
                  (3) Claims resulting from Policies acquired by
                      Allmerica after the Effective Date through
                      merger, consolidation, purchase, assumption
                      reinsurance or otherwise, unless Lincoln
                      expressly agrees by means of an amendment to
                      this Agreement that such Policies shall be
                      reinsured.
                  (4) Any loss adjustment or unusual expenses
                      incurred by Allmerica in connection with the
                      Policies.
                  (5) Any punitive, exemplary, consequential or other
                      extracontractual damages incurred by Allmerica
                      in connection with the Policies.
B.       Notwithstanding any other provision, coverage of excess of
         loss reinsurance underwritten by Allmerica that covers any
         other excess of loss reinsurance ("XL on XL Reinsurance")
         is excluded from this Agreement. Losses and/or liabilities
         arising out of any XL on XL Reinsurance are specifically
         excluded from the coverage of this Agreement. The terms
         of this exclusion controls and supersedes any provisions of
         the Agreement which may be in conflict with this exclusion.

Reinsurance Premiums
         As a condition precedent to Lincoln's obligation under this
         Agreement, Allmerica shall pay Lincoln a reinsurance
         premium of one million dollars ($1,000,000) each calendar
         quarter within thirty (30) days following the end of each
         calendar quarter.


                                       1

Reports
A.       Allmerica shall notify Lincoln whenever it appears likely
         that Allmerica's aggregate claims under the Policies during
         the Coverage Period and Renewability will exceed the
         Attachment Point.
B.       Within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar
         quarter, Allmerica shall submit a report to Lincoln in
         substantial conformity with the Report Schedule.
C.       If the report indicates that there are any incurred but
         unreported claims, claims in the course of settlement or
         resisted claims still to be settled, Allmerica shall submit
         updated reports within twenty (20) days of the end of each
         calendar quarter thereafter until all such items have been
         finally settled.

Reimbursement of Losses
A.       Lincoln shall accept Allmerica's good faith settlement of
         claims under the Policies. However, when requested,
         Allmerica shall provide Lincoln with copies of any
         documentation within Allmerica's possession with respect to
         specific claims under the Policies or with respect to items
         used to compute Net Retained Claims or the Attachment
         Point.
B.       If a report submitted by Allmerica indicates an amount due
         from Lincoln pursuant to this Agreement, Lincoln shall pay
         the amount due within thirty (30) days after receiving the
         report, except that if Lincoln reasonably concludes that it
         needs to audit the validity of a claim made hereunder, the
         date on which a claim payment is due from Lincoln shall be
         extended until after the completion of Lincoln's audit.

Acknowledgments
A.       Allmerica acknowledges having provided Lincoln with
         certain information used by Lincoln in making its
         underwriting decision to provide reinsurance for the
         Coverage Period and Renewability.
B.       Allmerica affirms that all assumptions made in this
         underwriting material were based upon informed judgment
         and are consistent with sound actuarial principles. Further,
         Allmerica affirms that all facts contained in the underwriting
         material were correct, complete and accurate as of the date
         of the underwriting material.


                                       2

C.       Allmerica affirms that all assumptions made in preparing its
         Annual Statement were based upon informed judgment and
         are consistent with sound actuarial principles.
D.       Allmerica affirms that there has been no Material Change in
         Allmerica's financial condition and the expected experience
         of the Policies between the dates of the underwriting
         material and Annual Statement and the beginning of the
         Coverage Period and Renewability.
E.       Allmerica acknowledges that Lincoln has relied on the
         underwriting material and Annual Statement when offering
         to provide reinsurance for the Coverage Period and
         Renewability.

Experience Refund
         Lincoln shall pay Allmerica an Experience Refund if earned
         in accordance with the Experience Refund Schedule.

Covenants
A.       Except as set forth in paragraph D below, during the
         Coverage Period and Renewability Allmerica shall not
         permit a Material Change to
         (1) its normal underwriting practices and procedures
             when issuing Policies;
         (2) its normal practices and procedures of
             investigating and administering claims; and
         (3) its method of determining any value used to
             compute Net Retained Claims when preparing its
             Annual Statement.
B.       Except as set forth in paragraph D, Allmerica shall not
         permit a Material Change in any other reinsurance,
         proportional or nonproportional, which it maintains on the
         Policies as of the beginning of the Coverage Period and
         Renewability, including any Material Change to its limit of
         retention on the Policies.
C.       Except as set forth in paragraph D, Allmerica shall not
         assign, sell, assumption reinsure or otherwise transfer any
         Policy if such transfer would effect a Material Change to
         Net Retained Claims.
D.       Allmerica shall promptly notify Lincoln in writing of its
         intent to take any action which, if performed, would breach
         one or more of the covenants contained in this article. If
         Lincoln determines that such action would not adversely
         affect its economic interests under this Agreement, it shall


                                       3
<PAGE>

         consent to the action by Allmerica. If Lincoln becomes
         aware that any covenant contained in this article has been
         breached, it may notify Allmerica in writing that this
         Agreement is terminated from the beginning of the
         Coverage Period and Renewability.

Audit
         Lincoln may audit, at any reasonable time and at its own
         expense, all records and procedures relating to reinsurance
         under this Agreement. Allmerica shall cooperate in the
         audit, including providing at its own expense at the office of
         Lincoln any information requested by Lincoln in advance of
         the audit.

Insolvency
A.       In the event of the insolvency of Allmerica and the
         appointment of a conservator, liquidator or statutory
         successor of Allmerica, reinsurance shall be payable to such
         conservator, liquidator or statutory successor on the basis of
         claims allowed against Allmerica by any court of competent
         jurisdiction or by the conservator, liquidator or statutory
         successor of Allmerica without diminution because of the
         insolvency of Allmerica or because such conservator,
         liquidator or statutory successor has failed to pay all or a
         portion of any claims.
B.       In the event of the insolvency of Allmerica, the liquidator,
         receiver or other statutory successor of Allmerica agrees to
         give Lincoln written notice of the pendency of a claim on a
         Policy within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in
         the insolvency proceeding. During the pendency of such
         claim, Lincoln may investigate the claim and interpose in
         the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated in the
         name of Allmerica (its conservator, liquidator or statutory
         successor), but at its own expense, any defense or defenses
         which Lincoln may deem available to Allmerica or its
         conservator, liquidator or statutory successor.
C.       A proportionate share of the expense thus incurred by
         Lincoln shall be charged, subject to court approval, against
         Allmerica as part of the expense of liquidation.


                                       4

Offset
         Any debts or credits, matured or unmatured, liquidated or
         unliquidated, regardless of when they arose or where
         incurred, in favor of or against either Allmerica or Lincoln
         with respect to this Agreement or any other reinsurance
         agreement between the parties, shall be offset and only the
         balance allowed or paid. If either Allmerica or Lincoln is
         under formal delinquency proceedings, this right of offset
         shall be subject to the laws of the state exercising primary
         jurisdiction over such delinquency proceedings.

Errors
         Any Error made by either Allmerica or Lincoln in the
         administration of reinsurance under this Agreement shall be
         corrected by restoring both Allmerica and Lincoln to the
         positions they would have occupied had no such Error
         occurred.

Arbitration
A.       If Allmerica and Lincoln cannot mutually resolve a dispute
         regarding the interpretation or operation of this Agreement,
         the dispute shall be decided through arbitration as set forth
         in the Arbitration Schedule. The arbitrators shall base their
         decision on the terms and conditions of this Agreement plus,
         as necessary, on the customs and practices of the insurance
         and reinsurance industry rather than solely on a strict
         interpretation of the applicable law. There shall be no
         appeal from their decision, except that either party may
         petition a court having jurisdiction over the parties and the
         subject matter to reduce the arbitrator's decision to
         judgment.
B.       The parties intend this article to be enforceable in
         accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.,
         Section 1) including any amendments to that Act which are
         subsequently adopted. In the event that either party refuses
         to submit to arbitration as required by paragraph A, the other
         party may request a United States Federal District Court to
         compel arbitration in accordance with the Federal
         Arbitration Act. Both parties consent to the jurisdiction of
         such court to enforce this article and to confirm and enforce
         the performance of any award of the arbitrators.

Deferred Acquisition Cost Tax Election
A.       Lincoln and Allmerica each acknowledge that it is subject to
         taxation under Subchapter "L" of the Internal Revenue Code
         of 1986 (the "Code").
B.       With respect to this Agreement, Lincoln and Allmerica
         agree to the following pursuant to Section 1.848-2(g)(8) of
         the Income Tax Regulations issued December 1992,
         whereby
                  (1) each party shall attach a schedule to its federal
                      income tax return which identifies this
                      Agreement for which the joint election under the
                      Regulation has been made;
                  (2) the party with net positive consideration, as
                      defined in the Regulation promulgated under
                      Code Section 848, for this Agreement for each
                      taxable year, shall capitalize specified policy
                      acquisition expenses with respect to this
                      Agreement without regard to the general
                      deductions limitation of Section 848(c)(1);
                  (3) each party agrees to exchange information
                      pertaining to the amount of net consideration
                      under this Agreement each year to ensure
                      consistency; and
                  (4) this election shall be effective for the year that
                      this Agreement was entered into and for all
                      subsequent years that this Agreement remains in
                      effect.

Entire Agreement
A.       This Agreement represents the entire agreement between
         Allmerica and Lincoln and supersedes any prior oral or
         written agreements between the parties regarding its subject
         matter.
B.       No modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless
         set forth in a written amendment executed by both parties.
C.       A waiver of a right created by this Agreement shall
         constitute a waiver only with respect to the particular
         circumstance for which it is given and not a waiver of any
         future circumstance.

Parties to the Agreement
         This is an Agreement for indemnity reinsurance solely
         between Allmerica and Lincoln. The acceptance of
         reinsurance under this Agreement shall not create any right
         or legal relation between Lincoln and any policyowner,
         insured or beneficiary under any Policy.

Effective Date
         The Effective Date of this Agreement is set forth in the
         Coverage Schedule.

Definitions
A.       Annual Statement - the annual financial statement filed by
         Allmerica with the insurance regulatory body of its state,
         province or country of domicile computed in accordance
         with all applicable laws and regulations of such jurisdiction.
B.       Error - any isolated, inadvertent deviation from the terms of
         this Agreement resulting from the act or omission of an
         employee of either Allmerica or Lincoln whose principal
         function is administrative in nature.
C.       Material Change - a modification to a practice, procedure
         or condition which a prudent insurance executive would
         consider as likely to impact on experience under this
         Agreement.
D.       Net Retained Claims - claims for Covered Benefits
         incurred by Allmerica during the Treaty Year and retained
         by it at its own risk without benefit of reinsurance other than
         that provided pursuant to this Agreement. "Net Retained
         Claims" shall be computed in the same manner as that used
         to prepare Allmerica's Annual Statement and the
         underwriting material. They shall equal
                  (1) paid claims incurred during the Treaty Year for
                      Covered Benefits under the Policies; less
                  (2) reinsurance proceeds deemed recoverable
                      pursuant to other reinsurance agreements; less
                  (3) amounts therein which exceed the Maximum
                      Reimbursement Amount per Life.
E.       Reimbursement Percentage - the percentage specified in
         the Coverage Schedule used to compute the portion of Net
         Retained Claims in excess of the Attachment Point which
         are to be reimbursed by Lincoln.
F.       Reinsured Claims - the reimbursement percentage of Net
         Retained Claims incurred by Allmerica pursuant to the
         Policies during the Treaty Year which exceeds the
         Attachment Point, provided that Lincoln's reimbursement
         shall not exceed the Aggregate Maximum Reimbursement
         Amount.

                           EXPERIENCE REFUND SCHEDULE
                      (Effective as of September 30, 2001)
                                       to
                               Agreement Number 5

A. Experience Refund
          1.   The Experience  Refund shall be computed with respect to a Treaty
               Year and shall be  calculated  on an accrued  basis each calendar
               quarter.  The Cumulative  Experience Refund shall be equal to the
               greater of zero dollars ($0) and the following formula amount:
               (a)  Cumulative  Experience  Refund  at  end  of  prior  calendar
                    quarter; plus
               (b)  Reinsurance premiums paid during calendar quarter; less
               (b)  Reinsured Claims for calendar quarter; less
               (c)  Risk Premium Charge for calendar quarter.
          2.   The Experience  Refund due Allmerica from Lincoln shall equal the
               greater of zero dollars ($0) and the Cumulative Experience Refund
               at the end of the current  calendar  quarter less the  Cumulative
               Experience Refund at the end of the prior calendar quarter.
          3.   If the formula  amount for the  Cumulative  Experience  Refund is
               negative,  a loss carryforward  shall be created.  The Experience
               Refund Loss  Carryforward  shall equal the absolute value of such
               amount. The Experience Refund Loss Carryforward shall be deducted
               in the calculation of the Cumulative Experience Refund at the end
               of the next calendar quarter.

B. Risk Premium Charge
   For each calendar quarter, the Risk Premium Charge is thirty-seven thousand
   five hundred  dollars  ($37,500) plus .25 percent (0.25%) of reserve credit
   taken plus reimbursement of cost, paid by Lincoln to its  retrocessionaire,
   of letters of credit used to support reserve credit taken by Lincoln.

                              ARBITRATION SCHEDULE
                      (Effective as of September 30, 2001)
                                       to
                               Agreement Number 5

     Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
     be settled by arbitration.

     There  must be three  (3)  arbitrators  who must be  impartial  and must be
     present or former officers of life insurance or life reinsurance  companies
     other  than the  parties or their  affiliates.  Each of the  parties  shall
     appoint  one (1) of the  arbitrators  and these two (2)  arbitrators  shall
     select the third (the "Umpire"). In the event that either party should fail
     to choose an arbitrator within thirty (30) days following a written request
     by the  other  party to do so,  the  requesting  party may  choose  two (2)
     arbitrators  who  shall in turn  choose  an  Umpire  before  entering  upon
     arbitration. If the two (2) arbitrators fail to agree upon the selection of
     an Umpire within thirty (30) days following their appointment, either party
     may ask ARIAS-US to appoint the Umpire.  However,  if ARIAS-US is unable to
     appoint an Umpire who is  impartial  and who is or was an officer of a life
     insurance  or life  reinsurance  company  other  than the  parties or their
     affiliates,  then  either  party  may ask a court  to  appoint  the  Umpire
     pursuant to the Uniform  Arbitration Act or any similar statute  empowering
     the court to appoint an arbitrator,  in which case the requirement that the
     Umpire  be a  present  or  former  officer  of a  life  insurance  or  life
     reinsurance company shall be waived.

     The  arbitrators  shall  decide all  matters by majority  vote.  They shall
     establish the procedural  rules for the  arbitration and allocate among the
     parties  the  expenses  of  the  arbitration.  They  shall  interpret  this
     Agreement  as an  honorable  engagement  and are not  bound  by the  strict
     formalities of law. They are not empowered to assess punitive damages.

     The  arbitration  panel  shall  determine  all  arbitration  schedules  and
     procedural  rules.  Organizational  and  other  meetings  shall  be held in
     Worcester, Massachusetts, unless the panel shall select another location.

     The award agreed by the  arbitrators  will be final,  and  judgement may be
     entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction.
