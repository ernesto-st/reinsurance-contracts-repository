                            AND THE LETTERS OF CREDIT

            SECTION 2.01. The Advances. (a) THE TERM A ADVANCES. Each Term A
Lender has made a single advance (a "TERM A ADVANCE") to the Canadian Borrower
on the Closing Date under the Original Credit Agreement in an amount of such
Lender's Term A Commitment at such time. The Term A Borrowing consisted of Term
A Advances made simultaneously by the Term A Lenders ratably according to their
Term A Commitments. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(a) and repaid or
prepaid may not be reborrowed.

            (b) THE TERM B ADVANCES. Each Term B Lender has made a single
advance (a "TERM B ADVANCE") to the U.S. Borrower on the Closing Date under the
Original Credit Agreement in an amount of such Lender's Term B Commitment at
such time. The Term B Borrowing consisted of Term B Advances made simultaneously
by the Term B Lenders ratably according to their Term B Commitments. Amounts
borrowed under this Section 2.01(b) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

            (c) THE REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCES. Each Revolving Credit Lender
severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make
advances (each a "REVOLVING CREDIT ADVANCE") to the U.S. Borrower from time to
time on any Business Day during the period from the date of the Original Credit
Agreement until the Termination Date in an amount for each such Advance not to
exceed such Lender's Unused Revolving Credit Commitment at such time. Each
Revolving Credit Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of $2,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (other than a Borrowing the
proceeds of which shall be used solely to repay or prepay in full outstanding
Swing Line Advances or outstanding Letter of Credit Advances) and shall consist
of Revolving Credit Advances made simultaneously by the Revolving Credit Lenders
ratably according to their Revolving Credit Commitments. Within the limits of
each Revolving Credit Lender's Unused Revolving Credit Commitment in effect from
time to time, the U.S. Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(c), prepay
pursuant to Section 2.06(a) and reborrow under this Section 2.01(c).

            (d) THE SWING LINE ADVANCES. The U.S. Borrower may request the Swing
Line Bank to make, and the Swing Line Bank shall make, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, Swing Line Advances to the U.S. Borrower from
time to time on any Business Day during the period from the date of the Original
Credit Agreement until the Termination Date in an aggregate amount not to exceed

FACILITY") and (ii) an amount not to

<Page>
                                       32

exceed the aggregate of the Unused Revolving Credit Commitments of the Revolving
Credit Lenders at such time. No Swing Line Advance shall be used for the purpose
of funding the payment of principal of any other Swing Line Advance. Each Swing
Line Borrowing shall be in an amount of $500,000 or an integral multiple of
$250,000 in excess thereof and shall be made as a Base Rate Advance. Within the
limits of the Swing Line Facility and within the limits referred to in clause
(ii) above, the U.S. Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(d), repay
pursuant to Section 2.04(d) or prepay pursuant to Section 2.06(a) and reborrow
under this Section 2.01(d).

            (e) LETTERS OF CREDIT. The Issuing Bank agrees, on the terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth, to issue letters of credit (the "LETTERS OF
CREDIT") for the account of the U.S. Borrower from time to time on any Business
Day during the period from the date of the Original Credit Agreement until five
Business Days before the Termination Date (i) in an aggregate Available LC
Amount for all Letters of Credit not to exceed at any time the Issuing Bank's
Letter of Credit Commitment at such time and (ii) in an Available LC Amount for
each such Letter of Credit not to exceed an amount equal to the Unused Revolving
Credit Commitments of the Revolving Credit Lenders at such time. No Letter of
Credit shall have an expiration date (including all rights of the U.S. Borrower
or the beneficiary to require renewal) later than the earlier of five Business
Days before the Termination Date and (A) in the case of a Standby Letter of
Credit, one year after the date of issuance thereof, but may by its terms be
renewable annually upon notice (a "NOTICE OF RENEWAL") given to the Issuing Bank
and the Administrative Agent on or prior to any date for notice of renewal set
forth in such Letter of Credit (but in any event at least three Business Days
prior to the date of the proposed renewal of such Standby Letter of Credit) and
upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, unless
such Issuing Bank has notified the U.S. Borrower (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) on or prior to the date for notice of termination set
forth in such Letter of Credit (but in any event at least 30 Business Days prior
to the date of automatic renewal) of its election not to renew such Standby
Letter of Credit (a "NOTICE OF TERMINATION") and (B) in the case of a Trade
Letter of Credit, the later of 180 days after the date of issuance thereof or
five Business Days before the Termination Date; PROVIDED that the terms of each
Standby Letter of Credit that is automatically renewable annually shall (x)
require the Issuing Bank that issued such Standby Letter of Credit to give the
beneficiary named in such Standby Letter of Credit notice of any Notice of
Termination, (y) permit such beneficiary, upon receipt of such notice, to draw
under such Standby Letter of Credit prior to the date such Standby Letter of
Credit otherwise would have been automatically renewed and (z) not permit the
expiration date (after giving effect to any renewal) of such Standby Letter of
Credit in any event to be extended to a date later than 60 days before the
Termination Date. If either a Notice of Renewal is not given by the U.S.
Borrower or a Notice of Termination is given by the Issuing Bank pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, such Standby Letter of Credit shall expire on
the date on which it otherwise would have been automatically renewed; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that even in the absence of receipt of a Notice of Renewal the Issuing
Bank may in its discretion, unless instructed to the contrary by the
Administrative Agent or the U.S. Borrower, deem that a Notice of Renewal had
been timely delivered and in such case, a Notice of Renewal shall be deemed to
have been so delivered for all purposes under this Agreement. Within the limits
of the Letter of Credit Facility, and subject to the limits referred to above,
the U.S. Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit under this
Section 2.01(e), repay any Letter of Credit Advances resulting from drawings
thereunder pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and request the issuance of additional
Letters of Credit under this Section 2.01(e).

            (f) THE TERM C ADVANCES. Each Term C Lender severally agrees, on the
terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make a single advance (a "TERM C
ADVANCE") to the U.S. Borrower on any Business Day during the period from the
date hereof until April 16, 1999, in an amount not to exceed such Lender's Term
C Commitment at such time. The Term C Borrowing shall consist of Term C Advances
made simultaneously by the Term C Lenders ratably according to their Term C
Commitments. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(f) and repaid or prepaid
may not be reborrowed.

                                       33

            SECTION 2.02. MAKING THE ADVANCES. (a) Except as otherwise provided
in Section 2.02(b) or 2.03, each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not
later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to
the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, or the first Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances,
by the Appropriate Borrower to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to
each Appropriate Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Term C Borrowing hereunder shall consist of Base Rate Advances
and shall be made on notice, given not later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City
time) on the Business Day of the proposed Term C Borrowing, by the U.S. Borrower
to the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Appropriate Lender prompt
notice thereof by telex or telecopier. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a
"NOTICE OF BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing,
or telex or telecopier, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto,
specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Facility under
which such Borrowing is to be made, (iii) Type of Advances comprising such
Borrowing, (iv) aggregate amount of such Borrowing and (v) in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period for
each such Advance. Each Appropriate Lender shall, before 12:00 P.M. (New York
City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing in accordance with the respective Commitments under the applicable
Facility of such Lender and the other Appropriate Lenders. After the
Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the
applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent will
make such funds available to the Appropriate Borrower by crediting the
applicable Borrower's Account; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, in the case of any
Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall first make a portion
of such funds equal to the aggregate principal amount of any Swing Line Advances
and Letter of Credit Advances made by the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing Bank,
as the case may be, and by any other Revolving Credit Lender and outstanding on
the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, plus interest accrued and unpaid
thereon to and as of such date, available to the Swing Line Bank or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, and such other Revolving Credit Lenders for repayment
of such Swing Line Advances and Letter of Credit Advances.

            (b) Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not
later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Swing Line
Borrowing, by the U.S. Borrower to the Swing Line Bank and the Administrative
Agent. Each such notice of a Swing Line Borrowing (a "NOTICE OF SWING LINE
BORROWING") shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or
telecopier, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii)
amount of such Borrowing and (iii) maturity of such Borrowing (which maturity
shall be no later than the seventh day after the requested date of such
Borrowing). The Swing Line Bank will make the amount thereof available to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds.
After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of
the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Administrative Agent
will make such funds available to the U.S. Borrower by crediting its Borrower's
Account. Upon written demand by the Swing Line Bank, with a copy of such demand
to the Administrative Agent, each other Revolving Credit Lender shall purchase
from the Swing Line Bank, and the Swing Line Bank shall sell and assign to each
such other Revolving Credit Lender, such other Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
outstanding Swing Line Advance as of the date of such demand, by making
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Swing Line Bank, by deposit to the Administrative
Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the
outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such
Lender. The U.S. Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding
Swing Line Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by
the Swing Line Bank, PROVIDED that notice of such demand is given not later than
1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first

<Page>
                                       34

Business Day next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after
such time. Upon any such assignment by the Swing Line Bank to any other
Revolving Credit Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, the Swing Line
Bank represents and warrants to such other Lender that the Swing Line Bank is
the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes
no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to such Swing Line Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the
extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Swing Line Advance available to the Administrative Agent, such Revolving
Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by
the Swing Line Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative
Agent such amount for the account of the Swing Line Bank on any Business Day,
such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line
Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement,
and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by the Swing
Line Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

            (c) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary
notwithstanding, (i) neither Borrower may select Eurodollar Rate Advances for
the initial Borrowing hereunder or for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of
such Borrowing is less than $2,000,000 or if the obligation of the Appropriate
Lenders to make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to
Section 2.09 or Section 2.10 and (ii) the Term A Advances may not be outstanding
as part of more than 3 separate Borrowings, the Term B Advances may not be
outstanding as part of more than 3 separate Borrowings, the Term C Advances may
not be outstanding as part of more than 3 separate Borrowings and the Revolving
Credit Advances made on any date may not be outstanding on any date as part of
more than 10 separate Borrowings.

            (d) Each Notice of Borrowing and Notice of Swing Line Borrowing
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Appropriate Borrower. In the case of any
Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of
Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Appropriate Borrower shall indemnify each
Appropriate Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as
a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such
Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, including, without limitation, any loss (including loss of
anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the
Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance,
as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

            (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
an Appropriate Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing under a Facility under
which such Lender has a Commitment that such Lender will not make available to
the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Appropriate Borrower on
such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall
not have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent,
such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay or pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount and to pay
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the Appropriate Borrower until the date such amount is repaid or paid to the
Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at such time under Section 2.07 to Advances comprising such Borrowing
and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender
shall pay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so
paid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for all
purposes.

                                       35

            (f) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it
as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation,
if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.03. ISSUANCE OF AND DRAWINGS AND REIMBURSEMENT UNDER
LETTERS OF CREDIT. (A) REQUEST FOR ISSUANCE. Each Letter of Credit shall be
issued upon notice, given not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the
fifth Business Day prior to the date of the proposed issuance of such Letter of
Credit, or such shorter period as may be agreed upon by the Issuing Bank, by the
U.S. Borrower to the Issuing Bank, which shall give to the Administrative Agent
and each Revolving Credit Lender prompt notice thereof by telex or telecopier.
Each such notice of issuance of a Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Issuance")
shall be by telephone, confirmed immediately in writing, or telex or telecopier,
specifying therein the requested (A) date of such issuance (which shall be a
Business Day), (B) Available LC Amount of such Letter of Credit, (C) expiration
date of such Letter of Credit, (D) name and address of the beneficiary of such
Letter of Credit and (E) form of such Letter of Credit, and shall be accompanied
by such application and agreement for letter of credit as the Issuing Bank may
specify to the U.S. Borrower for use in connection with such requested Letter of
Credit (a "Letter of Credit Agreement"). If (x) the requested form of such
Letter of Credit is acceptable to the Issuing Bank in its sole discretion and
(y) it has not received notice of objection to such issuance from the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank will, upon fulfillment of the applicable
conditions set forth in Article III, make such Letter of Credit available to the
U.S. Borrower at its office referred to in Section 9.02 or as otherwise agreed
with the U.S. Borrower in connection with such issuance. In the event and to the
extent that the provisions of any Letter of Credit Agreement shall conflict with
this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall govern.

            (b) LETTER OF CREDIT REPORTS. The Issuing Bank shall furnish (A) to
the Administrative Agent on the first Business Day of each week a written report
summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued during the
previous week and drawings during such week under all Letters of Credit, (B) to
each Revolving Credit Lender on the first Business Day of each month a written
report summarizing issuance and expiration dates of Letters of Credit issued
during the preceding month and drawings during such month under all Letters of
Credit and (C) to the Administrative Agent and each Revolving Credit Lender on
the first Business Day of each calendar quarter a written report setting forth
the average daily aggregate Available LC Amount during the preceding calendar
quarter of all Letters of Credit.

            (c) DRAWING AND REIMBURSEMENT. The payment by the Issuing Bank of a
draft drawn under any Letter of Credit shall constitute for all purposes of this
Agreement the making by the Issuing Bank of a Letter of Credit Advance, which
shall be a Base Rate Advance, in the amount of such draft. Upon written demand
by the Issuing Bank, with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent,
each Revolving Credit Lender shall purchase from the Issuing Bank, and the
Issuing Bank shall sell and assign to each such Revolving Credit Lender, such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such outstanding Letter of Credit Advance as of the
date of such purchase, by making available for the account of its Applicable
Lending Office to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank,
by deposit to the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount
equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Letter of
Credit Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Promptly after receipt thereof,
the Administrative Agent shall transfer such funds to the Issuing Bank. The U.S.
Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Revolving Credit
Lender agrees to purchase its Pro Rata Share of an outstanding Letter of Credit
Advance on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefor is made by the Issuing
Bank, provided notice of such demand is given not later than 12:00 P.M. (New
York City time) on such Business Day or (ii) the first Business Day next
succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. Upon
any such assignment by the Issuing Bank to any other Revolving

                                       36

Credit Lender of a portion of a Letter of Credit Advance, the Issuing Bank
represents and warrants to such other Lender that the Issuing Bank is the legal
and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such
Letter of Credit Advance, the Loan Documents or any Loan Party. If and to the
extent that any Revolving Credit Lender shall not have so made the amount of
such Letter of Credit Advance available to the Administrative Agent, such
Revolving Credit Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of
demand by the Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate for its account or the account
of the Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the
Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the Issuing Bank on any
Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a
Letter of Credit Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes
of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Letter of Credit
Advance made by the Issuing Bank shall be reduced by such amount on such
Business Day.

            (d) FAILURE TO MAKE LETTER OF CREDIT ADVANCES. The failure of any
Lender to make the Letter of Credit Advance to be made by it on the date
specified in Section 2.03(c) shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation hereunder to make its Letter of Credit Advance on such date, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Letter of Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on such date.

            SECTION 2.04. REPAYMENT OF ADVANCES. (a) TERM A ADVANCES. The
Canadian Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent for the ratable
account of the Term A Lenders the final principal installment of the Term A

Lenders, whereupon each such Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the
last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate
Advance.

            (vi) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Default
under Section 7.01(a), (x) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on
the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base
Rate Advance and (y) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert
Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended.

            SECTION 2.10. INCREASED COSTS, ETC. (a) In the event that, due to
either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of
imposition or increase of reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate
Reserve Percentage) in or in the interpretation or administration of any
applicable law or regulation after the Closing Date, (ii) the compliance with
any applicable guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental
authority (whether or not having the force of law) or (iii) any other
circumstance affecting the interbank Eurodollar market or the position of any
Lender Party in such market which leads such Lender Party to reasonably
determine that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Rate Advance made by such Lender Party will not adequately reflect the cost to
such Lender of making, funding or maintaining such Eurodollar

                                       43

Rate Advance for such Interest Period, there shall be any increase in the cost
to or reduction in the amount received or receivable by any Lender Party as a
result of agreeing to make or of making, funding or maintaining Eurodollar Rate
Advances or of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining Letters of Credit
or of agreeing to make or of making or maintaining Letter of Credit Advances
(excluding for purposes of this Section 2.10 any such increased costs resulting
from (A) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall govern) and (B)
changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income
by the United States or Canada or by the foreign jurisdiction or state under the
laws of which such Lender Party is organized or has its Applicable Lending
Office or any political subdivision thereof), then the U.S. Borrower shall from
time to time, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to
the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Lender Party additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender Party, in
its reasonable discretion, shall determine) sufficient to compensate such Lender
Party for such increased COST; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Lender Party claiming
additional amounts under this Section 2.10(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts
(consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
designate a different Applicable Lending Office for any Advances affected by
such event if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue; PROVIDED
that such designation is made on terms that such Lender Party and its Applicable
Lending Office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the
object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of
this subsection (a). A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost and
showing in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation thereof, submitted to
such Borrower by such Lender Party at the time of demand, shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

            (b) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or in
the interpretation or administration of any applicable law or regulation after
the Closing Date or (ii) the compliance with any applicable guideline or request
from any central bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the
force of law), there shall be any increase in the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by any Lender Party or any corporation controlling
such Lender Party which has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender Party's capital or assets as a result of or based upon the
existence of such Lender Party's commitments and obligations under this
Agreement to a level below that which such Lender Party could have achieved but
for such change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender Party's or
any corporation controlling such Lender Party's policies with respect to capital
adequacy), then, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to
the Administrative Agent), the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Lender Party, from time to time as specified by
such Lender Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party
in the light of such circumstances, it being understood and agreed that a Lender
Party shall not be entitled to such compensation as a result of such Lender
Party's compliance with, or pursuant to any request or directive to comply with,
any such law, regulation, guideline or request in effect on the Closing Date.
Any amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be payable only to the
extent that such Lender Party reasonably determines such increase in capital to
be allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or to
issue Letters of Credit hereunder or to the issuance or maintenance of any
Letters of Credit. A certificate as to such amounts and showing in reasonable
detail the basis for the calculation thereof submitted to such Borrower by such
Lender Party at the time of demand shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error.

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation shall make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental
authority shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its Eurodollar
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate
Advances or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances hereunder,
with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advance affected by circumstances described
in this subsection (c), such Borrower will, and with respect to any Eurodollar

<Page>
                                       44

Rate Advance affected by circumstances described in subsections (a) or (b)
above, such Borrower may, either (i) on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, convert each Eurodollar Rate Advance affected by such
circumstances into a Base Rate Advance or (ii) if the affected Eurodollar Rate
Advance is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, cancel such Borrowing by
giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in
writing) thereof on the same date that such Borrower was notified by a Lender
Party pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) above or this subsection (c) (as
applicable); PROVIDED that if more than one Lender Party is affected at any
time, then all affected Lender Parties must be treated in the same manner
pursuant to this Section 2.10(c). In the event of an illegality as described in
clause (i) of this subsection (c) the obligation of the Appropriate Lenders to
make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate Advances shall be suspended
until the Administrative Agent shall notify the Appropriate Borrower that such
Lender has determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, before making any such demand, such Lender Party
agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy and legal
and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending Office
for any Advances affected by such event if the making of such a designation
would allow such Lender Party or its Applicable Lending Office to continue to
perform its obligations to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to continue to fund
or maintain Eurodollar Rate Advances; PROVIDED that such designation is made on
terms that such Lender Party and its Applicable Lending Office suffer no
economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the
consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of this subsection.

            (d) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, to
the extent any notice under Section 2.10, 2.12 or 9.04(c) is given by any Lender
Party more than 180 days after such Lender Party has knowledge (or should have
had knowledge) of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the additional
cost, reduction in amounts, loss, tax or other additional amounts described in
such Section 2.10, 2.12 or 9.04(c), as the case may be, such Lender Party shall
not be entitled to compensation under such Section for any such amounts incurred
or accruing prior to the giving of such notice to the Appropriate Borrower.

            SECTION 2.11. PAYMENTS AND COMPUTATIONS. (a) Each Borrower shall
make each payment owed by it hereunder and under the Notes, irrespective of any
right of counterclaim or set-off (except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15),
not later than 12:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the day when due (or, in the
case of payments made by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01, on the date
of demand therefor) in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent's Account in same day funds. The Administrative Agent will
promptly thereafter cause like funds to be distributed (i) if such payment by a
Borrower is in respect of principal, interest, commitment fees or any other
Obligation then payable hereunder and under the Notes to more than one Lender
Party, to such Lender Parties for the account of their respective Applicable
Lending Offices ratably in accordance with the amounts of such respective
Obligations then payable to such Lender Parties and (ii) if such payment by a
Borrower is in respect of any Obligation then payable hereunder to one Lender
Party, to such Lender Party for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in
each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its
acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and recording of the information
contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 9.07(d), from and after
the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent
shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest
assigned thereby to the Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to
such Assignment and Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such
payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

            (b) If the Administrative Agent receives funds for application to
the Obligations under the Loan Documents under circumstances for which the Loan
Documents do not specify the Advances or the Facility to which, or the manner in
which, such funds are to be applied, the Administrative Agent may, but shall not
be obligated to, elect to distribute such funds to each Lender Party ratably in

<Page>
                                       45

accordance with such Lender Party's proportionate share of the principal amount
of all outstanding Advances and the Available LC Amount of all Letters of Credit
then outstanding, in repayment or prepayment of such of the outstanding Advances
or other Obligations owed to such Lender Party, and for application to such
principal installments, as the Administrative Agent shall direct.

            (c) The Borrowers hereby authorize each Lender Party, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder or, in
the case of a Lender, under the Note held by such Lender, to charge from time to
time against any or all of the Appropriate Borrower's accounts with such Lender
Party any amount so due.

            (d) All computations of interest, fees and commissions shall be made
by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest, fees or commissions are
payable; PROVIDED that (i) interest in respect of which the rate of interest is
calculated on the basis of clause (a) of the definition of "Base Rate" contained
in Section 1.01, (ii) commitment fees payable pursuant to Section 2.08(a) and
(iii) Letter of Credit fees payable pursuant to Section 2.08(b) shall be
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 (or 366, as the case may be) days for
the actual number of days elapsed; and PROVIDED FURTHER that for purposes of the
INTEREST ACT (Canada), whenever interest hereunder is to be calculated at a rate
based upon a 360 day period (the "APPLICABLE RATE"), the rate or percentage of
interest on a yearly basis is equivalent to such Applicable Rate multiplied by
the actual number of days in the year divided by 360. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee or commission hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

            (e) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as
the case may be; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if such extension would cause payment
of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next
following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

            (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Appropriate Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to any
Lender Party hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment in full,
the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in
full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each such Lender
Party on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender Party.
If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full
to the Administrative Agent, each such Lender Party shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender
Party together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Lender Party until the date such Lender Party repays such
amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

            SECTION 2.12. TAXES. (a) Any and all payments by either Borrower
hereunder or under the Notes shall be made, in accordance with Section 2.11,
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, EXCLUDING, (i) in the case of each Lender Party and the
Administrative Agent, (A) taxes that are imposed on its overall net income by
the United States and taxes that are imposed on its overall net income or, in
the case of any Term A Lender, capital (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu
thereof) by the state, province or other jurisdiction under the laws of which
such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) is organized
or any political subdivision thereof and (B) any taxes imposed on the
Administrative Agent or any Lender Party as a result of a current or

<Page>
                                       46

former connection between the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party, as the
case may be, and the jurisdiction imposing such tax or any political subdivision
or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any such connection arising
from the Administrative Agent or such Lender Party having executed, delivered or
performed its obligations or received any payment under, or sought enforcement
of, this Agreement) and, (ii) (A) in the case of each Lender Party, taxes that
are imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu
thereof) by the state, province or other jurisdiction of such Lender Party's
Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof and (B) in the
case of each Term A Lender, taxes that are imposed on its overall capital under
the federal or provincial laws of Canada (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of
payments hereunder or under the Notes being hereinafter referred to as "TAXES")
unless such Borrower is required by law or the interpretation or administration
thereof to withhold or deduct Taxes. If either Borrower shall be required by law
or the interpretation or administration thereof by the relevant taxing authority
to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder or under any
Note to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, (x) the sum payable shall
be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
2.12) such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be)
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (y) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (z) such
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority
or other authority in accordance with applicable law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
Borrower shall be required to increase any such amounts otherwise payable to a
Lender Party that is not organized under the laws of the United States or a
state thereof so long as such Lender Party fails to comply with the requirements
of subsection (e) below.

            (b) In addition, each Borrower shall pay any present or future
stamp, documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges or levies that
arise from any payment made by it hereunder or under the Notes or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, performing under, or otherwise with
respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "OTHER
TAXES").

            (c) Each Borrower shall indemnify each Lender Party and the
Administrative Agent for and hold it harmless against the full amount of Taxes
and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12, imposed on or paid by
such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be), and any
liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and expenses) arising
therefrom or with respect thereto that would not have arisen but for the
Appropriate Borrower's failure to pay any Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the
appropriate taxing authority or remit to the Administrative Agent the receipts
or other documentary evidence required under subsection (d) below. This
indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender Party or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes written demand therefor.

            (d) Promptly after the date of any payment of Taxes, the Appropriate
Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address referred to
in Section 9.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such
payment. In the case of any payment hereunder or under the Notes by or on behalf
of such Borrower through an account or branch outside the United States or by or
on behalf of such Borrower by a payor that is not a United States person, if
such Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, such
Borrower shall furnish, or shall cause such payor to furnish, to the
Administrative Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent stating that such payment is exempt from
Taxes. For purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "UNITED
STATES" and "UNITED STATES PERSON" shall have the meanings specified in Section
7701 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                                       47

            (e) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States shall, on or prior to the date of its execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender or Initial Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, and on the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each other Lender
Party, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by the U.S.
Borrower (but only so long thereafter as such Lender Party remains lawfully able
to do so), provide each of the Administrative Agent and the U.S. Borrower with
two original properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service forms
1001 or 4224 or (in the case of a Lender Party that has certified in writing to
the Administrative Agent that it is not a "bank" as defined in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code) form W-8 (and, if such Lender Party
delivers a form W-8, a certificate representing that such Lender Party is not a
"bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not a
10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the
Internal Revenue Code) of such Borrower and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to such Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the Internal Revenue Code)), as appropriate, or any successor or other form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender Party is
exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on
payments pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes or, in the case of a Lender
Party providing a form W-8, certifying that such Lender Party is a foreign
corporation, partnership, estate or trust. Each such Lender Party hereby agrees,
from time to time after the initial delivery by such Lender Party of such forms
or certificates, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders
such forms or certificates obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that
such Lender Party shall promptly (i) deliver to the U.S. Borrower and the
Administrative Agent two new original copies of Internal Revenue Service forms
1001 or 4224, or (in the case of a Lender Party that has certified in writing to
the Administrative Agent that it is not a "bank" as defined in Section
881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code) form W-8 (and, if such Lender Party
delivers a form W-8, a certificate representing that such Lender Party is not a
"bank" for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not a
10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the
Internal Revenue Code) of such Borrower and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to such Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the Internal Revenue Code)), as appropriate, properly completed and duly
executed by such Lender Party or (ii) notify the Administrative Agent and the
U.S. Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms or certificates. If the
forms provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes a
party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest withholding tax rate
in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be considered excluded
from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party provides the appropriate form
certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser
rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such
form; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if at the date of the Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which a Lender Party becomes a party to this Agreement, the Lender
Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection (a) in respect of
United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then,
to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes
that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in
Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the
Lender Party assignee on such date. If any form or document referred to in this
subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than information
necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the date of the
Original Credit Agreement (in the case of Lender Parties other than Term C
Lenders) or on the date hereof (in the case of Term C Lenders) by Internal
Revenue Service form 1001, 4224 or W-8 (or the related certificate described
above), that the Lender Party reasonably considers to be confidential, the
Lender Party shall give notice thereof to such Borrower and shall not be
obligated to include in such form or document such confidential information.

            (f) In respect of any Term A Advance made to the Canadian Borrower
by any Lender Party, such Lender Party (i) represents and warrants to the
Canadian Borrower that, in respect of any payments of interest, fees or other
amounts constituting income that would be taxable to such Term A Lender pursuant
to Part I of the INCOME TAX ACT (CANADA) made to it by the Canadian Borrower,

<Page>
                                       48

such Lender Party will be entitled to receive such payments free and clear of,
and without any obligation on the part of the Canadian Borrower to make
deduction for or on account of, any income or capital taxes imposed by Canada or
any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, PROVIDED, that
such Lender Party is a resident of Canada for purposes of the INCOME TAX ACT
(CANADA) at the time such payments are made; and (ii) agrees that if such Lender
Party is not a resident of Canada at the time such payments are made that the
Canadian Borrower may withhold and remit Taxes pursuant to subsection (a) (and
(c), if applicable) and that such Lender Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification under subsection (a) or (c) with respect to Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed by Canada or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein that arise by virtue of such Lender Party being a non-resident of Canada
for purposes of the INCOME TAX ACT (CANADA); and (iii) covenants and agrees to
promptly advise the U.S. Borrower if such Lender Party changes its residency for
purposes of the INCOME TAX ACT (CANADA) and to cooperate with the Canadian
Borrower to provide, at either Borrower's reasonable request, information
necessary to determine the amount of withholding or deduction that may be
required.

            (g) For any period with respect to which either (i) a Lender Party
has failed to provide the U.S. Borrower with the appropriate form described in
subsection (e) above (OTHER THAN if such failure is due to a change in law
occurring after the date on which a form originally was required to be provided
or if such form otherwise is not required under subsection (e) above) or (ii)
any representation or certification made by a Lender Party pursuant to
subsection (e) or (f) above is incorrect in any material respect at the time a
payment hereunder is made (other than by reason of any change in treaty, law or
regulation having effect after the date of such representation or certification
when made), such Lender Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under
subsection (a) or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States or
Canada by reason of such failure or incorrectness, as the case may be; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes because of its
failure to deliver a form required hereunder, such Borrower shall take such
steps as such Lender Party shall reasonably request to assist such Lender Party
to recover such Taxes.

            (h) Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable
pursuant to this Section 2.12 agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the
jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office or designate a different
Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change or designation would
avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that
may thereafter accrue, PROVIDED that such change or designation is made on terms
that such Lender Party and its Applicable Lending Office suffer no economic,
legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of
the event giving rise to the operation of subsection (a) or (c) above.

            (i) If the U.S. Borrower determines in good faith that a reasonable
basis exists for contesting any taxes for which indemnification has been
demanded hereunder, the relevant Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, shall cooperate with the U.S. Borrower in challenging such taxes at
the U.S. Borrower's expense if so requested by the U.S. Borrower. If any Lender
Party or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, receives a refund of a tax for
which a payment has been made by the U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section,
which refund in the good faith judgment of such Lender Party or Administrative
Agent, as the case may be, is attributable to such payment made by the U.S.
Borrower, then the Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
shall reimburse the U.S. Borrower for such amount as the Lender Party or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, determines to be the proportion of the
refund as will leave it, after such reimbursement, in no better or worse
position than it would have been in if the payment had not been required. If a
Lender Party or the Administrative Agent is required to return all or a portion
of any refund for which reimbursement was made under the preceding sentence to
the authority that granted such refund, the U.S. Borrower shall pay over to such
Lender Party or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, the portion of
such reimbursement as will leave such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, in no better or worse position than if no

<Page>
                                       49

such reimbursement had been made. A Lender Party or the Administrative Agent
shall claim any refund that it determines in good faith is available to it,
unless it concludes in its reasonable discretion that it would be adversely
affected by making such a claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Lender Party and
the Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in refusing to claim any such
refund, unless, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its
satisfaction against any expense that may be incurred by it in connection
therewith. Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the right of a Lender
or the Administrative Agent to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it
thinks fit nor oblige any Lender or the Administrative Agent to disclose any
information relating to its tax affairs or any computations in respect thereof
or require any Lender or the Administrative Agent to do anything that would
prejudice its ability to benefit from any other reliefs, remissions or
repayments to which it may be entitled.

            (j) Each Lender Party represents and agrees that, on the date hereof
and at all times during the term of this Agreement, it is not and will not be a
conduit entity participating in a conduit financing arrangement (as defined
United States Treasury regulations Section 881-3) with respect to the Borrowings
hereunder (other than a conduit financing arrangement in which the Appropriate
Borrower, or an Affiliate thereof, is a financing entity) unless the Appropriate
Borrower has consented to such arrangement prior thereto.

            SECTION 2.13. SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC. If any Lender Party shall
obtain at any time any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) (a) on account of Obligations
due and payable to such Lender Party hereunder and under the Loan Documents at
such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the
amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender Party at such time to
(ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender
Parties hereunder and under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments on
account of the Obligations due and payable to all Lender Parties hereunder and
under the Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lender Parties at such
time or (b) on account of Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to such
Lender Party hereunder and under the Loan Documents at such time in excess of
its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount
of the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties
hereunder and under the Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of
the Obligations owing (but not due and payable) to all Lender Parties hereunder
and under the Loan Documents at such time obtained by all of the Lender Parties
at such time, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender
Parties such participations in the Obligations due and payable or owing to them,
as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender Party
to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing Lender Party, such purchase from each other Lender Party shall be
rescinded and such other Lender Party shall repay to the purchasing Lender Party
the purchase price to the extent of such Lender Party's ratable share (according
to the proportion of (i) the purchase price paid to such Lender Party to (ii)
the aggregate purchase price paid to all Lender Parties) of such recovery
together with an amount equal to such Lender Party's ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such other Lender Party's required repayment
to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in
respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender
Party so purchasing a participation from another Lender Party pursuant to this
Section 2.13 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of such
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

            SECTION 2.14. USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds (i) of the Advances
(other than the Term C Advances) and issuances of Letters of Credit shall be
available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds and Letters
of Credit), directly or indirectly, solely to finance a portion of the cash

                                       50

consideration paid in connection with the Acquisition and to pay transaction
fees and expenses associated therewith, and (ii) of the Term C Advances shall be
available (and each Borrower agrees that it shall use such proceeds), directly
or indirectly, solely to refinance debt incurred by the U.S. Borrower for the
purposes of consummating the AKW Acquisition and paying transaction fees and
expenses associated therewith and to prepay in part the Revolving Credit
Advances outstanding under the Original Credit Agreement, and, in each case, to
provide working capital for the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries and for other
general corporate purposes.

            SECTION 2.15. DEFAULTING LENDERS. (a) In the event that, at any one
time, (i) any Lender Party shall be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting
Lender shall owe a Defaulted Advance to either Borrower and (iii) such Borrower
shall be required to make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan Document
to or for the account of such Defaulting Lender, then such Borrower may, so long
as no Default shall occur or be continuing at such time and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, set off and otherwise apply the Obligation
of such Borrower to make such payment to or for the account of such Defaulting
Lender against the obligation of such Defaulting Lender to make such Defaulted
Advance. In the event that, on any date, such Borrower shall so set off and
otherwise apply its obligation to make any such payment against the obligation
of such Defaulting Lender to make any such Defaulted Advance on or prior to such
date, the amount so set off and otherwise applied by such Borrower shall
constitute for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents an
Advance by such Defaulting Lender made on the date under the Facility pursuant
to which such Defaulted Advance was originally required to have been made
pursuant to Section 2.01. Such Advance shall be a Base Rate Advance and shall be
considered, for all purposes of this Agreement, to comprise part of the
Borrowing in connection with which such Defaulted Advance was originally
required to have been made pursuant to Section 2.01, even if the other Advances
comprising such Borrowing shall be Eurodollar Rate Advances on the date such
Advance is deemed to be made pursuant to this subsection (a). Each Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent at any time such Borrower exercises its
right of set-off pursuant to this subsection (a) and shall set forth in such
notice (A) the name of the Defaulting Lender and the Defaulted Advance required
to be made by such Defaulting Lender and (B) the amount set off and otherwise
applied in respect of such Defaulted Advance pursuant to this subsection (a).
Any portion of such payment otherwise required to be made by either Borrower to
or for the account of such Defaulting Lender which is paid by such Borrower,
after giving effect to the amount set off and otherwise applied by such Borrower
pursuant to this subsection (a), shall be applied by the Administrative Agent as
specified in subsection (b) or (c) of this Section 2.15.

            (b) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party shall
be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall owe a Defaulted Amount
to the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender Parties and (iii) the
Appropriate Borrower shall make any payment hereunder or under any other Loan
Document to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender,
then the Administrative Agent may, on its behalf or on behalf of such other
Lender Parties and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, apply at
such time the amount so paid by such Borrower to or for the account of such
Defaulting Lender to the payment of each such Defaulted Amount to the extent
required to pay such Defaulted Amount. In the event that the Administrative
Agent shall so apply any such amount to the payment of any such Defaulted Amount
on any date, the amount so applied by the Administrative Agent shall constitute
for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents payment, to such
extent, of such Defaulted Amount on such date. Any such amount so applied by the
Administrative Agent shall be retained by the Administrative Agent or
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such other Lender Parties, ratably in
accordance with the respective portions of such Defaulted Amounts payable at
such time to the Administrative Agent and such other Lender Parties and, if the
amount of such payment made by such Borrower shall at such time be insufficient
to pay all Defaulted Amounts owing at such time to the Administrative Agent and
the other Lender Parties, in the following order of priority:

<Page>
                                       51

            (i) FIRST, to the Administrative Agent for any Defaulted Amount then
      owing to the Administrative Agent; and

            (ii) SECOND, to any other Lender Parties for any Defaulted Amounts
      then owing to such other Lender Parties, ratably in accordance with such
      respective Defaulted Amounts then owing to such other Lender Parties.

Any portion of such amount paid by such Borrower for the account of such
Defaulting Lender remaining, after giving effect to the amount applied by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this subsection (b), shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent as specified in subsection (c) of this Section 2.15.

            (c) In the event that, at any one time, (i) any Lender Party shall
be a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Defaulting Lender shall not owe a Defaulted
Advance or a Defaulted Amount and (iii) either Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender Party shall be required to pay or distribute any
amount hereunder or under any other Loan Document to or for the account of such
Defaulting Lender, then such Borrower or such other Lender Party shall pay such
amount to the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in escrow or the Administrative
Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hold in escrow
such amount otherwise held by it. Any funds held by the Administrative Agent in
escrow under this subsection (c) shall be deposited by the Administrative Agent
in an account with Citibank, in the name and under the control of the
Administrative Agent, but subject to the provisions of this subsection (c). The
terms applicable to such account, including the rate of interest payable with
respect to the credit balance of such account from time to time, shall be
Citibank's standard terms applicable to escrow accounts maintained with it. Any
interest credited to such account from time to time shall be held by the
Administrative Agent in escrow under, and applied by the Administrative Agent
from time to time in accordance with the provisions of, this subsection (c). The
Administrative Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
apply all funds so held in escrow from time to time to the extent necessary to
make any Advances required to be made by such Defaulting Lender and to pay any
amount payable by such Defaulting Lender hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party, as and when
such Advances or amounts are required to be made or paid and, if the amount so
held in escrow shall at any time be insufficient to make and pay all such
Advances and amounts required to be made or paid at such time, in the following
order of priority:

            (i) FIRST, to the Administrative Agent for any amount then due and
      payable by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;

            (ii) SECOND, to any other Lender Parties for any amount then due and
      payable by such Defaulting Lender to such other Lender Parties hereunder,
      ratably in accordance with such respective amounts then due and payable to
      such other Lender Parties; and

            (iii) THIRD, to such Borrower for any Advance then required to be
      made by such Defaulting Lender pursuant to a Commitment of such Defaulting
      Lender.

In the event that any Lender Party that is a Defaulting Lender shall, at any
time, cease to be a Defaulting Lender, any funds held by the Administrative
Agent in escrow at such time with respect to such Lender Party shall be
distributed by the Administrative Agent to such Lender Party and applied by such
Lender Party to the Obligations owing to such Lender Party at such time under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents ratably in accordance with the
respective amounts of such Obligations outstanding at such time.

            (d) The rights and remedies against a Defaulting Lender under this
Section 2.15 are in addition to other rights and remedies that either Borrower
may have against such Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Advance
and that the Administrative Agent or any Lender Party may have against such
Defaulting Lender with respect to any Defaulted Amount.

      laws.

      become misleading, incorrect or incomplete in any material respect, (ii)
      that, following the consummation of the Acquisition, either Borrower or
      its Subsidiaries would not have good and marketable title to all material

      respective Restricted Subsidiaries as they shall have reasonably

      transactions contemplated thereby.

            (j) The Administrative Agent shall have received the fees referred
      to in Section 2.08(c) to be received on the Closing Date and under a

      duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
      the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation, (ii) is duly qualified

      liability company or partnership (as applicable) action on the part of
      each Loan Party that is a party thereto, and do not (i) contravene such

      Subsidiaries or any of their properties or (iv) except for the Liens
      created under the Loan Documents, result in or require the creation or
      imposition of any Lien upon or with respect to any of the properties of
      any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (d) GOVERNMENTAL AND THIRD PARTY APPROVALS. Other than those that
      have already been obtained and as set forth in Schedule 4.01(d) and are in
      full force and effect, or as would not reasonably be expected to have a
      Material Adverse Effect, no authorization or approval (including, in the
      case of the Canadian Borrower, exchange control approval) or other action
      by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental authority or
      regulatory body or any other third party is required for (i) the due
      execution, delivery, recordation, filing or performance by any Loan Party
      of any Loan Document or any Related Document to which it is or is to be a
      party and (ii) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
      Loan Documents and the Related Documents.

            (e) DUE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY; BINDING OBLIGATION. Each of the Loan
      Documents has been duly executed and delivered by each Loan Party party
      thereto and is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party
      party thereto, enforceable against such Loan Party in accordance with its
      terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
      moratorium or similar law affecting creditor's rights generally or by
      general principles of equity.

      condition of such Borrower and its respective Subsidiaries as at such
      dates and the Consolidated results of the operations of such Borrower and
      its Subsidiaries for the periods ended on such dates, all in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent
      basis (unless otherwise expressly noted therein), and since December 31,
      2000, there has been no Material Adverse Change other than as a result of
      the current slow down in the North American trucking industry existing as
      of the date hereof.

      statements and cash flows statements of the U.S. Borrower and its

      Parties that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as

      AKW Information Memorandum nor any other information, exhibit or report

      Party in writing in connection with the negotiation of the Loan Documents
      or pursuant to the terms of the Loan Documents contained any untrue
      statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary

      engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing

      Margin Stock.

            (ii) Following application of the proceeds of each Advance or
      drawing under each Letter of Credit, not more than 25 percent of the value

      its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis) subject to the provisions of
      Section 5.02(a) or 5.02(d) or subject to any restriction contained in any
      agreement or instrument between either Borrower and any Lender Party or
      any Affiliate of any Lender Party relating to Debt and within the scope of
      Section 7.01(e) will be Margin Stock.

            (k) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND ERISA RELATED MATTERS. (i) Each Plan

      Requirement of Law; no Reportable Event has occurred (or is reasonably
      likely to occur) with respect to any Plan; no Plan is insolvent or in
      reorganization (or is reasonably likely to be insolvent or in
      reorganization), and no written notice of any such insolvency or
      reorganization has been given to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any ERISA
      Affiliate; no Plan (other than a multiemployer plan ) has an accumulated
      or waived funding deficiency (or is reasonably likely to have such a
      deficiency); neither any Loan Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred

      4201 or 4204 of ERISA or Section 4971 or 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code
      or has been notified in writing that it will incur any liability under any

<Page>
                                       64

      imposed under the Internal Revenue Code or ERISA on the assets of any Loan
      Party or any ERISA Affiliate exists on account of any Plan (or is
      reasonably likely to exist) nor has any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate
      been notified in writing that such a lien will be imposed on the assets of
      any Loan Party or any ERISA Affiliate on account of any Plan, EXCEPT to
      the extent that a breach of any of the foregoing representations and
      warranties in this Section 4.01(k)(i) would not result, individually or in
      the aggregate, in an amount of liability that would be reasonably likely
      to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Plan (other than a multiemployer
      plan) has an Unfunded Current Liability that would, individually or when
      taken together with any other liabilities referenced in this Section
      4.01(k)(i), be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. With
      respect to Plans that are multiemployer plans (as defined in Section 3(37)
      of ERISA), the representations and warranties in this Section 4.01(k)(i),
      other than any made with respect to (a) liability under Section 4201 or
      4204 of ERISA or (b) liability for termination or reorganization of such
      Plans under ERISA, are made to the best knowledge of the Borrowers.

      government other than the United States (a "FOREIGN GOVERNMENT SCHEME OR
      ARRANGEMENT") and with respect to each employee benefit plan maintained or
      contributed to by any Subsidiary of any Loan Party that is not subject to
      United States law (a "Foreign PLAN"), except as in the aggregate could not
      reasonably be expected to have Material Adverse Effect:

                  (A) Any employer and employee contributions required by law or
            by the terms of any Foreign Government Scheme or Arrangement or any
            Foreign Plan have been made, or if applicable, accrued, in
            accordance with normal accounting practices.

                  (B) The fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign
            Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded
            through insurance or the book reserve established for any Foreign
            Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to
            procure or provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the
            date hereof, with respect to all current and former participants in
            such Foreign Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
            valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to
            such Foreign Plan.

                  (C) Each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been
            registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
            regulatory authorities.

            (l) ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (i) Other than instances of
      non-compliance that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect: (A) the U.S. Borrower and its Subsidiaries are in
      compliance with all Environmental Laws and all Environmental Permits in
      all jurisdictions in which U.S. Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are
      currently doing business (including, without limitation having obtained
      all material Environmental Permits required under Environmental Laws) and
      (B) the U.S. Borrower will comply and cause each of their Subsidiaries to
      comply with all such Environmental Laws (including, without limitation,
      all Environmental Permits required under Environmental Laws).

            (ii) Neither U.S. Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has treated,
      stored, transported or disposed of Hazardous Materials at or from any
      currently or formerly owned real estate or facility relating to its
      business in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
      Adverse Effect.

      expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and except as disclosed in
      Schedule 4.01(l), all past non-compliance with

                                       65

      Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits has been resolved without
      ongoing obligations or costs, and no circumstances exist that could (A)
      form the basis of an Environmental Action against any Loan Party or any of
      its Subsidiaries or any of the properties described in the Mortgages that
      could have a Material Adverse Effect or (B) cause any such property to be
      subject to any restrictions on ownership, occupancy, current use or
      transferability under any Environmental Law.

            (iv) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.01(l), none of the properties
      currently or formerly owned or operated by any Loan Party or any of its

      adjacent to any such property.

            (v) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.01(l) and for events or
      conditions that could not reasonably be expected to result, either
      individually or in the aggregate, in a material liability to any Loan
      Party, (A) neither any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
      knowledge of any Loan Party, any other Person has owned or operated any
      underground or aboveground storage tanks or any surface impoundments,
      septic tanks, pits, sumps or lagoons in which Hazardous Materials are
      being or have been treated, stored or disposed on any property currently
      owned or operated by any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
      described in the Mortgages or, to the best of its knowledge, on any
      property formerly owned or operated by any Loan Party or any of its

      any property currently owned or operated by any Loan Party or any of its

      any of its Subsidiaries or described in the Mortgages; and (D) neither any
      Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of any Loan

      any of its Subsidiaries or described in any of the Mortgages.

            (vi) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.01(l) and for investigations,
      assessments or actions that could not reasonably be expected to result,
      either individually or in the aggregate, in a material liability to any
      Loan Party, neither any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the
      knowledge of any Loan Party, any other party, is undertaking, either
      individually or together with other potentially responsible parties, any
      investigation or assessment or remedial or response action relating to any
      actual or threatened release, discharge or disposal of material quantities

                           COVENANTS OF THE BORROWERS

            SECTION 5.01. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. So long as any Advance shall
remain unpaid, any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or any Lender Party
shall have any Commitment hereunder, each Borrower will:

            (a) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, ETC. Comply, and cause each of its
      Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable
      laws, rules, regulations and orders, such compliance to include, without
      limitation, compliance with ERISA, and the Racketeer Influenced and
      Corrupt Organizations Chapter of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,
      except such as may be contested in good faith or as to which a bona fide
      dispute may exist and except to the extent that noncompliance therewith
      could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) PAYMENT OF TAXES, ETC. Pay and discharge, and cause each of its
      Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, before the same shall become
      delinquent, (i) all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges
      or levies imposed upon it or upon its property prior to the date on which
      material penalties attach thereto, and (ii) all lawful material claims
      that, if unpaid, might by law become a material Lien upon the property of
      the U.S. Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries not otherwise expressly
      permitted under this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Borrower
      nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such
      tax, assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in good faith and
      by proper proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves (in the good
      faith judgment of its management) are being maintained in accordance with
      GAAP.

            (c) MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE. Maintain, and cause each of its
      Restricted Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance with responsible and
      reputable insurance companies or associations (at the time the relevant
      coverage is placed or renewed) in such amounts and covering such risks as
      is usually carried by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses
      and owning similar properties in the same general areas in which such
      Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary operates.

            (d) PRESERVATION OF CORPORATE, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AND
      PARTNERSHIP EXISTENCE, ETC. Preserve and maintain, and cause each of its
      Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its existence, legal structure,
      legal name, rights (charter and statutory), permits, licenses, approvals,
      privileges and franchises, except to the extent that failure to do so
      could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;
      PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that each Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries may
      consummate any merger or consolidation permitted under Section 5.02(c) and
      PROVIDED FURTHER that neither Borrower nor any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries shall be required to preserve any right, permit, license,
      approval, privilege or franchise if the Board of Directors of such
      Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary shall determine that the
      preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business
      of such Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, and

      development or expansion thereof or that are ancillary or reasonably
      related thereto.

            (f) VISITATION RIGHTS. At any reasonable time and from time to time,
      upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, permit any

      affairs, finances and accounts of such Borrower and any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries with any of their officers or directors and with their
      independent certified public accountants, PROVIDED that such Borrower may,
      if it so chooses, be present at or participate in any such discussion.

            (g) KEEPING OF BOOKS. Keep, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
      keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and correct

      practice, and will from time to time make or cause to be made all

      Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions otherwise permitted
      under the Loan Documents with any of their Affiliates on terms that are
      fair and reasonable and no less favorable to such Borrower or such

      between or among the Loan Parties and any Restricted Subsidiaries of the
      U.S. Borrower, (ii) payment of customary annual fees to KKR or its

      or to repay outstanding intercompany loans owed to the U.S. Borrower.

            (k) COVENANT TO GUARANTY OBLIGATIONS AND TO GIVE SECURITY. When (a)
      any new Restricted Subsidiary of the U.S. Borrower is formed, acquired or

                  Administrative Agent may have reasonably deemed necessary or
                  desirable in order to create valid first and subsisting Liens
                  on the Properties have been taken.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.01(n), for any of the
Properties in which the interest of the applicable Loan Party is a leasehold
interest and for which the consent of the landlord or other action by the
landlord is required in order for the applicable Loan Party to comply with the
provisions of this Section 5.01(n), the U.S. Borrower agrees to use, and to
cause each of the other Loan Parties to use, commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consent or cause the landlord to take such other action; however, if
after use of such commercially reasonable efforts, any landlord consent is not
obtained or any landlord does not take such other action, then the Loan Parties
shall not be required to deliver the applicable Mortgage, Mortgage Policies or
other items required hereunder or to undertake the applicable action.

            (o) COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. Comply, and cause each of
      its Subsidiaries and all lessees and other Persons operating or occupying
      its properties to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable
      Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits; obtain and renew and cause
      each of its Subsidiaries to obtain and renew all Environmental Permits
      necessary for its operations and properties; and conduct, and cause each
      of its Subsidiaries to conduct, any investigation, study, sampling and
      testing, and undertake any cleanup, removal, remedial or other action
      necessary to remove and clean up all Hazardous Materials from any of its
      properties, in accordance with the requirements of all Environmental Laws;
      PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither the U.S. Borrower nor any of its
      Subsidiaries shall be required to undertake any such cleanup, removal,
      remedial or other action to the extent that its obligation to do so is
      being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and appropriate
      reserves are being maintained with respect to such circumstances.

            (p) PREPARATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS. At the request of the
      Agent from time to time, provide to the Lender Parties within 60 days
      after such request, at the expense of the U.S. Borrower, an environmental
      site assessment report for any of its or its Subsidiaries' properties
      described in such request, prepared by an environmental consulting firm
      acceptable to the Administrative Agent, indicating the presence or absence
      of Hazardous Materials and the estimated cost of any compliance, removal
      or remedial action in connection with any Hazardous Materials on such
      properties; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the
      Administrative Agent determines at any time that a material risk exists
      that any such report will not be provided within the time referred to
      above, the Administrative Agent may retain an environmental consulting
      firm to prepare such report at the expense of the Borrower, and the U.S.
      Borrower hereby grants and agrees to cause any Subsidiary that owns any
      property described in such request to grant at the time of such request,
      to the Administrative Agent, the Lender Parties, such firm and any agents
      or representatives thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject
      to the rights of tenants, to enter onto its or their respective properties
      to undertake such an assessment.

            SECTION 5.02. NEGATIVE COVENANTS. So long as any Advance shall
remain unpaid, any Letter of Credit shall be outstanding or any Lender Party
shall have any Commitment hereunder, neither Borrower will, at any time:

            PROVIDED that such Liens were not created in contemplation of such
            merger, consolidation or investments and do not extend to any assets

                                   ARTICLE VI.

                                    GUARANTY

            SECTION 6.01. GUARANTY. The U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees (the provisions set forth in this Article VI being the
"GUARANTY") the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled maturity or at a
date fixed for prepayment or by acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all of the
Obligations of the Canadian Borrower now or hereafter existing under or in
respect of the Loan Documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or
contingent, and whether for principal, interest, fees, indemnification payments,
costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender Parties in enforcing any rights
under this Guaranty. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
liability of the U.S. Borrower shall extend to all amounts that constitute part
of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by the Canadian Borrower under
or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that such Guaranteed
Obligations are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a
bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving the Canadian
Borrower.

            SECTION 6.02. GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. (a) The U.S. Borrower guarantees
that all of the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents, regardless of any Requirements of Law now or
hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender Parties with
respect thereto. The Obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Guaranty are
independent of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of the
Canadian Borrower under or in respect of the Loan Documents, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the U.S. Borrower to
enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against the
Canadian Borrower or whether the Canadian Borrower is joined in any such action
or actions. The liability of the U.S. Borrower under this Guaranty shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable irrespective of, and the U.S. Borrower
hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or may hereafter acquire
in any way relating to, any and all of the following:

            (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any of the Loan
      Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto;

            (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
      any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
      Obligations of the Canadian Borrower under or in respect of the Loan
      Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
      from any of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any
      increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of
      additional credit to the Canadian Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
      otherwise);

            (iii) any taking, exchange, release or nonperfection of any of the
      Collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of, or consent
      to departure from, the Subsidiaries Guaranty or any other guarantee, for
      all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations;

            (iv) any manner of application of Collateral, or proceeds thereof,
      to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any manner of sale or
      other disposition of any Collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed
      Obligations or any other Obligations of the Canadian Borrower under or in
      respect of the Loan Documents, or any other property and assets of the
      Canadian Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

<Page>
                                       88

            (v) any change, restructuring or termination of the legal structure
      or existence of the Canadian Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries;

            (vi) any failure of any of the Lender Parties to disclose to the
      Canadian Borrower any information relating to the business, condition
      (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects
      of the Canadian Borrower now or hereafter known to such Lender Party;

            (vii) the failure of any other Person to execute the Subsidiaries
      Guaranty or any other guarantee or agreement or the release or reduction
      of liability of the Canadian Borrower or any other guarantor or surety
      with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or

            (viii) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
      statute of limitations or any existence of or reliance on any
      representation by the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender
      Parties) that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
      discharge of, the U.S. Borrower or any other guarantor or surety.

This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may
be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded
or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent or any of the other
Lender Parties or by any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Canadian Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment
had not been made, and the U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
agrees that it will indemnify the Administrative Agent and each of the other
Lender Parties, upon demand, for all of the costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such other Lender Party in connection with any such
rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in
defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference,
a fraudulent transfer or a similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar Requirements of Law.

            (e) The U.S. Borrower hereby further agrees that, as between the
U.S. Borrower, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lender
Parties, on the other hand, (i) the Guaranteed Obligations of the Canadian
Borrower may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section
7.01 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the
circumstances provided in Section 7.01) for purposes of this Guaranty,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration in respect of such Guaranteed Obligations (or preventing such
Guaranteed Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against
any other Person and (ii) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of
such Guaranteed Obligations (or such Guaranteed Obligations being deemed to have
become automatically due and payable) as provided in Section 7.01, such
Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable by the Canadian Borrower)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the U.S. Borrower for all purposes of
this Guaranty.

            SECTION 6.03. WAIVERS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. (a) The U.S. Borrower
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance,
default, protest, dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty, and any requirement that the
Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender Parties protect, secure, perfect
or insure any Lien or any property or assets subject thereto or exhaust any
right or take any action against the Canadian Borrower or any other Person or
any of the Collateral.

            (b) The U.S. Borrower hereby waives (i) any defense arising by
reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the
Administrative Agent or the other Lender Parties which in any manner impairs,
reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation,

                                       89

reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the U.S.
Borrower or any other rights of the U.S. Borrower to proceed against the
Canadian Borrower, any other guarantor or any other Person or any of the
Collateral, and (ii) any defense based on any right of setoff or counterclaim
against or in respect of the Obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this
Guaranty.

            (c) The U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
any duty on the part of the Administrative Agent or any of the other Lender
Parties to disclose to the U.S. Borrower any fact or other matter relating to
the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance,
properties or prospects of the Canadian Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
the property and assets thereof now or hereafter known by the Administrative
Agent or such other Lender Party.

            (d) The U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally waives any right to
revoke this Guaranty, and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in
nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the
future.

            (e) The U.S. Borrower hereby acknowledges that it will receive
substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements
contemplated by the Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth in Section
6.02 and in this Section 6.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

            SECTION 6.04. SUBROGATION. The U.S. Borrower hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or may
hereafter acquire against the Canadian Borrower or any other insider guarantor
that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the
Obligations of the U.S. Borrower under this Guaranty or any of the other Loan
Documents, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Administrative Agent or any of the
other Lender Parties against the Canadian Borrower or any other insider
guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises
in equity or under contract, statute, common law or any other Requirements of
Law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from such other
Loan Party or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or
other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until such time as all of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all of the other amounts payable under this Guaranty
shall have been paid in full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to the U.S.
Borrower in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to
the latest of the payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and all of the other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be
received and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
other Lender Parties, shall be segregated from the other property and funds of
the U.S. Borrower and shall be delivered forthwith to the Administrative Agent
in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment)
to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and the other amounts
payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents, or to be held as Collateral for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any of the other amounts payable under this Guaranty
thereafter arising. If (i) the U.S. Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations and (ii) all of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all of the other amounts payable under this Guaranty
shall have been paid in full in cash, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lender Parties will, at the U.S. Borrower's request and expense, execute and
deliver to the U.S. Borrower appropriate documents, without recourse and without
representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer of subrogation to
the U.S. Borrower of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from
the payment made by the U.S. Borrower under this Guaranty.

            SECTION 6.05. CONTINUING GUARANTY; ASSIGNMENTS. This Guaranty is a
continuing guarantee and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the
payment in full in cash of all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all of the
other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the U.S. Borrower
and its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the Administrative Agent and the other Lender Parties and their
respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the generality
of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, any of the Lender Parties
may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any
portion of its Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note
or Notes held by it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon
become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Lender
under this Article VI or otherwise, in each case as provided in Section 9.07.

      pursuant to Section 2.08, or any other amounts owing by it under any Loan
      Document, in each case within five days after the due date thereof; or

            (b) any representation or warranty made by any Loan Party in any
      Loan Document or any certificate delivered or required to be delivered
      pursuant thereto shall prove to have been untrue in any material respect
      on the date as of which made or deemed made; or

            (c) either Borrower shall default in the due performance or
      observance by it of any term, covenant or agreement required to be

      5.04; or

            (d) any Loan Party shall default in the due performance or
      observance by it of any other term, covenant or agreement contained in any
      Loan Document on its part to be performed or observed if such failure

      the applicable grace period, if any, specified in the agreement or
      instrument relating to such Debt; or any other event shall occur or
      condition shall exist under any agreement or instrument relating to any
      such Debt and shall continue after the applicable grace period, if any,
      specified in such agreement or instrument, if the effect of such event or
      condition is to accelerate, or to permit the acceleration of, the maturity
      of such Debt or otherwise to cause, or to permit the holder thereof to
      cause, such Debt to mature; or any such Debt shall be declared to be due
      and payable or required to be prepaid or redeemed (other than by a

      an order for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, or other
      similar official for it or for any substantial part of its property and,
      in the case of any such proceeding instituted against it (but not
      instituted by it) that is being diligently contested by it in good faith,
      either such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period
      of 60 days or any of the actions sought in such proceeding (including,
      without limitation, the entry of an order for relief against, or the
      appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official
      for, it or any substantial part of its property) shall occur; or any Loan
      Party or any of its Subsidiaries shall take any corporate action to
      authorize any of the actions set forth above in this subsection (f); or

            (g) one or more judgments or decrees shall be entered against either
      Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries involving a liability of
      $20,000,000 or more in the aggregate for all such judgments and decrees
      for the Borrowers and their Restricted Subsidiaries (to the extent not
      paid or fully covered by insurance provided by a carrier not disputing
      coverage) and any such judgments or decrees shall not have been satisfied,
      vacated, discharged or stayed or bonded pending appeal within 60 days from
      the entry thereof; or

            (h) any provision of any Loan Document after delivery thereof

            (i) any Collateral Document after delivery thereof pursuant to
      Section 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 or 5.01(k) shall for any reason (other than
      pursuant to the terms thereof) cease to create a valid and perfected first
      priority lien on and security interest in the Collateral purported to be
      covered thereby; or

            (j) any Change of Control shall occur; or

            (k) (i) Any Plan shall fail to satisfy the minimum funding standard
      required for any plan year or part thereof or a waiver of such standard or
      extension of any amortization period is sought or granted under Section
      412 of the Internal Revenue Code; any Plan is or shall have been
      terminated or is the subject of termination proceedings under ERISA
      (including the giving of written notice thereof); an event shall have
      occurred or a condition shall exist in either case entitling the PBGC to
      terminate any Plan or to appoint a trustee to administer any Plan
      (including the giving of written notice thereof); any Plan shall have an
      accumulated funding deficiency (whether or not waived); or any Loan Party

      incurring a lien, security interest or liability; and (iii) such lien,

                                       92

      then, and in any such event, the Administrative Agent (i) shall at the

      Issuing Bank or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and
      Swing Line Advances by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section
      2.02(b)) and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit to be
      terminated, whereupon the same shall forthwith terminate, and (ii) shall
      at the request, or may with the consent, of the Majority Lenders, (A) by
      notice to the Appropriate Borrower, declare the Notes, all interest
      thereon and all other amounts payable under this Agreement and the other
      Loan Documents to be forthwith due and payable, whereupon the Notes, all
      such interest and all such amounts shall become and be forthwith due and
      payable, without presentment, demand, protest or further notice of any
      kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by each Borrower and (B) by
      notice to each party required under the terms of any agreement in support
      of which a Standby Letter of Credit is issued, request that all
      Obligations under such agreement be declared to be due and payable;
      PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event of an actual or deemed entry of an
      order for relief with respect to any Loan Party or any of its Restricted
      Subsidiaries under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, (x) the obligation of each
      Lender to make Advances (other than Letter of Credit Advances by the
      Issuing Bank or a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section 2.03(c) and
      Swing Line Advances by a Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to Section
      2.02(b)) and of the Issuing Bank to issue Letters of Credit shall
      automatically be terminated and (y) the Notes, all such interest and all
      such amounts shall automatically become and be due and payable, without
      presentment, demand, protest or any notice of any kind, all of which are
      hereby expressly waived by each Borrower.


                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

            SECTION 8.01. AUTHORIZATION AND ACTION. Each Lender Party (in its
capacities as a Lender, the Swing Line Bank (if applicable), the Issuing Bank
(if applicable) and a potential Hedge Bank) hereby appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.
As to any matters not expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, enforcement or collection of the Notes), the Administrative
Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but
shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected
in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Majority
Lenders, and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lender Parties and all
holders of Notes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Administrative Agent shall not be
required to take any action that exposes the Administrative Agent to personal
liability or that is contrary to this Agreement or applicable law. The
Administrative Agent agrees to give to each Lender Party prompt notice of each
notice given to it by either Borrower pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

            SECTION 8.02. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S RELIANCE, ETC. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees
shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them under
or in connection with the Loan Documents, except for its or their own gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the generality of the
foregoing, the Administrative Agent: (a) may treat the payee of any Note as the
holder thereof until the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an Assignment
and Acceptance entered into by the Lender that is the payee of such Note, as
assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, as provided in Section 9.07;
(b) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel for any Loan Party),
independent public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be
liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in
accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (c) makes no
warranty or

<Page>
                                       93

representation to any Lender Party and shall not be responsible to any Lender
Party for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or
oral) made in or in connection with the Loan Documents; (d) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of any Loan Document on the part of any Loan
Party or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any Loan
Party; (e) shall not be responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the
perfection or priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to
be created under or in connection with, any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; and (f) shall incur no
liability under or in respect of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice,
consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by telegram,
telecopy or telex) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper
party or parties.

            SECTION 8.03. CITICORP AND AFFILIATES. With respect to its
Commitments, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it, Citicorp shall
have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any other Lender
Party and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent;
and the term "Lender Party" or "Lender Parties" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated, include Citicorp in its individual capacity. Citicorp and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, accept investment banking engagements from and generally engage
in any kind of business with, any Loan Party, any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person who may do business with or own securities of any Loan Party or any such
Subsidiary, all as if Citicorp were not the Administrative Agent and without any
duty to account therefor to the Lender Parties.

            SECTION 8.04. LENDER PARTY CREDIT DECISION. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender Party and based on the financial
statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter
into this Agreement. Each Lender Party also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender Party and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement.

            SECTION 8.05. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Each Lender Party severally
agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not promptly
reimbursed by the Borrowers) from and against such Lender Party's ratable share
(determined as provided below) of any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or
asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out
of the Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent
under the Loan Documents; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Lender Party shall be
liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting
from the Administrative Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party agrees to reimburse the
Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any costs and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) payable by the Borrowers under Section 9.04, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent is not promptly reimbursed for such costs and expenses by
the Borrowers. For purposes of this Section 8.05(a), the Lender Parties'
respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at any time,
according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Advances
outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender Parties, (ii) their
respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available LC Amount of all Letters
of Credit outstanding at such time, (iii) the aggregate unused portions of their
respective Term A Commitments, Term B Commitments and Term C Commitments at such
time and (iv) their respective Unused Revolving Credit Commitments at such time;
PROVIDED that the aggregate principal amount of Swing Line Advances owing to the
Swing Line Bank and

<Page>
                                       94

of Letter of Credit Advances owing to the Issuing Bank shall be considered to be
owed to the Revolving Credit Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective
Revolving Credit Commitments. In the event that any Defaulted Advance shall be
owing by any Defaulting Lender at any time, such Lender Party's Commitment with
respect to the Facility under which such Defaulted Advance was required to have
been made shall be considered to be unused for purposes of this Section 8.05(a)
to the extent of the amount of such Defaulted Advance. The failure of any Lender
Party to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable
share of any amount required to be paid by the Lender Party to the
Administrative Agent as provided herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party
of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its
ratable share of such amount, but no Lender Party shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender Party to reimburse the Administrative Agent for such
other Lender Party's ratable share of such amount. Without prejudice to the
survival of any other agreement of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement and
obligations of each Lender Party contained in this Section 8.05(a) shall survive
the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

            (b) Each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees to indemnify the
Issuing Bank (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Borrowers) from and
against such Lender Party's ratable share (determined as provided below) of any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Issuing
Bank in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any action
taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no Lender Party shall be liable for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Issuing Bank's gross
negligence or willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each such
Lender Party agrees to reimburse the Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its
ratable share of any costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) payable by the Borrowers under Section
9.04, to the extent that the Issuing Bank is not promptly reimbursed for such
costs and expenses by the Borrowers. For purposes of this Section 8.05(b), the
Lender Parties' respective ratable shares of any amount shall be determined, at
any time, according to the sum of (i) the aggregate principal amount of the
Advances outstanding at such time and owing to the respective Lender Parties,
(ii) their respective Pro Rata Shares of the aggregate Available LC Amount of
all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time, (iii) the aggregate unused
portions of their respective Term A Commitments, Term B Commitments and Term C
Commitments at such time PLUS (iv) their respective Unused Revolving Credit
Commitments at such time; PROVIDED that the aggregate principal amount of Swing
Line Advances owing to the Swing Line Bank and of Letter of Credit Advances
owing to the Issuing Bank shall be considered to be owed to the Revolving Credit
Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit
Commitments. In the event that any Defaulted Advance shall be owing by any
Defaulting Lender at any time, such Lender Party's Commitment with respect to
the Facility under which such Defaulted Advance was required to have been made
shall be considered to be unused for purposes of this Section 8.05(b) to the
extent of the amount of such Defaulted Advance. The failure of any Lender Party
to reimburse the Issuing Bank promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any
amount required to be paid by the Lender Parties to the Issuing Bank as provided
herein shall not relieve any other Lender Party of its obligation hereunder to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for its ratable share of such amount, but no Lender
Party shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender Party to
reimburse the Issuing Bank for such other Lender Party's ratable share of such
amount. Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any Lender
Party hereunder, the agreement and obligations of each Lender Party contained in
this Section 8.05(b) shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest
and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 8.06. SUCCESSOR ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS. The Administrative
Agent may resign as to any or all of the Facilities at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lender Parties

<Page>
                                       95

and the Borrowers and may be removed as to all of the Facilities at any time
with or without cause by the Majority Lenders. Upon any such resignation or
removal, the Majority Lenders shall, with the consent of the U.S. Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) have the right to appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as to such of the Facilities as to which the
Administrative Agent has resigned or been removed. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and
consented to by the U.S. Borrower, and shall have accepted such appointment,
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Majority Lenders' removal of the retiring Administrative
Agent, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lender
Parties and with the consent of the U.S. Borrower (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) appoint a successor Administrative Agent,
which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States
or of any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent as to all of the Facilities and
upon the execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or
amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary
or desirable, or as the Majority Lenders may request, in order to continue the
perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral
Documents, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor
Administrative Agent as to less than all of the Facilities and upon the
execution and filing or recording of such financing statements, or amendments
thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary or
desirable, or as the Majority Lenders may request, in order to continue the
perfection of the Liens granted or purported to be granted by the Collateral
Documents, such successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent as to such Facilities, other than with respect to
funds transfers and other similar aspects of the administration of Borrowings
under such Facilities, issuances of Letters of Credit (notwithstanding any
resignation as Administrative Agent with respect to the Letter of Credit
Facility) and payments by the Borrowers in respect of such Facilities, and the
retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations under this Agreement as to such Facilities, other than as aforesaid.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as
Administrative Agent as to all of the Facilities, the provisions of this Article
VIII shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent as to any Facilities under this
Agreement.

            SECTION 8.07. ARRANGER, SYNDICATION AGENT AND DOCUMENTATION AGENT.
The Arranger (both as defined herein and as defined in the Original Credit

<Page>
                                       97

shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any remedies provided by law.

            SECTION 9.04. COSTS, EXPENSES. (a) Each Borrower agrees to pay on
demand (i) all costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent in connection with
the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment
of the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, (A) all due diligence,
collateral review, syndication, transportation, computer, duplication,
appraisal, audit, insurance, consultant, search, filing and recording fees and
expenses and (B) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the
Administrative Agent with respect thereto, with respect to advising the
Administrative Agent as to its rights and responsibilities, or the perfection,
protection or preservation of rights or interests, under the Loan Documents,
with respect to negotiations with any Loan Party or with other creditors of any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of any Default or any events
or circumstances that may give rise to a Default and with respect to presenting
claims in or otherwise participating in or monitoring any bankruptcy, insolvency
or other similar proceeding involving creditors' rights generally and any
proceeding ancillary thereto) and (ii) all costs and expenses of the
Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties in connection with the enforcement
of the Loan Documents, whether in any action, suit or litigation, any
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding affecting creditors' rights
generally (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Administrative Agent and each Lender Party with respect
thereto).

            (b) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Administrative Agent, each Lender Party and each of their Affiliates and their
officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED
PARTY") from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and
expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified
Party, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of
(including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation
or proceeding or preparation of a defense in connection therewith) (i) the
Facilities, any real property owned by, leased by or leased to any Loan Party,
the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances or the Letters of
Credit, the Loan Documents or any of the transactions contemplated thereby,
including, without limitation, any acquisition or proposed acquisition
(including, without limitation, the Acquisition, the AKW Acquisition and any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby) by the Investor Group or any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates of all or any portion of the stock or
substantially all the assets of such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii)
the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of any
Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Action relating in
any way to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent, in
each case, such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense is found in a final,
non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In the
case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the indemnity
in this Section 9.04(b) applies, such indemnity shall be effective whether or
not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Loan Party,
its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnified Party or any
Indemnified Party is otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated.

            (c) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by either Borrower to or for the account of a Lender Party
other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result
of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09(b)(i) or 2.10(c),
acceleration of the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 7.01 or for any
other reason, such Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy
of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party any amounts required to compensate such Lender
Party for any additional losses, costs or expenses that it may reasonably incur
as a result of such payment, including, without limitation, any loss (including
loss of anticipated profits),

<Page>
                                       98

cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds acquired by any Lender Party to fund or maintain such
Advance.

            (d) If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or
other amounts payable by it under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel and indemnities, such amount may be
paid on behalf of such Loan Party by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
Party, in its sole discretion.

            (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of any
Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, the agreements and
obligations of the Borrowers contained in Sections 2.10 and 2.12 and this
Section 9.04 shall survive the payment in full of principal, interest and all
other amounts payable hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 9.05. RIGHT OF SET-OFF. Upon (a) the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default and (b) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 7.01 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare the Notes due and payable pursuant to the
provisions of Section 7.01, each Lender Party and each of its respective
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and otherwise apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender Party or such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of either Borrower against any and
all of the Obligations of such Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement and the Note or Notes (if any) held by such Lender Party, irrespective
of whether such Lender Party shall have made any demand under this Agreement or
such Note or Notes and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Lender
Party agrees promptly to notify such Borrower after any such set-off and
application; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender
Party and its respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off)
that such Lender Party and its respective Affiliates may have.

            SECTION 9.06. BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement shall become effective
when it shall have been executed by each Borrower and the Administrative Agent
and when the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by each Initial
Lender and the Initial Issuing Bank that such Initial Lender and the Initial
Issuing Bank has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Lender Party and
their respective successors and assigns, except that neither Borrower shall have
the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Lender Parties.

            SECTION 9.07. ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS. (a) Each Lender may,
with the consent of the Administrative Agent, and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Appropriate
Borrower (in each case, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), assign to
one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitment or Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held
by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no consent by either Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to any Person who is an
Affiliate of such Lender, and PROVIDED FURTHER that (i) each such assignment
shall be of a uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and
obligations under and in respect of one or more Facilities, (ii) except in the
case of an assignment to a Person that, immediately prior to such assignment,
was a Lender or an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement or all of a Lender's rights and obligations with respect to its
Term B Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being
assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of the
Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event be
less than $5,000,000

<Page>
                                       99

(or integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof), (iii) each such
assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (vi) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with any Note or Notes subject to such assignment and, other than in the case of
an assignment to an Affiliate of such Lender, a processing and recordation fee
of $3,000; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing processing and recordation fee
for any assignment made pursuant to this Section 9.07 on or prior to March 31,
1998 which is, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, associated with the
original syndication of the Facilities, will be waived.

            (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from
and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Acceptance, (x)
the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender or Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, hereunder and (y) the Lender or Issuing Bank assignor
thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights
and be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of
an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an
assigning Lender's or Issuing Bank's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender or Issuing Bank shall cease to be a party hereto).

            (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the
Lender Party assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and
agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of, or the perfection or
priority of any lien or security interest created or purported to be created
under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (ii) such
assigning Lender Party makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of either Borrower or any
other Loan Party or the performance or observance by any Loan Party of any of
its obligations under any Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a
copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements
referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, such assigning Lender Party or
any other Lender Party and based on such documents and information as it shall
deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms
that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise
such powers and discretion under the Loan Documents as are delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers and
discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which
by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender or
Issuing Bank, as the case may be.

            (d) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose (but only for
this purpose) as the agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 9.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered
to and accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lender Parties and the Commitment under each Facility of, and
principal amount of the Advances owing under each Facility to, each Lender Party
from time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the

<Page>
                                      100

Register as a Lender Party hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender Party
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

            (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender Party and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Acceptance has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C
hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information
contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the
Appropriate Borrower. In the case of any assignment by a Lender, within five
Business Days after its receipt of such notice, the Appropriate Borrower, at its
own expense, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange
for the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note to the order of such Eligible
Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it under a Facility
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has
retained a Commitment hereunder under such Facility, a new Note to the order of
the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it
hereunder. Such new Note or Notes shall be in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall
be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and shall
otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1, A-2, A-3 or A-4 hereto,
as the case may be.

            (f) The Issuing Bank may, with the consent of the Administrative
Agent, and, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, with the consent of the U.S. Borrower (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), assign to an Eligible Assignee all of its rights and
obligations under the undrawn portion of its Letter of Credit Commitment at any
time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible
Assignee and (ii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver
to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register,
an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,000.

            (g) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more Persons
(other than any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and
the Note or Notes (if any) held by it); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) such Lender
Party's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, its Commitments) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations, (iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such
Note for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Administrative
Agent and the other Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly
with such Lender Party in connection with such Lender Party's rights and
obligations under this Agreement, (v) no participant under any such
participation shall have any right to approve any amendment or waiver of any
provision of any Loan Document, or any consent to any departure by any Loan
Party therefrom, except to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent
would reduce the principal of, or interest (other than increased interest
following Default pursuant to Section 2.07(b)) on, the Notes or any fees or
other amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, postpone any Termination Date, or date fixed for payment of
interest on, the Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, in each
case to the extent subject to such participation, or release the U.S. Borrower
from its Obligations under Article VI hereof, or all or substantially all of the
Collateral, and (vi) neither Borrower shall be subject to any increased
liability to any Lender Party pursuant to this Agreement by virtue of such
participation.

            (h) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
9.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrowers furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrowers; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, prior to any
such disclosure, the assignee

<Page>
                                      101

or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the
confidentiality of any Confidential Information received by it from such Lender
Party.

            (i) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement,
any Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of any Federal
Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System.

            SECTION 9.08. REPLACEMENTS OF LENDERS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.
The U.S. Borrower shall be permitted to replace any Lender that (a) requests
reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to Section 2.10 or 2.12, (b) is
affected in the manner described in Section 2.10(c) and as a result thereof any
of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken or (c) becomes
a Defaulting Lender, with a replacement bank or other financial institution,
PROVIDED that (i) such replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of
Law, (ii) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time
of such replacement, (iii) the Appropriate Borrower shall repay (or the
replacement bank or institution shall purchase, at par) all Loans and other
amounts (other than any disputed amounts), pursuant to Section 2.10, 2.11 or
2.12, as the case may be) owing to such replaced Lender prior to the date of
replacement, (iv) the replacement bank or institution, if not already a Lender,
and the terms and conditions of such replacement, shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (v) the replaced Lender shall be
obligated to make such replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section
9.07 (provided that such Borrower shall be obligated to pay the registration and
processing fee referred to therein) and (vi) any such replacement shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any rights that either Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender Party shall have against the replaced Lender.

            SECTION 9.09. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this
Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.10. NO LIABILITY OF THE ISSUING BANK. The U.S. Borrower
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of
any Letter of Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit. Neither
the Issuing Bank nor any of its officers or directors shall be liable or
responsible for: (a) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or any
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection therewith; (b)
the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects
invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (c) payment by the Issuing Bank
against presentation of documents that do not comply with the terms of a Letter
of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any reference or adequate
reference to the Letter of Credit; or (d) any other circumstances whatsoever in
making or failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit, EXCEPT that the
U.S. Borrower shall have a claim against the Issuing Bank, and the Issuing Bank
shall be liable to the U.S. Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but not
consequential, damages suffered by the U.S. Borrower that the U.S. Borrower
proves were caused by (i) the Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross
negligence in determining whether documents presented under any Letter of Credit
comply with the terms of the Letter of Credit or (ii) the Issuing Bank's willful
failure to make lawful payment under a Letter of Credit after the presentation
to it of a draft and certificates strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of the Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Issuing Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be
in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary.

                                      102

            SECTION 9.11. CONFIDENTIALITY. The Administrative Agent and each
Lender shall hold all non-public information furnished by or on behalf of either
Borrower in connection with such Lender's evaluation of whether to become a
Lender hereunder or obtained by such Lender or the Administrative Agent pursuant
to the requirements of this Agreement ("CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION"), in
accordance with its customary procedure for handling confidential information of
this nature and (in the case of a Lender that is a bank) in accordance with safe
and sound banking practices. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender
Party shall disclose any Confidential Information to any Person without the
consent of the Borrowers, other than (a) to the Administrative Agent's or such
Lender Party's Affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, agents and
advisors and to actual or prospective Eligible Assignees and participants, and
then only on a confidential basis, (b) as required by any law, rule or
regulation or judicial process and (c) as requested or required by any state,
federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating such Lender Party or the
Administrative Agent.

transfer or other disposition of any item of Collateral of any Loan Party
(including, without limitation, as a result of the sale, in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents, of the Loan Party that owns such Collateral) in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent will,
at the U.S. Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to such Loan Party such
documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of
such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under
the Collateral Documents in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.

            (b) Upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of all of
the capital stock of any Loan Party that is Subsidiary Guarantor in accordance
with the terms of the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent will, at the U.S.
Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to such Loan Party such documents as
such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence its release as a Subsidiary
Guarantor from its Obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents.

            SECTION 9.13. JURISDICTION, ETC. (a) Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to
the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or federal court of
the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to which it is a party, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State
court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal court. Each Borrower
irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any such action or
proceeding by the mailing of copies of such process by registered or certified
mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such
Borrower at its address specified in Section 9.02 and agrees that nothing herein
shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other manner
permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other jurisdiction. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State or federal
court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance
of such action or proceeding in any such court.

            SECTION 9.14. JUDGMENT. (a) If for the purposes of obtaining
judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under
any of the other Loan Documents in U.S. dollars into another currency, the
parties hereto agree, to the fullest extent that they may effectively do so,
that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal
banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase U.S. dollars with
such other currency at Citibank on the Business Day preceding that on which
final judgment is given.

            (b) The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any sum due from
it to any Lender Party or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any of the
other Loan Documents held by such Lender Party shall, notwithstanding any
judgment in a currency other than U.S. dollars, be discharged only to the extent
that on the Business Day of receipt by such Lender Party or the Administrative
Agent (as the case may be) of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other
currency such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) may
in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase U.S. dollars with such
other currency; if the U.S. dollars so purchased are less than the sum
originally due by such Borrower to such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent
(as the case may be) in U.S. dollars, such Borrower agrees, as a separate
obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender Party
or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the
U.S. dollars so purchased exceed the sum originally due by such Borrower to any
Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) in U.S. dollars,
such Lender Party or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) agrees to
remit to such Borrower such excess.

            SECTION 9.15. REFERENCE TO AND EFFECT ON THE LOAN DOCUMENTS. Each
Borrower hereby confirms and agrees that each of the Term A Notes, the Term B
Notes, Term C Notes and the Revolving Credit Notes, to the extent each is
outstanding as of the date hereof, is, and shall continue to be, in full force
and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects, except that,
upon the effectiveness of this Agreement and on and after the date hereof, each
reference in such Notes to the "Credit Agreement", "thereunder", "thereof",
"therein" or words of like import referring to the Original Credit Agreement
shall mean and be a reference to this Agreement.

            SECTION 9. 16. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the Notes shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York, United States.

            SECTION 9.17. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. Each of the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties irrevocably waives all right to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to any of the Loan
Documents, the Advances or the actions of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
Party in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.

operating condition, consistent with past practices, and will promptly make all
appropriate repairs, restorations, renewals, replacements, additions and

be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) STATUS OF THE PREMISES. The Premises is not located in an area
identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or a successor
thereto as an area having special flood hazards pursuant to the terms of the

business as in effect as of the date hereof and for no other use unless
consented to in writing by Mortgagee. Mortgagor will not do or suffer to be done
anything which would or which could increase the risk of fire or other hazard to
the Premises or any other part thereof or which would or could result in
cancellation of any insurance policy carried with respect to the Premises.

            (d) REMOVAL OF IMPROVEMENTS. Mortgagor will not remove any
Improvements except in the ordinary course of business from the Premises or
remove, demolish or alter, other than an alteration of an immaterial nature, the
structural character of any Improvements without the written consent of
Mortgagee, nor use or permit use of the Premises for any purpose other than that
for which the same are now used.

            (e) DAMAGE. If the Premises or any part thereof are damaged by fire

written notice to Mortgagee, (i) initiate or support any zoning reclassification

ordinances, (ii) modify or amend any of the Permitted Encumbrances except to the

<Page>

            SECTION 3.05. Insurance. (a) COVERAGE. Mortgagor shall maintain (i)
casualty insurance insuring the Improvements now or hereafter constituting a
part of the Mortgaged Property against damage by fire and the other hazards
covered by a standard all-risk, extended coverage insurance policy for the full
insurable value thereof (which, unless Mortgagee shall otherwise agree in
writing, shall mean the full repair and replacement value thereof without
reduction for depreciation or co-insurance), and (ii) Commercial General
Liability Insurance in respect of the operation of the Mortgaged Property as
required by the Loan Documents. In addition, Mortgagee may require Mortgagor to
carry such other insurance on the Mortgaged Property in such amounts as may from
time to time reasonably be generally required by institutional lenders.

            (b) POLICY REQUIREMENTS. All liability insurance policies required
pursuant to Section 3.05(a) shall name Mortgagee as an additional insured
thereunder, and all other insurance policies required pursuant to Section
3.05(a), to the extent reasonably possible, or otherwise maintained by Mortgagor
shall name Mortgagee as the mortgagee under New York long form non-contributory
endorsements. All such insurance policies and endorsements shall be fully paid
or paid pursuant to an installment program offered to Mortgagor by the insurer
or its broker/agent, provided that the installments are paid on or before the
due date thereof so that all required insurance coverage is maintained without
interruption. All insurance policies required to be maintained by Mortgagor
shall contain such provisions and expiration dates, and be in such form and
issued by such insurance companies qualified and licensed to do business in the
jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is located, as may be reasonably
acceptable to Mortgagee. All insurance companies issuing insurance for the
Mortgaged Property on behalf of the Mortgagor shall have a Best Insurance Guide
Rating of A/XI or better. Any coverage required to be maintained pursuant to
this Section may be maintained under a blanket insurance policy provided such
policy otherwise satisfies the requirements of this Section. Each policy
required to be maintained by Mortgagor shall provide that such policy may not be
cancelled or materially changed except upon not less than thirty (30) days'
prior written notice to Mortgagee of the intention of non-renewal, cancellation
or material change and that no act or thing done by Mortgagor shall invalidate
the policy as against Mortgagee. In the event Mortgagor fails to maintain
insurance in compliance with Section 3.05(a) or, in the event that a notice of
non-renewal, cancellation or material change is given to Mortgagee, as
aforesaid, and within ten (10) days after the delivery of such notice Mortgagor
shall fail to deliver to Mortgagee evidence of the purchase of a substitute
policy of insurance or a renewal of the existing policy of insurance, Mortgagee
may, after ten (10) days' notice to Mortgagor (or, if the policy in question
shall sooner expire or be terminated, on or after the day before the date of
such expiration or termination) but shall not be obligated to, obtain such
insurance and pay the premium therefor and Mortgagor shall, on demand, reimburse
Mortgagee for all sums, advances and reasonable expenses incurred in connection
therewith, together with interest thereon at the rate of interest applicable
under the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of a Default (the "DEFAULT RATE")
from the date such amounts are advanced until the same are paid to Mortgagee.

            (c) NO SEPARATE INSURANCE. Mortgagor shall not carry separate or
additional insurance concurrent in form or contributing, in the event of loss,
with that required hereunder unless endorsed in favor of Mortgagee as loss payee
or additional insured, as applicable, and otherwise acceptable to Mortgagee in
all respects.

            (d) TRANSFER OF TITLE. In the event of foreclosure of this Mortgage
or other transfer of title or assignment of the Premises in extinguishment, in
whole or in part, of the Secured Obligations, all right, title and interest of
Mortgagor in and to all policies of insurance required under this Section or
otherwise then in force with respect to the Premises and all proceeds payable
thereunder and unearned premiums thereon shall immediately vest in the purchaser
or other transferee of the Premises.

<Page>

            (e) DELIVERY OF POLICIES. Mortgagor covenants that it has delivered
to Mortgagee, and shall, from time to time as may be requested by Mortgagee,
deliver to Mortgagee policies of insurance, or certificates thereof, that may be
reasonably requested by Mortgagee to confirm that the insurance required under
the terms of the Loan Documents is in place and in full force and effect.

            SECTION 3.06. Liens and Liabilities. (a) DISCHARGE OF LIENS.
Mortgagor will pay, bond or otherwise discharge, from time to time when the same
shall become due, all claims and demands of mechanics, materialmen, laborers and
others which, if unpaid, might result in, or permit the creation of, a lien on
the Premises.

            (b) CREATION OF LIENS. Mortgagor will not, without Mortgagee's
consent, create, place or permit to be created or placed or allow to remain, and
shall discharge and release within 10 days of the placing thereof, any deed of
trust, mortgage, trust deed, voluntary or involuntary lien, security interest or
other encumbrance against or covering the Premises, other than (i) Permitted
Encumbrances, (ii) Permitted Liens, (iii) and such deed of trusts, mortgages,
trust deeds, voluntary or involuntary liens, security interests or other
encumbrances against the Premises being contested in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.06(a), whether or not subordinate hereto.

            (c) NO CONSENT. Nothing in this Mortgage shall be deemed or
construed in any way as constituting the consent or request by Mortgagee,
express or implied, to any contractor, subcontractor, laborer, mechanic or
materialman for the performance of any labor or the furnishing of any material
for any improvement, construction, alteration or repair of the Premises.
Mortgagor further agrees that Mortgagee does not stand in any fiduciary
relationship to Mortgagor.

            SECTION 3.07. Taxes and Other Charges. (a) TAXES ON THE PREMISES.
Mortgagor will promptly pay when due and before any penalty or interest may be
added thereto, all Impositions, as provided in Section 5.01(b) of the Credit
Agreement. Mortgagor will also pay any penalty, interest or cost for non-payment
of Impositions which may become due and payable.

            (b) INCREASED COSTS. In the event of the enactment after the date
hereof of any law in the state in which the Mortgaged Property is located or any
other governmental entity deducting from the value of the Mortgaged Property for
the purpose of taxation any lien or security interest thereon, or changing in
any way the laws for the taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust or other liens or
debts secured thereby, or the manner of collection of such taxes, so as to
affect this Mortgage, the Secured Obligations, Mortgagee or the holders of the
Secured Obligations, then, and in such event, Mortgagor shall, on demand, pay to
Mortgagee or such holder, or reimburse Mortgagee or such holder for payment of,
all taxes, assessments, charges or liens for which Mortgagee or such holder is
or may be liable as a result thereof, provided that if any such payment or
reimbursement shall be unlawful or would constitute usury or render the Secured
Obligations wholly or partially usurious under applicable law, then Mortgagee
may, at its option, declare the Secured Obligations immediately due and payable
or require Mortgagor to pay or reimburse Mortgagee for payment of the lawful and
non-usurious portion thereof. Anything in this Mortgage to the contrary
notwithstanding, to the extent any demand under this Section 3.07(b) is given by
the Mortgagee or other holder more than 180 days after such Mortgagee or other
holder of the Secured Obligations has knowledge (or should have had knowledge)
of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the tax or other additional
amounts described in this Section 3.07(b), such Mortgagee or other holder of the
Secured Obligations shall not be entitled to compensation under this Section for
any such amounts incurred or accruing prior to the giving of such notice to the
Mortgagor.

            SECTION 3.08. Damage and Destruction. (a) MORTGAGOR'S OBLIGATIONS.
In the event of any damage to or loss or destruction of the Premises, Mortgagor
shall (i) promptly notify Mortgagee of such event, if such event would give rise
to a claim under the insurance policies required to be maintained

<Page>

by Mortgagor pursuant to Section 3.05 and (ii) take such steps as shall be
necessary to preserve any undamaged portion of the Premises.

            (b) MORTGAGEE'S RIGHTS; APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. In the event that
any portion of the Premises is so damaged, destroyed or lost, and such damage,
destruction or loss is covered, in whole or in part, by insurance required by
Section 3.05, then (i) Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Mortgagor and, if no no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, is hereby authorized and empowered by Mortgagor to
settle, adjust or compromise any claims for damage, destruction or loss
thereunder, (ii) except as provided in Section 3.08(a), each insurance company
concerned is hereby authorized and directed to make payment therefor directly to
Mortgagee, and (iii) at anytime after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, Mortgagee shall have the right to apply the insurance
proceeds (or Borrower shall repay an amount equal to any such proceeds not so
reinvested), FIRST, to reimburse Mortgagee and the holders of the Secured
Obligations for all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable
adjustors' and attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with
the collection of such proceeds, and, SECOND, the remainder of such proceeds
shall be applied, at Mortgagee's option, in payment (without premium or penalty)
of all or any part of the Secured Obligations, in the order and manner
determined by Mortgagee (provided that to the extent that any portion of the
Secured Obligations shall remain outstanding after such application, such unpaid
portion of the Secured Obligations shall continue in full force and effect and
Mortgagor shall not be excused from the payment thereof), or to the cure of any
then current default hereunder, or to the restoration, replacement or
rebuilding, in whole or in part, of the portion of the Premises so damaged,
destroyed or lost, provided that any insurance proceeds held by Mortgagee to be
applied to the restoration, replacement or rebuilding of the Premises shall be
so held without payment or allowance of interest thereon and shall be paid out
from time to time upon compliance by Mortgagor with such provisions and
requirements as may reasonably be imposed by Mortgagee. In the event that
Mortgagor shall have received or possess all or any portion of the insurance
proceeds, Mortgagor, upon demand from Mortgagee, shall pay to Mortgagee an
amount equal to the amount so received by Mortgagor, to be applied as Mortgagee
shall have the right pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding anything
herein or at law or in equity to the contrary, no insurance proceeds or payments
in lieu thereof paid to Mortgagee shall be deemed trust funds, and Mortgagee
shall be entitled to dispose of such proceeds as provided in this Section.

            (c) MORTGAGOR'S RIGHTS IF NO EVENT OF DEFAULT; APPLICATION OF
PROCEEDS. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
all insurance payments received by the Mortgagee in connection with any loss,
damage or destruction of any portion of the Premises will be released by the
Mortgagee to the Mortgagor, and such payments may be invested by the Mortgagor
in the business or used to prepay or retire Debt as permitted under the Credit
Agreement within one year following such release; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any
portion of such payments that has not been invested in the business or used to
prepay or retire Debt as permitted under the Credit Agreement within such
one-year period shall (i) be deemed to be Net Cash Proceeds occurring on the
last day of such one-year period and (ii) be applied to the prepayment of
Advances in accordance with Section 2.06(b)(ii) of the Credit Agreement;
PROVIDED FURTHER that, for purposes of the preceding PROVISO, such one-year
period shall be extended by up to six months from the last day of such one-year
period so long as (A) such payments are to be invested in the business or used
to prepay or retire Debt as permitted under the Credit Agreement within such
additional six-month period under the U.S. Borrower's or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries' business plan as most recently adopted in good faith by its board
of directors and (B) such Person believes in good faith that such proceeds will
be so reinvested within such additional six-month period. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of any Event of Default, all insurance payments in
respect of the Premises shall be paid to the Mortgagee and shall, in the
Mortgagee's sole discretion, (i) be released to the Mortgagor to be applied as
set forth in the first sentence of this subsection (a) or (ii) be held as
additional collateral hereunder or applied as specified in the Credit Agreement.

<Page>

            (d) REPAIR UNECONOMIC [OR NOT PERMITTED UNDER LEASE]. (i)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.08, where such
damage, destruction, or loss is substantial and Mortgagor determines, consistent
with a good faith business judgment, that (A) the Premises so damaged, destroyed
or lost is no longer desirable for the operation of Mortgagor's business or (B)
it would be uneconomic for Mortgagor to restore, replace or rebuild the
Premises, then Mortgagor shall not be required to restore, replace or rebuild
the Premises, and Mortgagee shall be entitled to apply all Awards relating
thereto in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section.

            (ii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.08,
       if Mortgagor, as a tenant under a Lease, does not have the right to
       perform any restoration, replacement or rebuilding contemplated by this
       Section 3.08, then Mortgagor shall not be obligated to perform such
       restoration, replacement or rebuilding and shall use all reasonable
       efforts to enforce Mortgagor's rights, if any, under such Lease to cause
       landlord thereunder to perform such restoration, replacement or
       rebuilding, but if such landlord fails or refuses to do so, Mortgagor
       shall not be in Default hereunder.]

            (e) EFFECT ON THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding any loss,
damage or destruction referred to in this Section, Mortgagor shall continue to
pay and perform the Secured Obligations as provided herein. Any reduction in the
Secured Obligations resulting from such application shall be deemed to take
effect only on the date of receipt by Mortgagee of such insurance proceeds and
application against the Secured Obligations, provided that if prior to the
receipt by Mortgagee of such insurance proceeds the Mortgaged Property shall
have been sold on foreclosure of this Mortgage, or shall have been transferred
by deed in lieu of foreclosure of this Mortgage, Mortgagee shall have the right
to receive the same to the extent of any deficiency found to be due upon such
sale, with legal interest thereon together with reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements incurred by Mortgagee in connection with the collection thereof.

            SECTION 3.09. Condemnation. (a) MORTGAGOR'S OBLIGATIONS;
PROCEEDINGS. Mortgagor, promptly upon obtaining knowledge of any pending or
threatened institution of any proceedings for the condemnation of the Premises,
or of any right of eminent domain which would materially adversely affect the
use and operation of the Premises as required hereunder, will notify Mortgagee
of the threat or pendency thereof. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, Mortgagee may participate in any such proceedings, and
Mortgagor from time to time will execute and deliver to Mortgagee all
instruments requested by Mortgagee or as may be required to permit such
participation. Mortgagor shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any such
proceedings, and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
(i) shall deliver to Mortgagee copies of all papers served in connection
therewith and shall consult and cooperate with Mortgagee, its attorneys and
agents, in the carrying on and defense of any such proceedings and (ii) shall
not settle any such proceeding without Mortgagee's consent.

            (b) MORTGAGEE'S RIGHTS; APPLICATION OF AWARDS. If an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Mortgagee shall have the right to apply
any Awards FIRST, to reimburse Mortgagee and the holders of the Secured
Obligations for all reasonable costs and expenses, including reasonable
appraiser and attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with the
collection of such proceeds, and, SECOND, the remainder of such Awards shall be
applied, at Mortgagee's option, in payment (without premium or penalty) of all
or any part of the Secured Obligations, in the order and manner determined by
Mortgagee (provided that to the extent that any portion of the Secured
Obligations shall remain outstanding after such application, such unpaid portion
of the Secured Obligations shall continue in full force and effect and Mortgagor
shall not be excused from the payment thereof), or to the cure of any then
current default hereunder, or to the restoration, replacement or rebuilding, in
whole or in part, of the portion of the Premises so taken or condemned provided
that any Awards held by Mortgagee to be

<Page>

applied to the restoration, replacement or rebuilding of the Premises shall be
so held without payment or allowance of interest thereon and shall be paid out
from time to time upon compliance by Mortgagor with such provisions and
requirements as may reasonably be imposed by Mortgagee. In the event that
Mortgagor shall have received all or any portion of such Awards, Mortgagor, upon
demand from Mortgagee, shall pay to Mortgagee an amount equal to the amount so
received by Mortgagor, to be applied as Mortgagee shall have the right pursuant
to this subsection. Notwithstanding anything herein or at law or in equity to
the contrary, none of the Awards paid to Mortgagee under this Section shall be
deemed trust funds and Mortgagee shall be entitled to dispose of the same as
provided in this Section.

            (c) MORTGAGOR'S RIGHTS IF NO EVENT OF DEFAULT; APPLICATION OF
PROCEEDS. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, in the event of a condemnation of all or any portion
of the Premises in connection with which Awards shall have been paid, then
Mortgagor shall be entitled to collect an amount not to exceed Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000.00), in each calendar year, from the applicable
governmental or other lawful authorities directly (or from Mortgagee if such
proceeds shall have been paid to Mortgagee by such governmental or other lawful
authorities). Any Award collected by Mortgagor pursuant to this subsection (c),
shall be treated for all purposes as Net Cash Proceeds under the Credit
Agreement.

            (d) REPAIR UNECONOMIC [OR NOT PERMITTED UNDER LEASE]. (i)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.09, where a
substantial portion of the Premises is condemned or taken and Mortgagor
determines, consistent with a good faith business judgment, that (A) the portion
of the Premises subject to such condemnation or taking is no longer desirable
for the operation of Mortgagor's business or (B) it would be uneconomic for
Mortgagor to replace or, if applicable, restore or repair such portion of the
Premises, then Mortgagor shall not be required to replace, restore or repair
such Property , and Mortgagee shall be entitled to apply all Awards relating
thereto in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section.

            (ii)  [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
       3.09, if Mortgagor, as a tenant under a Lease, does not have the right or
       obligation to replace, restore or repair the Premises as contemplated by
       this Section 3.09, then Mortgagor shall not be obligated to replace,
       restore or repair the Premises and shall use all reasonable efforts to
       enforce Mortgagor's rights, if any, under such Lease to cause landlord to
       restore, replace or repair the Premises, but if such landlord fails or
       refuses to do so, Mortgagor shall not be in Default hereunder.]

            (e) EFFECT ON THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS. Notwithstanding any
condemnation, taking or other proceeding referred to in this Section, Mortgagor
shall continue to pay and perform the Secured Obligations as provided herein.
Any reduction in the Secured Obligations resulting from such application shall
be deemed to take effect only on the date of receipt by Mortgagee of such Awards
and application against the Secured Obligations, provided that if prior to the
receipt by Mortgagee of such Awards the Mortgaged Property shall have been sold
on foreclosure of this Mortgage, or shall have been transferred by deed in lieu
of foreclosure of this Mortgage, Mortgagee shall have the right to receive the
same to the extent of any deficiency found to be due upon such sale, with legal
interest thereon together with reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements
incurred by Mortgagee in connection with the collection thereof.

            SECTION 3.10. Covenants Concerning the Leases. Mortgagor hereby
represents, warrants, covenants and agrees that:

            (a) If any of the Leases is rejected or disaffirmed by the lessor
thereunder (or by any receiver, trustee, custodian or other party who succeeds
to the rights of such lessor) pursuant to any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar law (any such law hereinafter collectively

<Page>

referred to as a "BANKRUPTCY LAW"), Mortgagor covenants that, except as
otherwise permitted pursuant to Section 5.01(h) of the Credit Agreement, it will
not elect to treat such Lease as terminated under 11 U.S.C. / / 365(h) or any
similar or successor law or right. If an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, Mortgagee shall have the sole and exclusive right to make or refrain
from making any such election, and Mortgagor agrees that any such election, if
made by Mortgagor other than in accordance with this subsection, shall be void
and of no force or effect.

            (b) If the lessor under any Lease (or any receiver, trustee,
custodian or other party who succeeds to the rights of such lessor) rejects or
disaffirms such Lease pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law and an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, Mortgagee may elect to have Mortgagor remain in
possession under any legal right Mortgagor may have to occupy the premises
leased pursuant to such Lease, and upon such election (A) Mortgagor shall remain
in such possession and shall perform all acts necessary for Mortgagor to retain
its right to remain in such possession for the unexpired term of such Lease
(including all renewals thereof), whether such acts are required under the then
existing terms and provisions of such Lease or otherwise, and (B) all of the
terms and provisions of this Mortgage and the lien created hereby shall remain
in full force and effect and shall be extended automatically to such possession,
occupancy and interest of Mortgagor.

            (c) Mortgagor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
lessor under each of the Leases to agree in writing that in the event of (A) the
rejection or disaffirmance by Mortgagor (or by any receiver, trustee, custodian
or other party who succeeds to the rights of Mortgagor) of such Lease pursuant
to any Bankruptcy Law or (B) Mortgagor's inability to satisfy all conditions
necessary to permit Mortgagor (or such receiver, trustee, custodian or other
party) to assume and preserve the Lease pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law, such
lessor will, at Mortgagee's request and option, (i) allow Mortgagee or its
designee to cure any monetary defaults of Mortgagor and to become the lessee
under such Lease and agree that Mortgagee or its designee shall have no
responsibility for, and such lease will not be terminated by virtue of, any past
non-monetary default of Mortgagor or enter into a new lease of the Leased Land
with Mortgagee or a designee of Mortgagee for the remainder of the term
(including renewals thereof) of such Lease (a "NEW LEASE"), effective as of the
date of such rejection or disaffirmance, at the rent and upon all the terms and
provisions of such Lease, provided that any improvements to and any property on
or related to the Leased Land shall immediately, upon execution and delivery to
Mortgagee or its designee, vest in Mortgagee or such designee, as the case may
be (subject to the reversionary interest of the lessor therein upon the
expiration or termination of the New Lease). Mortgagor agrees to execute such
other instruments as Mortgagee may reasonably request to confirm Mortgagee's or
such designee's right, title and interest in and to the New Lease and any
improvements and/or property appurtenant thereto.

            (d) If an event described in Section 7.01(f) of the Credit Agreement
shall occur, Mortgagor covenants that (A) it shall not reject or disaffirm any
of the Leases without the prior consent of Mortgagee, and (B) at the direction
of Mortgagee it shall, in a timely fashion, (I) take all actions (including
curing all existing defaults and providing assurance of future performance) as
may be required to permit Mortgagor to assume any such Lease and (II) assume
such Lease.]

            SECTION 3.11. Contest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Mortgagor shall have the right to contest in good faith and at
its own expense the validity or applicability of any duty or obligation
described in Section 3.03, the validity of any lien, encumbrance, charge or
security referred to in Section 3.06 and any Imposition imposed upon the
Premises (a "CONTEST") by an appropriate legal proceeding which proceeding must
operate to prevent the collection of such Impositions or other realization
thereon and the sale or forfeiture of the Mortgaged Property or any part thereof
to satisfy the same; provided, however, that if at any time payment of any
Imposition which is the subject of such a Contest shall become necessary to
prevent (i) the delivery of a tax deed conveying the Mortgaged

<Page>

Property because of non-payment or (ii) the imposition of any civil or criminal
penalty or liability on Mortgagee or the holders of the Secured Obligations,
Mortgagor shall pay the same in sufficient time to avoid the delivery of such
tax deed or the imposition of any such penalty or liability.

            SECTION 3.12. Notice Limiting Amount. Mortgagor covenants that it
will not, without the prior written consent of Mortgagee, file of record any
notice limiting the maximum principal amount secured by this Mortgage.

            SECTION 3.13. Compliance with Environmental Laws. Mortgagor agrees
to comply with Sections 5.01(o) and 5.01(p) of the Credit Agreement. In the
event that Mortgagor does not expeditiously proceed with any compliance required
under any Environmental Law as provided in the Credit Agreement, Mortgagee,
immediately after notice to Mortgagor, may elect to undertake such compliance.
Any monies expended by Mortgagee in efforts to comply with any Environmental Law
(including the costs of hiring consultants, undertaking sampling and testing,
performing any cleanup necessary or useful in the compliance process and
attorney's fees and disbursements) will be reimbursed by Mortgagor to Mortgagee
on demand, will bear interest until paid in full at the default rate as provided
in the Credit Agreement and will be secured by this Mortgage.

            SECTION 3.14. Permits. Mortgagor has and will maintain all necessary
certificates, licenses, authorizations, registrations, permits and/or approvals
necessary for the operation, use and occupancy of the Premises and the conduct
of Mortgagor's business at the Premises and, promptly upon reasonable request by
Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall deliver to Mortgagee copies of all of the same.

            SECTION 3.15. Compliance With Applicable Laws. The Premises and the
operation, use and occupancy thereof do not and will not violate in any material
respect any present or future federal, state, municipal or local laws,
ordinances, rules, regulations, requirements, judgments, decrees,
determinations, awards or court orders, including all environmental laws and
zoning ordinances (collectively, "APPLICABLE LAWS"), and Mortgagor shall cause
the Premises and the operation, use and occupancy thereof to continue to be in
substantial compliance with all Applicable Laws except such as may be contested
in good faith or as to which a bona fide dispute may exist.

            SECTION 3.16. Further Assurances. Mortgagor shall:

            (i)   at Mortgagor's sole cost and expense and at the reasonable
       request of Mortgagee, (A) promptly correct any defect or error which may
       be discovered in the contents of this Mortgage or in its execution,
       acknowledgment or recordation and (B) promptly do, execute, acknowledge
       and deliver any and all such further acts, deeds, conveyances, mortgages,
       deeds of trust, trust deeds, assignments, estoppel certificates,
       financing statements and continuations thereof, notices of assignment,
       transfers, certificates, assurances and other instruments that may be
       necessary or desirable or that Mortgagee may reasonably request from time
       to time in order to carry out more effectively the purposes of this
       Mortgage, to subject to the lien and security interest hereby created on
       any of Mortgagor's properties, rights or interests covered or now or
       hereafter intended to be covered hereby, to perfect and maintain said
       lien and security interest, and to better assure, convey, grant, assign,
       transfer and confirm unto Mortgagee the rights granted or now or
       hereafter intended to be granted to Mortgagee hereunder or under any
       other instrument executed in connection with this Mortgage or which
       Mortgagor may be or become bound to convey, mortgage or assign to
       Mortgagee in order to carry out the intention or facilitate the
       performance of the provisions of this Mortgage; and

            (ii)  at the reasonable request of Mortgagee, promptly record
       and re-record, file and refile and register and re-register this
       Mortgage, any financing or continuation statements and

<Page>

       every other instrument in addition or supplemental to any thereof that
       shall be required by any present or future law in order to perfect and
       maintain the validity, effectiveness and priority of this Mortgage and
       the lien and security interest intended to be created hereby, or to
       subject after-acquired property of Mortgagor to such lien and security
       interest, in such manner and places and within such times as may be
       necessary to accomplish such purposes and to preserve and protect the
       rights and remedies of Mortgagee. Upon any failure by Mortgagor to do so
       after request by Mortgagee, Mortgagee may make, execute, record, file,
       re-record or refile any and all such mortgages, instruments, certificates
       and documents for and in the name of Mortgagor, and Mortgagor hereby
       irrevocably appoints Mortgagee the agent and attorney-in-fact of
       Mortgagor to do so, which appointment will terminate upon the
       satisfaction of record of this Mortgage. Mortgagor will furnish to
       Mortgagee evidence reasonably satisfactory to Mortgagee of every such
       recording, filing or registration. Mortgagee may, at Mortgagor's sole
       expense, file copies or reproductions of this instrument as financing
       statements at any time and from time to time at Mortgagee's option
       without further authorization from Mortgagor.

            SECTION 3.17. Subordinate Leases (a) ASSIGNMENT. Mortgagor hereby
absolutely and presently bargains, sells, transfers, assigns and sets over to
Mortgagee, as further security for the payment of the Secured Obligations, all
of its right, title and interest in and to the Subordinate Leases and the Rents
payable thereunder and all rights of Mortgagor thereunder and any and all
deposits held as security under the Subordinate Leases, whether before or after
foreclosure or during the full period of redemption, if any, and shall, upon
demand, deliver to Mortgagee an executed counterpart of each Subordinate Lease.
The assignment of the Subordinate Leases and Rents, and of the aforesaid rights
with respect thereto, is intended to be and is an absolute present assignment
from Mortgagor to Mortgagee and not merely the passing of a security interest.
Such assignment and grant shall continue in effect until the Secured Obligations
are paid, the execution of this Mortgage constituting and evidencing the
irrevocable consent of Mortgagor to the entry upon and taking possession of the
Premises by Mortgagee pursuant to such grant, whether foreclosure has been
instituted or not and without applying for a receiver. Unless a Default under
Section 7.01(a) or 7.01(f) of the Credit Agreement has occurred and is
continuing or an Event of Default has occurred, Mortgagor shall be entitled to
collect and receive the Rents and agrees to hold the same in trust. Such right
of Mortgagor to collect and receive said Rents shall be automatically revoked if
a Default under Section 7.01(a) or 7.01(f) of the Credit Agreement has occurred
and is continuing or an Event of Default has occurred and thereafter Mortgagee
shall have the right and authority to exercise any of the rights or remedies
referred to or set forth in Article VI. In addition, if a Default under Section
7.01(a) or 7.01(f) of the Credit Agreement has occurred and is continuing or an
Event of Default has occurred, Mortgagor shall promptly pay to Mortgagee (i) all
rent prepayments and security or other deposits paid to Mortgagor pursuant to
any lease assigned hereunder and (ii) all charges for services or facilities or
for escalation which were paid pursuant to any such lease to the extent
allocable to any period from and after the occurrence and continuance of a
Default under Section 7.01(a) or 7.01(f) of the Credit Agreement or after the
occurrence of an Event of Default. Nothing contained in this Section 3.15 (a)
shall be construed to bind Mortgagee to the performance of any of the covenants,
conditions or provisions contained in any Subordinate Lease or otherwise to
impose any obligation on Mortgagee (including any liability under the covenant
of quiet enjoyment contained in any Subordinate Lease or under any applicable
law in the event that any tenant shall have been joined as a party defendant in
any action to foreclose this Mortgage and shall have been barred and foreclosed
thereby of all right, title and interest and equity of redemption in the
Premises), except that Mortgagee shall be accountable for any money actually
received pursuant to such assignment. Mortgagor hereby further grants to
Mortgagee the right to notify the tenant under any Subordinate Lease of the
assignment thereof and, if a Default under Section 7.01(a) or 7.01(f) of the
Credit Agreement has occurred and is continuing or an Event of Default has
occurred (i) to demand that the tenant under any Subordinate Lease pay all
amounts due thereunder directly to Mortgagee, (ii) to enter upon and take
possession of the Premises for the purpose of collecting the Rents, (iii) to
dispossess by the usual summary proceedings any tenant

<Page>

defaulting in the payment thereof, (iv) to let the Premises, or any part
thereof, and (v) to apply the Rents, after payment of all necessary charges and
expenses, on account of the Secured Obligations.

            (b) Mortgagor's Obligation to Pay Rent. If Mortgagor is not required
to surrender possession of the Premises hereunder in the event of any Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, Mortgagor will pay monthly in advance to
Mortgagee, on its entry into possession pursuant to Article VI, or to any
receiver appointed to collect said Rents, the fair and reasonable rental value
for the use and occupation of the Premises or such part thereof as may be in the
possession of Mortgagor. Upon a default in any such payment, Mortgagor will
vacate and surrender such possession to Mortgagee or such receiver, and, in
default thereof, may be evicted by summary or any other available proceedings or
actions.

            (c) Mortgagor will (i) perform or cause to be performed all the
lessor's obligations under any Subordinate Lease that is material to Mortgagor
(a "MATERIAL SUBORDINATE LEASE"), (ii) enforce (including the termination and
cancellation of any Material Subordinate Lease, so long as the same is a bona
fide enforcement of Mortgagor's right as lessor under any such Material
Subordinate Lease and such termination or cancellation, either by itself or in
the aggregate with other terminations and cancellations, will not diminish or
impair the security of this Mortgage) the performance by the lessee under its
respective Subordinate Lease of all of said lessee's obligations thereunder and
(iii) give Mortgagee prompt notice and a copy of any notice of default, event of
default, termination or cancellation sent or received by Mortgagor with respect
to any Material Subordinate Lease;

            (d) (i) Except as provided in subsection (c), Mortgagor will not,
without Mortgagee's consent, (1) assign, mortgage, pledge or otherwise transfer,
dispose of or encumber, whether by operation of law or otherwise, any Material
Subordinate Lease or any of the Rents, (2) accept or permit the acceptance of a
prepayment of any amounts payable under such Material Subordinate Lease for more
than one month in advance of the due date therefor, (3) enter into, amend,
modify, cancel, terminate or accept a surrender of any Material Subordinate
Lease or (4) enter into any Material Subordinate Lease after the date hereof.

            (ii)  Supplementing the provisions of paragraph (i) of this
       subsection (d), if the lessee under any Material Subordinate Lease (or
       any receiver, trustee, custodian or other party who succeeds to the
       rights of any lessee) rejects or disaffirms such Material Subordinate
       Lease pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law, Mortgagor hereby assigns to
       Mortgagee the proceeds of any claims (including the right to retain or
       apply any security deposits) that Mortgagor may have against the lessee
       (or receiver, trustee, custodian or other party who succeeds to the
       rights of any lessee) and any guarantor of any of the Material
       Subordinate Leases, under any one or more of the Material Subordinate
       Leases or any guaranty thereof based upon (1) any breach by such lessee
       of the terms and provisions of the applicable Lease (including any claim
       that Mortgagor may have by reason of a termination, rejection or
       disaffirmance of such Subordinate Lease pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law),
       and (2) the use and occupancy of the premises demised thereby, whether or
       not pursuant to the applicable Subordinate Lease (including any claim for
       use and occupancy arising under any Bankruptcy Law). Mortgagor,
       immediately upon obtaining knowledge of any such breach or use by any
       such lessee, will notify Mortgagee of any such breach or use. Mortgagee
       shall have the sole right to elect, either:

              (a) to proceed against such lessee or guarantor as if it were
       the named lessor thereunder, in Mortgagor's name or in Mortgagee's name
       as agent for Mortgagor and Mortgagor agrees to cooperate with Mortgagee
       in such action and shall execute any and all documents required in
       furtherance of such action; or

<Page>

              (b) to have Mortgagor proceed in Mortgagor's and Mortgagee's
       behalf in which event Mortgagee may participate in any such proceedings,
       and Mortgagor from time to time will deliver to Mortgagee all instruments
       requested by Mortgagee or as may be required to permit such
       participation. Mortgagor shall, at its expense, diligently prosecute any
       such proceedings, shall deliver to Mortgagee copies of all papers served
       in connection therewith and shall consult and cooperate with Mortgagee,
       its attorneys and agents, in the carrying on and defense of any such
       proceedings; provided that no settlement of any such proceeding shall be
       made by Mortgagor without Mortgagee's consent.


                                   ARTICLE IV.

                    ADDITIONAL ADVANCES; EXPENSES; INDEMNITY

            SECTION 4.01. Additional Advances and Disbursements. (a) Mortgagor
agrees that, if Mortgagor shall default in any of its obligations hereunder,
then Mortgagee shall have the right without notice to Mortgagor to advance all
or any part of amounts owing or to perform any or all required actions. No such
advance or performance shall be deemed to have cured such default by Mortgagor
or any Event of Default with respect thereto. All sums advanced and all expenses
incurred by Mortgagee in connection with such advances or actions, and all other
sums advanced or expenses incurred by Mortgagee hereunder or under applicable
law (whether required or optional and whether indemnified hereunder or not)
shall be part of the Secured Obligations, shall bear interest at the Default
Rate and as provided in the Credit Agreement and shall be secured by this
Mortgage. Mortgagor hereby appoints Mortgagee its true and lawful
attorney-in-fact to make the payments and effect the performance contemplated by
the aforesaid provisions in the name and on behalf of Mortgagor. This
appointment, being coupled with an interest, shall be irrevocable until all of
the Secured Obligations shall be fully satisfied, paid and performed and
Mortgagee shall have no further Secured Obligations.

            (b) This Mortgage secures all Secured Obligations of Mortgagor and
the other Loan Parties Borrowers, a portion of which will be constituted by
revolving credit indebtedness pursuant to which Mortgagor and/or the other Loan
Parties may borrow, repay and reborrow. This Mortgage secures not only initial
advances of such revolving credit indebtedness, but also all future advances of
the revolving credit indebtedness and all additional indebtedness, whether
direct, indirect, future, contingent or otherwise, connected with or arising out
of the Credit Agreement, as the same may hereafter by amended, to the extent of
not more than the Maximum Amount.

            SECTION 4.02. Other Expenses. Mortgagor will pay or, on demand,
reimburse Mortgagee or any holder of the Secured Obligations for the payment of
any and all reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and disbursements) incurred in connection with (i) any default or Event of
Default by Mortgagor hereunder, (ii) the exercise or enforcement by or on behalf
of Mortgagee or any holder of the Secured Obligations of any of its rights or of
Mortgagor's obligations under the Loan Documents or (iii) the granting,
administration, enforcement and closing of the transactions contemplated
hereunder.

            SECTION 4.03. Interest After Default. If any payment due hereunder
or under the other Loan Documents is not paid in full when due, whether by
acceleration or otherwise, then the same shall bear interest hereunder at the
Default Rate, and such interest shall be added to and become a part of the
Secured Obligations and shall be secured hereby.

            SECTION 4.04. Indemnity. Mortgagor agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Administrative Agent, each Lender Party and each of their
Affiliates and their officers, directors,

<Page>

employees, agents and advisors (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including,
without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) that may be
incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each case
arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including, without
limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or
preparation of a defense in connection therewith which may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties in connection
with any transaction in any way connected with the Mortgaged Property or the
Loan Documents, except to the extent any such loss, damage, claim, cost or
expense is the result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the
indemnified party. Any amount payable under this Section shall be deemed a
demand obligation, shall be added to and become a part of the Secured
Obligations, shall bear interest at the default rate as provided in the Credit
Agreement, and shall be secured by this Mortgage.


                                   ARTICLE V.

                        SALE OR TRANSFER OF THE PREMISES

nature to the transaction hereinabove described and Mortgagee's agreement to
create the Secured Obligations. Without Mortgagee's prior written consent,

or otherwise transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, (b) permit to be the
subject of any transaction described in clause (a) above, (c) enter into an

specific Transfers expressly permitted by Section 5.02(d) of the Credit

equitable interest therein, regardless whether or not Mortgagee has consented

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

            SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. The occurrence of an "Event of
Default" under the Credit Agreement shall be an Event of Default hereunder and
upon acceleration of the indebtedness evidenced by the Credit Agreement, all
Secured Obligations shall immediately become due and payable without further
notice to Mortgagor .

            SECTION 6.02. Remedies. Upon the occurrence and continuance of any
Event of Default, Mortgagee may, in addition to any rights or remedies available
to it hereunder or under the other Loan Documents and to the extent permitted by
applicable law, take such action personally or by its agents or attorneys, with
or without entry, and without notice, demand, presentment or protest (each and
all of which are hereby waived), as it deems necessary or advisable to protect
and enforce its rights and remedies against Mortgagor and in and to the
Mortgaged Property, including the following actions, each

order as Mortgagee may determine, in its sole discretion, without impairing or
otherwise affecting its other rights or remedies:

            otherwise, for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Mortgage
            under any applicable provision of law; or

                  (ii)  sell the Mortgaged Property, and all estate, right,
            title, interest, claim and demand of Mortgagor therein, and all
            rights of redemption thereof, at one or more sales, as an entirety
            or in parcels, with such elements of real and/or personal property,
            and at such time and place and upon such terms as it may deem
            expedient, or as may be required by applicable law, and in the event
            of a sale, by foreclosure or otherwise, of less than all of the
            Mortgaged Property, this Mortgage shall continue as a lien and
            security interest on the remaining portion of the Mortgaged
            Property; or

                  (iii) institute an action, suit or proceeding in equity for

            Loan Documents; or

                  (iv)  apply for the appointment of a receiver, custodian,
            trustee, liquidator or conservator of the Mortgaged Property, to be
            vested with the fullest powers permitted under applicable law, as a
            matter of right and without regard to, or the necessity to disprove,
            the adequacy of the security for the Secured Obligations or the
            solvency of Mortgagor or any other person liable for the payment of

            (i) entering into such contracts and taking such other action as
            Mortgagee deems appropriate to complete any construction on the

            whatsoever with Mortgagor, and (viii) altering or amending any
            contracts between them, in any manner Mortgagee may determine); and
            upon each such entry and from time to time thereafter may, at the
            expense of Mortgagor and the Mortgaged Property, without
            interference by Mortgagor and as Mortgagee may deem advisable, (i)
            insure or reinsure the Premises, (ii) make all necessary or proper
            repairs, renewals, replacements, alterations, additions, betterments
            and improvements thereto and thereon and (iii) in every such case in
            connection with the foregoing have the

<Page>

            right to exercise all rights and powers of Mortgagor with respect to
            the Mortgaged Property, either in Mortgagor's name or otherwise; or

                  (vi)  with or without the entrance upon the Premises, collect,
            receive, sue for and recover in its own name all Rents and cash
            collateral derived from the Mortgaged Property, and after deducting
            therefrom all reasonable costs, expenses and liabilities of every
            character incurred by Mortgagee in collecting the same and in using,
            operating, managing, preserving and controlling the Mortgaged
            Property, and otherwise in exercising Mortgagee's rights under
            subsection (e) of this Section, including all amounts necessary to
            pay Impositions, insurance premiums and other charges in connection
            with the Premises, as well as compensation for the services of
            Mortgagee and their respective attorneys, agents and employees, to
            apply the remainder as provided in Section 6.05; or

                  (vii) release any portion of the Mortgaged Property for such
            consideration as Mortgagee may require without, as to the remainder
            of the Mortgaged Property, in any way impairing or affecting the
            lien or priority of this Mortgage, or improving the position of any
            subordinate lienholder with respect thereto, except to the extent
            that the Secured Obligations shall have been reduced by the actual
            monetary consideration, if any, received by Mortgagee for such
            release and applied to the Secured Obligations, and may accept by
            assignment, pledge or otherwise any other property in place thereof
            as Mortgagee may require without being accountable for so doing to
            any other lienholder; or

                  (viii)take all actions permitted under the Uniform Commercial
            Code in effect in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property
            is located; or

                  (ix)  take any other action, or pursue any other right or
            remedy, as Mortgagee may have under applicable law, and Mortgagor
            does hereby grant the same to Mortgagee.

            In the event that Mortgagee shall exercise any of the rights or
remedies set forth in subsections (e) and (f) of this Section, Mortgagee shall
not be deemed to have entered upon or taken possession of the Mortgaged Property
except upon the exercise of its option to do so, evidenced by its demand and
overt act for such purpose, nor shall it be deemed a beneficiary or mortgagee in
possession by reason of such entry or taking possession. Mortgagee shall not be
liable to account for any action taken pursuant to any such exercise other than
for Rents actually received by Mortgagee, nor liable for any loss sustained by
Mortgagor resulting from any failure to let the Premises, or from any other act
or omission of Mortgagee except to the extent such loss is caused by the willful
misconduct or bad faith of Mortgagee.

            SECTION 6.03. Rights Pertaining to Sales. Subject to the provisions
or other requirements of law and except as otherwise provided herein, the
following provisions shall apply to any sale or sales of all or any portion of
the Mortgaged Property under or by virtue of this Article VI, whether made under
the power of sale herein granted or by virtue of judicial proceedings or of a
judgment or decree of foreclosure and sale:

                  (i)   Mortgagee may conduct any number of sales from time to
            time. The power of sale set forth in Section 6.02(c) hereof shall
            not be exhausted by any one or more such sales as to any part of the
            Mortgaged Property which shall not have been sold, nor by any sale
            which is not completed or is defective in Mortgagee's opinion, until
            the Secured Obligations shall have been paid in full.

<Page>

                  (ii)  Any sale may be postponed or adjourned by public
            announcement at the time and place appointed for such sale or for
            such postponed or adjourned sale without further notice. Without
            limiting the foregoing, in case Mortgagee shall have proceeded to
            enforce any right or remedy under this Mortgage by receiver, entry
            or otherwise, and such proceedings have been discontinued or
            abandoned for any such reason or shall have been determined
            adversely to Mortgagee, then in every such case Mortgagor and
            Mortgagee shall be restored to their former positions and rights
            hereunder, and all rights, powers and remedies of Mortgagee shall
            continue as if no such proceeding had been taken.

                  (iii) After each sale, Mortgagee or an officer of any court
            empowered to do so shall execute and deliver to the purchaser or
            purchasers at such sale a good and sufficient instrument or
            instruments granting, conveying, assigning and transferring all
            right, title and interest of Mortgagor in and to the property and
            rights sold and shall receive the proceeds of said sale or sales and
            apply the same as herein provided. Mortgagee is hereby appointed the
            true and lawful attorney-in-fact of Mortgagor, which appointment is
            irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest, in
            Mortgagor's name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances,
            assignments, transfers and deliveries of the property and rights so
            sold, and for that purpose Mortgagee may execute all necessary
            instruments of conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery, and
            may substitute one or more persons with like power, Mortgagor hereby
            ratifying and confirming all that said attorney or such substitute
            or substitutes shall lawfully do by virtue thereof. Nevertheless,
            Mortgagor, if requested by Mortgagee, shall ratify and confirm any
            such sale or sales by executing and delivering to Mortgagee or such
            purchaser or purchasers all such instruments as may be advisable, in
            Mortgagee's judgment, for the purposes as may be designated in such
            request.

                  (iv)  Any and all statements of fact or other recitals made in
            any of the instruments referred to in subsection (c) of this Section
            given by Mortgagee as to nonpayment of the Secured Obligations, or
            as to the occurrence of any default or Event of Default, or as to
            Mortgagee having declared all or any of the Secured Obligations to
            be due and payable, or as to the request to sell, or as to notice of
            time, place and terms of sale and of the property or rights to be
            sold having been duly given, or as to any other act or thing having
            been duly done by Mortgagor or Mortgagee shall be taken as
            conclusive and binding against all persons as to evidence of the
            truth of the facts so stated and recited. Mortgagee may appoint or
            delegate any one or more persons as agent to perform any act or acts
            necessary or incident to any sale so held, including the posting of
            notices and the conduct of sale.

                  (v)   The receipt of Mortgagee for the purchase money paid at
            any such sale, or the receipt of any other person authorized to
            receive the same, shall be sufficient discharge therefor to any
            purchaser of any property or rights sold as aforesaid, and no such
            purchaser, or its representatives, grantees or assigns, after paying
            such purchase price and receiving such receipt, shall be bound to
            see to the application of such purchase price or any part thereof
            upon or for any trust or purpose of this Mortgage or, in any manner
            whatsoever, be answerable for any loss, misapplication or
            nonapplication of any such purchase money, or part thereof, or be
            bound to inquire as to the authorization, necessity, expediency or
            regularity of any such sale.

                  (vi)  Any such sale or sales shall operate to divest all of
            the estate, right, title, interest, claim and demand whatsoever,
            whether at law or in equity, of Mortgagor in and

<Page>

            to the properties and rights so sold, and shall be a perpetual bar
            both at law and in equity against Mortgagor and any and all persons
            claiming or who may claim the same, or any part thereof or any
            interest therein, by, through or under Mortgagor to the fullest
            extent permitted by applicable law.

                  (vii) Upon any such sale or sales, Mortgagee may bid for and
            acquire the Mortgaged Property and, in lieu of paying cash therefor,
            may make settlement for the purchase price by crediting against the
            Secured Obligations the amount of the bid made therefor, after
            deducting therefrom the expenses of the sale, the cost of any
            enforcement proceeding hereunder, and any other sums which Mortgagee
            is authorized to deduct under the terms hereof, to the extent
            necessary to satisfy such bid.

                  (viii)In the event that Mortgagor, or any person claiming by,
            through or under Mortgagor, shall transfer or refuse or fail to
            surrender possession of the Mortgaged Property after any sale
            thereof, then Mortgagor, or such person, shall be deemed a tenant at
            sufferance of the purchaser at such sale, subject to eviction by
            means of forcible entry and unlawful detainer proceedings, or
            subject to any other right or remedy available hereunder or under
            applicable law.

                  (ix)  Upon any such sale, it shall not be necessary for
            Mortgagee or any public officer acting under execution or order of
            court to have present or constructively in its possession any of the
            Mortgaged Property.

                  (x) In the event a foreclosure hereunder shall be commenced by
            Mortgagee, Mortgagee may at any time before the sale of the
            Mortgaged Property abandon the sale, and may institute suit for the
            collection of the Secured Obligations and for the foreclosure of
            this Mortgage, or in the event that Mortgagee should institute a
            suit for collection of the Secured Obligations, and for the
            foreclosure of this Mortgage, Mortgagee may at any time before the
            entry of final judgment in said suit dismiss the same and require
            Mortgagee to sell the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the
            provisions of this Mortgage.

            SECTION 6.04. Expenses. In any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, to
foreclose this Mortgage or enforce any other remedy of Mortgagee under the Loan
Documents, there shall be allowed and included as an addition to and a part of
the Secured Obligations in the decree for sale or other judgment or decree all
expenditures and expenses which may be paid or incurred in connection with the
exercise by Mortgagee of any of its rights and remedies provided or referred to
in Section 6.02, or any comparable provision of any other Loan Document,
together with interest thereon at the rate and as provided in the Credit
Agreement, and the same shall be part of the Secured Obligations and shall be
secured by this Mortgage.

            SECTION 6.05. Application of Proceeds. The purchase money, proceeds
or avails of any sale referred to in Section 6.02, together with any other sums
which may be held by Mortgagee hereunder, whether under the provisions of this
Article VI or otherwise, shall, except as herein expressly provided to the
contrary, be applied as follows:

       FIRST: To the payment of the costs and expenses of any such sale,
     including compensation to Mortgagee, their agents and counsel, and of any
     judicial proceeding wherein the same may be made, and of all expenses,
     liabilities and advances made or incurred by Mortgagee hereunder, together
     with interest thereon as provided herein, and all Impositions and other
     charges, except any Impositions or other charges subject to which the
     Mortgaged Property shall have been sold.

<Page>

       SECOND: To the payment in full of the monetary Secured Obligations
     (including principal, interest, premium and fees) in such order as
     Mortgagee may elect.

       THIRD: To the payment of any other sums secured hereunder or required to
     be paid by Mortgagor pursuant to any provision of the Loan Documents.

       FOURTH: To the extent permitted by applicable law, to be set aside by
     Mortgagee as adequate security in its judgment for the payment of sums
     which would have been paid by application under clauses FIRST through THIRD
     above to Mortgagee, arising out of an obligation or liability with respect
     to which Mortgagor has agreed to indemnify Mortgagee, but which sums are
     not yet due and payable or liquidated.

       FIFTH: To the payment of any withholding tax requirements of the Foreign
     Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980, as amended.

       SIXTH: To the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomsoever may be
lawfully entitled to receive the same.

            SECTION 6.06. Additional Provisions as to Remedies. (a) No delay or
omission by Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy hereunder upon any default
or Event of Default shall impair such exercise, or be construed to be a waiver
of any such default or Event of Default.

            (b) The failure, refusal or waiver (by consent, waiver or otherwise)
of Mortgagee to assert any right or remedy hereunder upon any default or Event
of Default or other occurrence shall not be construed as waiving such right or
remedy upon any other or subsequent default or Event of Default or other
occurrence.

            (c) Mortgagee shall have no obligation to pursue any rights or
remedies it may have under any other agreement prior to pursuing its rights or
remedies hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.

            (d) Acceptance of any payment after the occurrence of any default or
Event of Default shall not be deemed a waiver or a cure of such default or Event
of Default, and acceptance of any payment less than any amount then due shall be
deemed an acceptance on account only.

            (e) In the event that Mortgagee shall have proceeded to enforce any
right or remedy hereunder by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise, and such
proceeding shall be discontinued, abandoned or determined adversely for any
reason, then Mortgagor and Mortgagee shall be restored to their former positions
and rights hereunder with respect to the Mortgaged Property, subject to the lien
hereof.

            (f) Each right of Mortgagee provided for in this Mortgage shall be
cumulative and shall be in addition to every other right provided for in this
Mortgage or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity, by statute or
otherwise, and the exercise by Mortgagee of any one or more of such rights shall
not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Mortgagee of any other such
right.

            SECTION 6.07. Waiver of Rights and Defenses. To the full extent
Mortgagor may lawfully do so, Mortgagor agrees with Mortgagee as follows:

            (i)   Mortgagor will not, at any time, insist on, plead, claim or
take the benefit or advantage of any statute or rule of law now or hereafter in
force providing for any appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, moratorium,
redemption or reinstatement, or of any statute of limitations, and Mortgagor,
for itself and its heirs, devisees, representatives, successors and assigns, and
for any and all Persons ever claiming an interest in the Mortgaged Property
(other than Mortgagee), hereby, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
waives and releases all rights of redemption, reinstatement, valuation,

<Page>

appraisement, and notice of intention to mature or declare due the whole of the
Secured Obligations and all rights to a marshaling of the assets of Mortgagor,
including the Mortgaged Property, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation,
in the event of foreclosure of the liens and security interests created
hereunder.

            (ii)  Mortgagor shall not have or assert any right under any
statute or rule of law pertaining to any of the matters set forth in subsection
(a) of this Section, to the administration of estates of decedents or to any
other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect any of the rights or
remedies of Mortgagee hereunder, including the rights of Mortgagee hereunder to
a sale of the Mortgaged Property for the collection of the Secured Obligations
without any prior or different resort for collection, or to the payment of the
Secured Obligations out of the proceeds of sale of the Mortgaged Property in
preference to any other Person.

            (iii) If any statute or rule of law referred to in this
Section 6.07 and now in force, of which Mortgagor or any of its representatives,
successors or assigns and such other Persons claiming any interest in the
Property might take advantage despite this Section 6.07, shall hereafter be
repealed or cease to be in force, such statute or rule of law shall not
thereafter be deemed to preclude the application of this Section 6.07.

            (iv)  Mortgagor shall not be relieved of its obligation to pay
the Secured Obligations at the time and in the manner provided in the Loan
Documents, nor shall the lien or priority of this Mortgage or any other Loan
Document be impaired by any of the following actions, non-actions or indulgences
by Mortgagee, each of which actions, non-actions or indulgences Mortgagee may,
in its discretion, take or refrain from taking:

                  (i)   any failure or refusal by Mortgagee to comply with any
       request by Mortgagor (A) to consent to any action by Mortgagor or (B) to
       take any action to foreclose this Mortgage or otherwise enforce any of
       the provisions of the Loan Documents;

                  (ii)  any release, regardless of consideration,of the whole or
       any part of the Property or any other security for the Secured
       Obligations, or any Person liable for payment of the Secured Obligations;

                  (iii) any waiver by Mortgagee of compliance by Mortgagor with
       any provision of the Loan Documents, or consent by Mortgagee to the
       performance by Mortgagor of any action which would otherwise be
       prohibited thereunder, or to the failure by Mortgagor to take any action
       which would otherwise be required thereunder; and

                  (iv)  any agreement or stipulation between Mortgagee and
       Mortgagor, or, with or without Mortgagor's consent, between Mortgagee and
       any subsequent owner or owners of the Mortgaged Property or any other
       security for the Secured Obligations, renewing, extending or modifying
       the time of payment or the terms of the Loan Documents (including a
       modification of any interest rate), and in any such event Mortgagor shall
       continue to be obligated to pay the Secured Obligations at the time and
       in the manner provided in the Loan Documents, as so renewed, extended or
       modified, unless expressly released and discharged by Mortgagee.

            (v)   Regardless of consideration, and without the necessity for
any notice to or consent by the holder of any subordinate lien, encumbrance,
right, title or interest in or to the Property, Mortgagee may release any Person
at any time liable for the payment of the Secured Obligations or any portion
thereof or any part of the security held for the Secured Obligations and may
extend the time of payment or otherwise modify the terms of the Loan Documents,
including a modification of the interest rates payable on the principal balance
of the Notes without in any manner impairing or affecting this

<Page>

Mortgage or the lien thereof or the priority of this Mortgage, as so extended
and modified, as security for the Secured Obligations over any such subordinate
lien, encumbrance, right, title or interest. Mortgagee may resort for the
payment of the Secured Obligations to any other security held by Mortgagee in
such order and manner as Mortgagee, in its discretion, may elect. Mortgagee may
take or cause to be taken action to recover the Secured Obligations, or any
portion thereof, or to enforce any provision of the Loan Documents without
prejudice to the right of Mortgagee thereafter to foreclose or cause to be
foreclosed this Mortgage. Mortgagee shall not be limited exclusively to the
rights and remedies herein stated but shall be entitled to every additional
right and remedy now or hereafter afforded by law or equity. The rights of
Mortgagee under this Mortgage shall be separate, distinct and cumulative and
none shall be given effect to the exclusion of the others. No act of Mortgagee
shall be construed as an election to proceed under any one provision herein to
the exclusion of any other provision.

            (vi)  Mortgagor hereby waives any defense to the recovery by
Mortgagee hereunder against Mortgagor or the Mortgaged Property of any
deficiency after a nonjudicial sale. Without limiting the foregoing, Mortgagor
waives any defense arising out of any such nonjudicial sale even though such
sale operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation
or any other right or remedy of Mortgagor against Borrower or any subsidiary of
Borrower or against any collateral security.


                                  ARTICLE VII.

                                 RELEASE OF LIEN

            SECTION 7.01. Release of Lien. If all of the Secured Obligations
shall be fully satisfied, paid and performed, then and in that event only all
rights and obligations hereunder shall terminate. In such event Mortgagee shall,
at the request of Mortgagor, deliver to Mortgagor, in recordable form, all such
documents as shall be necessary to release the Mortgaged Property from the
liens, security interests, conveyances and assignments created or evidenced
hereby.


                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                              ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

            SECTION 8.01. Provisions as to Payments, Advances. (a) To the extent
that any part of the Secured Obligations is used to pay indebtedness secured by
any Permitted Encumbrance or other outstanding lien, security interest, charge
or prior encumbrance against the Mortgaged Property or to pay in whole or in
part the purchase price therefor, Mortgagee shall be subrogated to any and all
rights, security interests and liens held by any owner or holder of the same,
whether or not the same are released. Mortgagor agrees that, in consideration of
such payment by Mortgagee, effective upon such payment Mortgagor shall and
hereby does waive and release all demands, defenses and causes of action for
offsets and payments with respect to the same.

            SECTION 8.02. Separability. If all or any portion of any provision
of this Mortgage or any other Loan Documents shall be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect or in any jurisdiction, then such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
hereof or thereof, and such provision shall be limited and construed in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion
thereof were not contained herein or therein.

            SECTION 8.03. Notices. (a) Any notice, demand, consent, approval,
direction, agreement or other communication (any "NOTICE") required or permitted
hereunder shall be in writing and

<Page>

shall be validly given if delivered in accordance with Section 9.02 of the
Credit Agreement to the parties hereto at the addresses set forth above.

            SECTION 8.04. In the event that ownership of the Mortgaged Property
becomes vested in a person other than Mortgagor, Mortgagee may, without notice
to Mortgagor, deal with such successor or successors in interest with reference
to this Mortgage or the Secured Obligations in the same manner as with
Mortgagor, without in any way vitiating or discharging Mortgagor's liability
hereunder or for the payment of the Secured Obligations or being deemed a
consent to such vesting.

            SECTION 8.05. Continuation of Lease. (a) Upon the foreclosure of the
lien created hereby on the Mortgaged Property, as herein provided, any leases
then existing shall not be destroyed or terminated as a result of such
foreclosure unless Mortgagee or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale shall so
elect by notice to the lessee in question.

            (b) If both the lessor's and the lessee's interest under any lease
which constitutes a part of the Premises shall at any time become vested in any
one person, this Mortgage and the lien and security interest created hereby
shall not be destroyed or terminated by the application of the doctrine of
merger and, in such event, Mortgagee shall continue to have and enjoy all of the
rights and privileges of Mortgagee hereunder as to each separate estate.

            (c) [In the event that Mortgagor acquires the fee or any other
interest in the Leased Land, such interest shall, immediately upon such
acquisition, become subject to the lien of this Mortgage as fully and
completely, and with the same effect, as though now owned by Mortgagor and
specifically described herein, without need for the delivery and/or recording of
a supplement to this Mortgage or any other instrument.]

            SECTION 8.06. Applicable Law. This Mortgage shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the internal law of the State in which the
Mortgaged Property is located without regard to principles of conflicts of laws,
except that the internal laws of the State of New York (without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws) shall govern (i) those terms and conditions
contained in the Credit Agreement which are incorporated by reference herein and
(ii) the resolution of issues arising under the Credit Agreement to the extent

one State or county, whether by court action, foreclosure, power of sale or
otherwise, shall prejudice or in any way limit or preclude enforcement by court
action, foreclosure, power of sale or otherwise, of this Mortgage, the Loan
Documents or any Additional Mortgages through one or more additional proceedings
in that State or county or in any other State or county.
