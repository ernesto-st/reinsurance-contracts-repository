of this Section shall control. If AAA is unwilling or unable to serve as the provider of arbitration or to enforce any provision of this Section, Agent may designate another arbitration organization with similar procedures to serve as the provider
of arbitration. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in Los Angeles or Pasadena, California. The arbitration hearing shall commence within 90&nbsp;days of the arbitration demand and close within 90&nbsp;days thereafter. The arbitration
award must be issued within 30&nbsp;days after close of the hearing (subject to extension by the arbitrator for up to 60&nbsp;days upon a showing of good cause), and shall include a concise written statement of reasons for the award. The arbitrator
shall give effect to applicable statutes of limitation in determining any controversy or claim, and for these purposes, service on AAA under applicable AAA rules of a notice of claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any dispute

entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall not have the power to commit errors of law or legal reasoning, and any award may be reviewed and vacated or corrected on appeal to a
court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. The institution and maintenance of an action for judicial relief or pursuant to a provisional or ancillary remedy shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party, including the plaintiff,
to submit the controversy or claim to arbitration if any other party contests such action for judicial relief. No controversy or claim shall be submitted to arbitration without the consent of all parties if, at the time of the proposed submission,
such controversy or claim relates to an obligation secured by Real Estate, but if all parties do not consent to submission of such a controversy or claim to arbitration, it shall be determined as provided in the next sentence. At the request of any
party, a controversy or claim that is not submitted to arbitration as provided above shall be determined by judicial reference; and if such an election is made, the parties shall designate to the court a referee or referees selected under the
auspices of the AAA in the same manner as arbitrators are selected in AAA sponsored proceedings and the presiding referee of the panel (or the referee if there is a single referee) shall be an active attorney or retired judge; and judgment upon the
award rendered by such referee or referees shall be entered in the court in which proceeding was commenced. None of the foregoing provisions of this Section shall limit the right of Agent or Lenders to exercise self-help remedies, such as setoff,
foreclosure or sale of any Collateral or to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction before, after or during any arbitration proceeding. The exercise of a remedy does not waive the right of any party to resort
to arbitration or reference. At Agent&#146;s option, foreclosure under a Mortgage may be accomplished either by exercise of power of sale thereunder or by judicial foreclosure. </FONT></P> <P
