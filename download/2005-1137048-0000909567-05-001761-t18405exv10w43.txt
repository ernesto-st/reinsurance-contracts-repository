Loan") to the


                                       28

<PAGE>

Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period,
in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such
Lender's Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any
Revolving Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the Aggregate
Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of
any Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount
of all L/C Obligations, shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment. Within the

conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.1, prepay under
Section 2.4, and reborrow under this Section 2.1. Revolving Loans may be Base
Rate Loans or LIBOR Loans, as further provided herein.

     SECTION 2.2 BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF REVOLVING LOANS.

     (a) Each Revolving Borrowing, each conversion of Revolving Loans from one
Type to the other, and each continuation of LIBOR Loans shall be made upon the
Borrower's irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by
telephone. Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not

Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Loans or of any conversion
of LIBOR Loans to Base Rate Loans, and (ii) not later than 11:00 a.m. on the
requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by
the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Revolving Loan Notice,
appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.
Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof. Except as provided in Section 2.3(c), each Borrowing of or conversion
to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole
multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Revolving Loan Notice (whether

continued, (iv) the Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed or to which existing
Revolving Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the
Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of
Revolving Loan in a Revolving Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a
timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable
Revolving Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such
automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of
the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable LIBOR Loans.
If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of LIBOR
Loans in any such Revolving Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest
Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

     (b) Following receipt of a Revolving Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent
shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of
the applicable Revolving Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or
continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans
described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a Revolving Borrowing,
each Lender shall make the amount of its Revolving Loan available to the


                                       29

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Revolving Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions
set forth in Section 4.2 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit
Extension, Section 4.1), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so
received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the
Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the
books of Wachovia with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such
funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably
acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Borrower; provided, however, that
if, on the date the Revolving Loan Notice with respect to such Borrowing is
given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds
of such Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such
L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided
above.

     (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a LIBOR Loan may be continued or
converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan. During
the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or
continued as LIBOR Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders.

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for LIBOR Loans
upon determination of such interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are
outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders
of any change in Wachovia's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate
promptly following the public announcement of such change.

     (e) After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of
Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving
Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in

     aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender, plus
     such Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C
     Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment. Each request by a
     Letter of Credit Obligor for the issuance or amendment of a Letter of
     Credit shall be deemed to be a representation by such Letter


                                       30

<PAGE>

     of Credit Obligor that the L/C Credit Extension so requested complies with

     the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each
     Letter of Credit Obligor's ability to obtain Letters of Credit shall be
     fully revolving, and accordingly the Letter of Credit Obligors may, during
     the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit
     that have expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed. Each Letter
     of Credit issued for the account of any Subsidiary Obligor shall be a
     Secured Letter of Credit and shall comply with the provisions of Section
     2.3(l) hereof throughout the entire term of such Letter of Credit. Letters
     of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower may be Secured Letters of
     Credit or Unsecured Letters of Credit, at the Borrower's option. The
     Borrower may convert a Letter of Credit from one Type to the other upon
     notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.3(b)(v).

          (ii) The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:

               (A) subject to Section 2.3(b)(iii), the expiry date of such
          requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months after
          the date of issuance or last extension, unless the Required Lenders
          have approved such expiry date; or

               (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit would
          occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all the
          Lenders have approved such expiry date.

          (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any Letter
     of Credit if:

               (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
          or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C
          Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to
          the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the
          force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over
          the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain
          from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
          Credit in particular or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect
          to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital
          requirement (for which the L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated
          hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the
          L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
          applicable on the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith
          deems material to it;

               (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or
          more policies of the L/C Issuer;

               (C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and
          the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount
          less than $200,000; provided that Clearwater Select may request the
          issuance of up to four Letters of Credit in an initial stated amount
          not less than $50,000;

               (D) such Letter of Credit is to be denominated in a currency
          other than Dollars or a Foreign Currency;


                                       31

<PAGE>

               (E) such Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic
          reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder; or

               (F) a default of any Lender's obligations to fund under Section
          2.3(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting Lender
          hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into satisfactory
          arrangements with the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor or such
          Lender to eliminate the L/C Issuer's risk with respect to such Lender.

          (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C
     Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of Credit
     in its amended form under the terms hereof.

          (v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of
     Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue
     such Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B)
     the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed
     amendment to such Letter of Credit.

          (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to
     any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
     and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A)
     provided to the Administrative Agent in ARTICLE IX with respect to any acts
     taken or omissions suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of
     Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Letter of Credit
     Applications pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term
     "Administrative Agent" as used in ARTICLE IX included the L/C Issuer with
     respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein
     with respect to the L/C Issuer.

     (b) Procedures for Issuance, Conversion and Amendment of Letters of Credit;
Auto-Extension Letters of Credit.

          (i) The issuance or amendment of each Letter of Credit shall be made
     upon the request of a Letter of Credit Obligor delivered to the L/C Issuer
     (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit
     Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of
     such Letter of Credit Obligor. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
     received by the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later than
     11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the
     Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance
     in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date, date of
     amendment or date of conversion, as the case may be. In the case of a
     request for an initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of
     Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C
     Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit
     (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the expiry
     date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (E) the
     documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any drawing
     thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented by such
     beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; (G) in the case of a Letter
     of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower, the Type of Letter of
     Credit; (H)


                                       32

<PAGE>

     the Applicable Currency of such Letter of Credit; and (I) such other
     matters as the L/C Issuer may require. In the case of a request for an
     amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
     Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer
     (I) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (II) the proposed date of amendment
     thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (III) the nature of the proposed
     amendment; and (IV) such other matters as the L/C Issuer may require.
     Additionally, the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor shall furnish to the
     L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent with respect to the issuance of any
     Secured Letter of Credit an L/C Collateral Balance Report not later than
     11:00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of issuance
     confirming that the L/C Collateral Balance of such Letter of Credit Obligor
     after giving effect to the issuance of the requested Secured Letter of
     Credit is not less than the aggregate L/C Obligations of such Letter of
     Credit Obligor.

          (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit Application, the
     L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in
     writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter
     of Credit Application from the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor and, if
     not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy
     thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written notice from any Lender,
     the Administrative Agent or any Credit Party, at least one Business Day
     prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of the applicable
     Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained in
     ARTICLE IV shall not then be satisfied, then, subject to the terms and
     conditions hereof, the L/C Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a
     Letter of Credit for the account of the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor
     or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in each case in
     accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business practices.
     Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Lender shall
     be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to,
     purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit
     in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Applicable Percentage
     times the stated amount of such Letter of Credit.

          (iii) If the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor so requests in any
     applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole
     and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has
     automatic extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension Letter of
     Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit must
     permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each
     twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of
     Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a
     day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such twelve-month period to
     be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless
     otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the applicable Letter of Credit
     Obligor shall not be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer
     for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been
     issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not
     require) the L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at
     any time to an expiry date not later than the Letter of Credit Expiration
     Date; provided, however, that the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such
     extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be
     permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter
     of Credit in its revised form (as extended) under the terms hereof (by
     reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or clause (iii)


                                       33

<PAGE>

     of Section 2.3(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice (which may
     be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business
     Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the Administrative Agent
     that the Required Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (2)
     from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Letter of Credit Obligor
     that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.2 is
     not then satisfied, and in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to
     permit such extension.

          (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any
     amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or
     to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to the
     applicable Letter of Credit Obligor and the Administrative Agent a true and
     complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

          (v) The Borrower may request the conversion of a Letter of Credit
     issued for its account from one Type to another Type by delivering a L/C
     Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent (with a copy to the L/C
     Issuer), appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
     Borrower, not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days prior to the
     proposed effective date of such conversion, provided that (A) the Borrower
     shall have delivered on the Business Day immediately preceding the proposed
     date of conversion an L/C Collateral Balance Report confirming that the L/C
     Collateral Balance of the Borrower after giving effect to the conversion of
     the requested Letter of Credit is not less than the aggregate L/C
     Obligations of the Borrower and (B) the L/C Issuer shall not have received
     notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the proposed
     date of conversion from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Credit
     Party that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section
     4.2 is not then satisfied.

     (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

          (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any
     notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
     notify the Letter of Credit Obligor that requested the issuance of such
     Letter of Credit and the Administrative Agent thereof. Not later than 11:00
     a.m. on the date of any payment by the L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit
     (each such date, an "Honor Date"), such Letter of Credit Obligor shall
     reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount in
     Dollars equal to the Dollar Amount of such drawing. If such Letter of
     Credit Obligor fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the
     Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Honor Date,
     the Dollar Amount of the unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Amount"),
     and the amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. In such
     event, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing
     of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in a Dollar Amount
     equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and
     multiples specified in Section 2.2 for the principal amount of Base Rate
     Loans, but subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Aggregate
     Commitments and the conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than the
     delivery of a Revolving Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or
     the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.3(c)(i) may be given by
     telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of


                                       34

<PAGE>

     such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or
     binding effect of such notice.

          (ii) Each Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i)
     make funds in Dollars available to the Administrative Agent for the account
     of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in a Dollar Amount
     equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not later
     than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
     Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
     2.3(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to
     have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such Dollar Amount. The
     Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

          (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully
     refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the
     conditions set forth in Section 4.2 cannot be satisfied or for any other
     reason, the Letter of Credit Obligor for whose account such Letter of
     Credit was issued shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer an
     L/C Borrowing in the Dollar Amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not
     so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand in
     Dollars (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default
     Rate. In such event, each Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent for
     the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be
     deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and
     shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its
     participation obligation under this Section 2.3.

          (iv) Until each Lender funds its Revolving Loan or L/C Advance
     pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount
     drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's
     Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of the
     L/C Issuer.

          (v) Each Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances
     to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as
     contemplated by this Section 2.3(c), shall be absolute and unconditional
     and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,
     counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
     against the L/C Issuer, any Credit Party or any other Person for any reason
     whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or (C) any
     other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the
     foregoing; provided, however, that each Lender's obligation to make
     Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.3(c) is subject to the
     conditions set forth in Section 4.2 (other than delivery by the Borrower of
     a Revolving Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
     otherwise impair the obligation of such Letter of Credit Obligor to
     reimburse the L/C Issuer for the Dollar Amount of any payment made by the
     L/C Issuer under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided
     herein.

          (vi) If any Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent
     for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such
     Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.3(c) by the
     time specified in Section 2.3(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to
     recover from such Lender (acting through the


                                       35

<PAGE>

     Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the
     period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such
     payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum
     equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
     L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
     compensation. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender
     (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under
     this clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          (vii) Without limiting any other obligations of any of the Credit
     Parties hereunder, each Letter of Credit Obligor hereby agrees to indemnify
     each Lender in respect of any Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign
     Currency issued for its account for any and all costs, expenses and losses
     reasonably incurred by such Lender as a result of receiving payment or
     reimbursement for any disbursement thereunder from any Person in a currency
     other than Dollars. Any such amount payable to any Lender shall be payable
     within 10 days after demand by the Administrative Agent.

     (d) Repayment of Participations.

          (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under any
     Letter of Credit and has received from any Lender such Lender's L/C Advance
     in respect of such payment in accordance with Section 2.3(c), if the
     Administrative Agent receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment
     in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or interest thereon (whether
     directly from the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor or otherwise,
     including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Administrative
     Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such Lender its
     Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately adjusted, in the case of
     interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's
     L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the
     Administrative Agent.

          (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.3(c)(i) is required to be
     returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 10.5
     (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in its
     discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
     account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of
     the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such
     demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a rate per
     annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The
     obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in
     full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

     (e) Obligations Absolute. The obligation of each Letter of Credit Obligor
to reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit issued
for such Letter of Credit Obligor's account and the obligation of each Letter of
Credit Obligor to repay the L/C Borrowing with respect to each Letter of Credit
issued for such Letter of Credit Obligor's account shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including the following:


                                       36

<PAGE>

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of Credit,
     this Agreement, or any other Loan Document;

          (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or
     other right that any Letter of Credit Obligor may have at any time against
     any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person
     for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the
     L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement,
     the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any
     agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

          (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under
     such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or
     otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such
     Letter of Credit;

          (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against
     presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with
     the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the L/C Issuer
     under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in
     bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
     liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any
     beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any
     arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law; or

          (v) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
     similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
     might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any
     Letter of Credit Obligor.

The Letter of Credit Obligor shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of
Credit issued for its account and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it
and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Letter of Credit
Obligor's instructions or other irregularity, the Letter of Credit Obligor will
immediately notify the L/C Issuer. Such Letter of Credit Obligor shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

     (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Lender and each Letter of Credit Obligor
agrees that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer
shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight
draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or
to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or
the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. Neither
the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related
Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall
be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection
herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the Required
Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness,
validity or enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. Each Letter of Credit Obligor hereby
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of


                                       37

<PAGE>

any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not,
preclude each Letter of Credit Obligor from pursuing such rights and remedies as
it may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. Neither the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their
respective Related Parties nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the
L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in
clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.3(e); provided, however, that anything in
such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding, a Letter of Credit Obligor may
have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the L/C Issuer may be liable to a
Letter of Credit Obligor, to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct,
as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by a Letter of Credit
Obligor which such Letter of Credit Obligor proves were caused by the L/C
Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful
failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face
to be in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of
any notice or information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a Letter of Credit or the rights
or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove
to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

     (g) Cash or Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
(i) if, an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (ii) if, as of 7
days prior to the Maturity Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason remains
outstanding, the Letter of Credit Obligors shall, in each case, immediately (A)
Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations or (B)
otherwise fully secure the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations by
delivering to the Custodian L/C Collateral in an amount equal to the Collateral
Value of such L/C Collateral multiplied by the Collateral Coverage Percentage
for such type of L/C Collateral. Section 2.4 and Section 8.2(c) set forth
certain additional requirements to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For
purposes of this Section 2.3, Section 2.4 and Section 8.2(c), "Cash
Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with or deliver to the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Lenders, as collateral for the
L/C Obligations, cash or deposit account balances pursuant to documentation in
form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer
(which documents are hereby consented to by the Lenders); provided that such
cash shall be multiplied by the applicable Collateral Coverage Percentage.
Derivatives of such term have corresponding meanings. The Letter of Credit
Obligors hereby grant to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
Issuer and the Lenders, a security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts
and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing. Cash Collateral of
each Letter of Credit Obligor shall be maintained in a separate blocked,
non-interest bearing deposit account at Wachovia.

     (h) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the L/C
Issuer and the Letter of Credit Obligor when a Letter of Credit is issued, the
rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.

     (i) Letter of Credit Fees. Each Letter of Credit Obligor shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender in accordance with its
Applicable Percentage a fee (collectively, the "Letter of Credit Fee") (i) for
each Secured Letter of Credit


                                       38

<PAGE>

issued for such Letter of Credit Obligor's account equal to 0.275% per annum
times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such Secured Letter
of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
Letter of Credit) (the "Secured Letter of Credit Fee"), and (ii) for each
Unsecured Letter of Credit issued for the Borrower's account equal to the
Applicable Rate for LIBOR Loans times the average daily stated amount available
to be drawn under such Unsecured Letter of Credit (the "Unsecured Letter of
Credit Fee"). For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn
under any Letter of Credit, the Dollar Amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
determined in accordance with Section 1.6. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i)
computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the last
Business Day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the first such date to
occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit
Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any change in the
Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under
each Unsecured Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the
Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such
Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of
Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. For
purposes of calculating the Letter of Credit Fee, for any day that there is a
Collateral Deficiency with respect to a Secured Letter of Credit such Secured
Letter of Credit will be deemed to be an Unsecured Letter of Credit on such day.

     (j) Facing Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C
Issuer. Each Letter of Credit Obligor shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for
its own account a facing fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate
per annum specified in the Fee Letter, computed on the daily amount available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit and on a quarterly basis in arrears, and
due and payable on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with
the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of
computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the
amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section
1.6. In addition, each Letter of Credit Obligor shall pay directly to the L/C
Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and
other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of the L/C Issuer
relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary
fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are
nonrefundable.

     (k) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

     (l) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiary Obligors. Notwithstanding that
a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder may be in support of any
Obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary Obligor, the Borrower
shall be jointly and severally obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letters of Credit. The
Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the
account of any Subsidiary Obligor inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and
that the Borrower's business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of
such Subsidiary Obligors. The joint and several obligation of the Borrower under
this Section 2.3(l) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall remain in full
force and effect until the entire Obligations shall have been paid, and, until
such payment has been made, shall not be discharged, affected, modified or


                                       39

<PAGE>

impaired on the occurrence from time to time of any event, including, without
limitation, any of the following, whether or not with notice to or the consent
of any Credit Party:

          (i) the waiver, compromise, settlement, release, termination or
     amendment (including, without limitation, any extension or postponement of
     the time for payment or performance or renewal or refinancing) of any or
     all of the Obligations of any of the Credit Parties under any Loan
     Document;

          (ii) the failure to give notice to any or all of the Credit Parties of
     a Default or an Event of Default under any Loan Document;

          (iii) the release, substitution or exchange by the Administrative
     Agent or the Lenders of any L/C Collateral or Cash Collateral securing any
     of the Obligations (whether with or without consideration) or the
     acceptance by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of any additional
     collateral or the availability or claimed availability of any other
     collateral or source of repayment or any nonperfection or impairment of any
     collateral;

          (iv) the release of any Person primarily or secondarily liable for all
     or any part of the Obligations, whether by the Administrative Agent or the
     Lenders or in connection with any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
     dissolution, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the
     benefit of creditors or similar event or proceeding affecting any or all of
     the Credit Parties or any other Person who, or any of whose property, shall
     at the time in question be obligated in respect of the Obligations or any
     part thereof; or

          (v) to the extent permitted by law, any other event, occurrence,
     action or circumstance that would, in the absence of this clause (v),
     result in the release or discharge of the Borrower from the performance or
     observance of any Obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this
     Agreement.

     The joint and several obligations of the Borrower to the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders under this Section 2.3(l) shall remain in full force and effect (or be
reinstated) until the L/C Issuer and the Lenders have received payment in full
of all Obligations and the expiration of any applicable preference or similar
period pursuant to any proceeding under Debtor Relief Laws, without any claim
having been made before the expiration of such period asserting an interest in
all or any part of any payments received by the L/C Issuer or any Lender.

     The Borrower expressly agrees that (x) the L/C Issuer or the Lenders shall
not be required first to institute any suit or to exhaust its remedies against
any of the Subsidiary Obligors or any other Person or against any Collateral to
become liable hereunder, in order to enforce the obligations of the Borrower
under this Section 2.3(l) and (y) notwithstanding the occurrence of any of the
foregoing, the Borrower shall be and remain directly and primarily liable for
all sums due under each Letter of Credit issued for the account of any
Subsidiary Obligor. On disposition by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders of
any Collateral to satisfy the Obligations, the Borrower shall be and shall
remain jointly and severally liable for any deficiency.


                                       40

     (m) Secured Letters of Credit.

          (i) Prior to the issuance of any Secured Letter of Credit, the
     applicable Letter of Credit Obligor shall have pledged and deposited with
     or delivered to the Custodian for deposit in its Custodial Account L/C
     Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents so that the L/C Collateral
     Balance of the applicable Letter of Credit Obligor shall not be less than
     the aggregate L/C Obligations attributable to such Letter of Credit Obligor
     after giving effect to such issuance; provided that no L/C Collateral
     (including, without limitation, cash) shall be included in the calculation
     of the L/C Collateral Balance of such Letter of Credit Obligor unless the
     Administrative Agent has a first lien perfected Lien on and security
     interest in such L/C Collateral. Each Letter of Credit Obligor hereby
     grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and
     the Lenders, a security interest in all L/C Collateral and all proceeds of
     the foregoing to secure all obligations of such Letter of Credit Obligor
     hereunder in respect of Secured Letters of Credit issued for its account.

          (ii) If, at any time, (A) the L/C Collateral Balance for any Letter of
     Credit Obligor is less than the aggregate L/C Obligations attributable to
     such Letter of Credit Obligor (a "Collateral Deficiency"), such Letter of
     Credit Obligor shall no later than 14 days from the date of notice thereof
     by the Administrative Agent, pledge additional L/C Collateral to cure such
     Collateral Deficiency, provided that until such Collateral Deficiency is
     cured, such Letter of Credit Obligor may not request any Letters of Credit
     to be issued, extended or amended for its account. If such Letter of Credit
     Obligor fails to pledge additional L/C Collateral to cure its Collateral
     Deficiency within the time provided above, the Administrative Agent may
     immediately (A) designate such Secured Letter of Credit an Unsecured Letter
     of Credit and (B) exercise its rights and remedies set forth in Section
     8.2(b) hereof, including without limitation, liquidating all or part of the
     L/C Collateral.

     SECTION 2.4 PREPAYMENTS.

     (a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time
or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans in whole or in part
without premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by
the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three Business Days prior
to any date of prepayment of LIBOR Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of
Base Rate Loans; (ii) any prepayment of LIBOR Loans shall be in a principal
amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and
(iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if
less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice
shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of
Revolving Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify
each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such
Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by
the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.
Any prepayment of a LIBOR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on
the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required


                                       41

<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 3.5. Each such prepayment shall be applied to the Revolving
Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

     (b) If for any reason the Total Outstandings at any time exceed the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay
Revolving Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate
amount equal to such excess; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be
required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section
2.4(b) unless after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans the Total
Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

     SECTION 2.5 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS. The Borrower may, upon
notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from
time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided that (i) any
such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00
a.m. five Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any
such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) the Borrower shall not
terminate or reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto
and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed
the Aggregate Commitments. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
Lenders of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate
Commitments. Any reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the
Commitment of each Lender according to such Lender's Applicable Percentage. All
fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate
Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.

     SECTION 2.6 REPAYMENT OF REVOLVING LOANS. The Borrower shall repay to the
Lenders on the Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans
outstanding on such date.

     SECTION 2.7 INTEREST.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each LIBOR Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each
Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR for such Interest Period plus
the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate Revolving Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date
at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

     (b) (i) If any amount of principal of any Revolving Loan is not paid when
due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

          (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Revolving Loan)
     payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due
     (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated
     maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the
     Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
     fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate
     to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.


                                       42

<PAGE>

          (iii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of
     Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of
     all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per
     annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent
     permitted by applicable Laws.

          (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including
     interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

     (c) Interest on each Revolving Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

     SECTION 2.8 FEES. In addition to certain fees described in subsections (i)
and (j) of Section 2.3:

     (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a
commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to the Applicable Rate for such fee
times the actual daily amount by which the Aggregate Commitments exceed the
Total Outstandings. The Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the
Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in ARTICLE IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date, and on the
Maturity Date.

     (b) Utilization Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of each Lender, a utilization fee (the "Utilization Fee")
payable for each day that the aggregate Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans is
greater than 50% of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect (or, if terminated,
in effect immediately prior to such termination), including at any time during
which one or more of the conditions in Section 4.2 is not met. The Utilization
Fee shall be computed at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Percentage in
effect for such fee from time to time on such Lender's Applicable Percentage of
the average daily Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans. The Utilization Fee
shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
calendar quarter, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing
Date through the Maturity Date.

     (c) Other Fees.

          (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger, the L/C Issuer and the
     Administrative Agent, for their own respective accounts, fees in the
     amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be
     fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason
     whatsoever.

          (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have
     been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so
     specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be
     refundable for any reason whatsoever.


                                       43

<PAGE>

     SECTION 2.9 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Wachovia's "prime rate"
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest shall be made
on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more
fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a
365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Revolving Loan for the day on which
the Revolving Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion
thereof, for the day on which the Revolving Loan or such portion is paid,
provided that any Revolving Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is
made shall, subject to Section 2.11(a), bear interest for one day. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

     SECTION 2.10 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

     (a) The Revolving Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or
more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative
Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by
the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error as to the amount of the Revolving Loans made by the Lenders to the
Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any
error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation
of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall
evidence such Lender's Revolving Loans in addition to such accounts or records.
Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type
(if applicable), amount and maturity of its Revolving Loans and payments with
respect thereto.

     (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in subsection (a),
each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such
Lender of participations in Letters of Credit. In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the
accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest
error.

     SECTION 2.11 PAYMENTS GENERALLY; ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S CLAWBACK.

     (a) General. All payments to be made by the Credit Parties shall be made
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or
setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the
Credit Parties hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the
Administrative Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not
later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will
promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other
applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received
by wire transfer to such Lender's Lending Office. All


                                       44

<PAGE>

payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be deemed
received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee
shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by any Credit Party shall
come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next
following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in
computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

     (b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.

          (i) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
     Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such
     Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's
     share of such Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that
     such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
     Section 2.2 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
     the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in
     fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the
     Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally
     agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
     corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon,
     for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to
     the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative
     Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the
     greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the
     Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
     compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower,
     the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such
     Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or
     an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
     Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period.
     If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing to the
     Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such
     Lender's Revolving Loan included in such Revolving Borrowing. Any payment
     by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may
     have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the
     Administrative Agent.

          (ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.
     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from any Credit
     Party prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
     Agent for the account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that such
     Credit Party will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
     assume that such Credit Party has made such payment on such date in
     accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute
     to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount due. In
     such event, if such Credit Party has not in fact made such payment, then
     each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees
     to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
     distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available
     funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
     amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
     Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate
     determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
     rules on interbank compensation.


                                       45

<PAGE>

     A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or any Credit Party with
respect to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

     (c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available
to the Administrative Agent funds for any Revolving Loan to be made by such
Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this ARTICLE II, and such
funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because
the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in ARTICLE IV are
not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative
Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
such Lender, without interest.

     (d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders
hereunder to make Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit
and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.4(c) are several and not joint. The
failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan, to fund any such participation
or to make any payment under Section 10.4(c) on any date required hereunder
shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on
such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Lender to so make its Revolving Loan, to purchase its participation or to make
its payment under Section 10.4(c).

     (e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender
to obtain the funds for any Revolving Loan in any particular place or manner or
to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Revolving Loan in any particular place or manner.

     SECTION 2.12 SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Revolving Loans made by
it, or the participations in L/C Obligations held by it resulting in such
Lender's receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such
Revolving Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its
Applicable Percentage thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such
greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and
(b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and
subparticipations in L/C Obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments
shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their Applicable
Percentage, provided that:

          (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and
     all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
     participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase
     price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

          (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to
     (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
     express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as
     consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of
     its Revolving Loans or subparticipations


                                       46

<PAGE>

     in L/C Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to the
     Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this
     Section shall apply).

The Credit Parties consent to the foregoing and agree that any Lender acquiring
a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may, to the extent such
Lender may effectively do so under applicable law, exercise against such Credit
Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the
amount of such participation.

     SECTION 2.13 INCREASE IN COMMITMENTS.

     (a) Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Default, upon notice to
the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders), the Borrower
may from time to time, request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an
amount (for all such requests) not exceeding $50,000,000; provided that (i) any
such request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 and
(ii) immediately after giving effect to any such increase, (y) the Aggregate
Commitments shall not exceed $200,000,000 and (z) the aggregate amount of all
increases effected under this Section 2.13 shall not exceed $50,000,000. At the
time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the
Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is
requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten Business Days
from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).

     (b) Lender Elections to Increase. Each Lender shall notify the
Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to
increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than,
or less than its Applicable Percentage of such requested increase. Any Lender
not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to
increase its Commitment.

     (c) Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders'
responses to each request made hereunder. To achieve the full amount of a
requested increase and subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and
the L/C Issuer (which approvals shall not be unreasonably withheld), the
Borrower may also invite additional Eligible Assignees to become Lenders
pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and its counsel.

     (d) Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are
increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower shall determine the effective date (the "Increase Effective Date") and
the final allocation of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and
the Increase Effective Date.

     (e) Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to
such increase, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a
certificate of each Credit Party dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in
sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by a Responsible Officer of such
Credit Party (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by such Credit
Party approving or consenting to such increase, and (ii) in the case of the
Borrower,


                                       47

<PAGE>

certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the
representations and warranties contained in ARTICLE V and the other Loan
Document which are qualified as to materiality are true and correct, and the
representations and warranties which are not qualified as to materiality are
true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of the
Increase Effective Date, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true
and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.13, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a)
and (b) of Section 5.5 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements
furnished pursuant to clauses (a) and (b), respectively, of Section 6.1, and (B)
no Default exists. The Borrower shall prepay any Revolving Loans outstanding on
the Increase Effective Date (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.5) to the extent necessary to keep the outstanding Revolving Loans
ratable with any revised Applicable Percentages arising from any nonratable
increase in the Commitments under this Section.

     (f) Conflicting Provisions. This Section shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.12 or Section 10.1 to the contrary.

     SECTION 2.14 ADDITION OF SUBSIDIARY OBLIGORS. The Borrower may from time to
time after the Closing Date designate one or more Subsidiaries as an additional
Subsidiary Obligor, provided such Subsidiaries are reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent. The effective date of any designation of an additional
Subsidiary Obligor shall be the date upon which each of the conditions set forth
in Section 4.2 and the following terms and conditions shall have been satisfied
or waived with respect to such Subsidiary, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (the "Designation Date"):

          (i) On or prior to the applicable Designation Date, each such Person
     shall enter into an appropriately completed Assumption Agreement; and

          (ii) On or prior to the applicable Designation Date, the
     Administrative Agent shall have received from such Person, (A) the items
     required to be delivered under Section 4.1(a) with respect to such Person
     in substantially the same form delivered to the Administrative Agent on the
     Closing Date and the substance of such items to be reasonably satisfactory
     to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (B) such other information
     and documents as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

     SECTION 3.1 TAXES.

     (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Credit Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if any Credit Party shall be
required by applicable law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other
Taxes) from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative
Agent, Lender or


                                       48

<PAGE>

the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the applicable Credit Party
shall make such deductions and (iii) the applicable Credit Party shall timely
pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

     (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions
of subsection (a) above, the Credit Parties shall timely pay any Other Taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

     (c) Indemnification by the Credit Parties. Each Credit Party shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10
days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on
or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) paid by the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and any
penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
applicable Credit Party by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental
Authority, such Credit Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

     (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which
the Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such
jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed
and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In
addition, any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender
is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower
is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but
only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the
following is applicable:


                                       49

<PAGE>

          (i) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN
     claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the
     United States is a party,

          (ii) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

          (iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the
     exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a
     certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a "bank"
     within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a "10 percent
     shareholder" of the Borrower within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of
     the Code, or (C) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in section
     881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue
     Service Form W-8BEN, or

          (iv) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for
     claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding
     tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be
     prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the
     withholding or deduction required to be made.

     (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any Lender
or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a
refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any
Credit Party or with respect to which any Credit Party has paid additional
amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to such Credit Party an amount
equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or
additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to the
Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket
expenses of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case
may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that such Credit
Party, upon the request of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Credit Party (plus any
penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the
event the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer is required to
repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be
construed to require the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to
make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes
that it deems confidential) to any Credit Party or any other Person.

     SECTION 3.2 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund LIBOR
Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon LIBOR, or any
Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of
such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars in the London
interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
LIBOR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Loans shall be suspended
until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of
such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender


                                       50

<PAGE>

(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all
LIBOR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the
Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
LIBOR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such LIBOR Loans. Upon any such prepayment or conversion,
the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or
converted.

     SECTION 3.3 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders determine
that for any reason in connection with any request for a LIBOR Loan or a
conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits are not being
offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable
amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Loan, (b) adequate and reasonable means
do not exist for determining LIBOR for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan, or (c) LIBOR for any requested Interest Period
with respect to a proposed LIBOR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Loan, the Administrative Agent will
promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of
the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such
notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request
for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR Loans or, failing
that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

     SECTION 3.4 INCREASED COSTS.

     (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall

          (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit,
     compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of,
     deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in
     by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section
     3.4(e)) or the L/C Issuer;

          (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any tax of any kind
     whatsoever with respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any
     participation in a Letter of Credit or any LIBOR Loan made by it, or change
     the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in
     respect thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by
     Section 3.1 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any
     Excluded Tax payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or

          (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London interbank
     market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or
     LIBOR Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation
     therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation
to make any such LIBOR Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the L/C
Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of
maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit),
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, or the
L/C


                                       51

<PAGE>

Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then upon
request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay to such Lender
or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

     (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines that
any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending Office
of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any,
regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate
of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Revolving Loans made by, or
participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of
Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or
the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or
such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

     (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the L/C
Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender
or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 10 days after receipt thereof.

     (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the
L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's right
to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than
nine months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case
may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof).

     (e) Reserves on LIBOR Loans. The Borrower shall pay to each Lender, as long
as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to
liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency funds or deposits
(currently known as "Eurocurrency liabilities"), additional interest on the
unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan equal to the actual costs of such
reserves allocated to such LIBOR Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which shall be
due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such LIBOR Loan,
provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days' prior notice (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest from such Lender.
If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant


                                       52

<PAGE>

Interest Payment Date, such additional interest shall be due and payable 10 days
from receipt of such notice.

     SECTION 3.5 COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly
compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or
expense incurred by it as a result of:

     (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Loan
on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan
(whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or
otherwise);

     (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of
such Lender to make a Revolving Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any
LIBOR Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or

     (c) any assignment of a LIBOR Loan on a day other than the last day of the
Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 10.13;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such LIBOR
Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged
by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.5, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each LIBOR Loan
made by it at LIBOR for such LIBOR Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing
in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a
comparable period, whether or not such LIBOR Loan was in fact so funded.

     SECTION 3.6 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

     (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 3.4, or the Borrower is required to pay any
additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.2, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different Lending Office for funding or booking its Revolving Loans hereunder or
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.1
or Section 3.4, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the
notice pursuant to Section 3.2, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not
subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

     (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.4, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any


                                       53

<PAGE>

Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1,
the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 10.13.

     SECTION 3.7 SURVIVAL. All of the obligations of the Credit Parties under
this ARTICLE III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV

to an Unsecured Letter of Credit) is subject to the following conditions
precedent:

     (a) The representations and warranties of each Credit Party contained in
ARTICLE V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document
furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith which are

be true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of the date
of such Credit Extension, except to the extent that such representations and
warranties specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be
true and correct as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes of this

                                   ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

ownership, lease or operation of properties or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification or license, and (d) is in compliance with all Laws;
except in each case referred to in clause (b)(i), (c) or (d), to the extent that
failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 5.2 AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and

organizational action, and do not and will not (a) contravene the terms of any

or (c) violate any Law. Such Credit Party and each Subsidiary thereof is in
compliance with all Contractual Obligations referred to in clause (b)(i), except
to the extent that failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.3 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION; OTHER CONSENTS. No approval,
consent, exemption, authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is necessary or required in

     SECTION 5.4 BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement has been, and each other Loan
Document to which such Credit Party is a party, when delivered hereunder, will
have been, duly executed and delivered by such Credit Party. This Agreement

Credit Party, enforceable against such Credit Party in accordance with its

     SECTION 5.5 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

     (a) The Audited Financial Statements (i) were prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as
otherwise expressly noted therein; (ii) fairly present the financial condition
of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their results of
operations for the period covered thereby in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein; and (iii) show all material indebtedness and other liabilities,
direct or contingent, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries as of the date
thereof, including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and Indebtedness.

     (b) The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries dated June 30, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
income or operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal quarter
ended on that date (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise expressly
noted therein, and (ii) fairly present the financial condition of the Borrower


                                       58

<PAGE>

and its Subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their results of operations for
the period covered thereby, subject, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), to the
absence of footnotes and to normal year-end audit adjustments. Schedule 5.5 sets
forth all material indebtedness and other liabilities, direct or contingent, of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date of such financial
statements, including liabilities for taxes, material commitments and
Indebtedness.

     (c) The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Administrative Agent
copies of the Annual Statements of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2004, and the Quarterly Statements of each of the Insurance
Subsidiaries as of June 30, 2005, each as filed with the relevant Insurance
Regulatory Authority (collectively, the "Historical Statutory Statements"). The
Historical Statutory Statements (including, without limitation, the provisions
made therein for investments and the valuation thereof, reserves, policy and
contract claims and statutory liabilities) have been prepared in accordance with
Statutory Accounting Practices, were in compliance with applicable Requirements
of Law when filed and present fairly the financial condition of the respective
Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby as of the respective dates thereof and
the results of operations, changes in capital and surplus and cash flow of the
respective Insurance Subsidiaries covered thereby for the respective periods
then ended. Except for liabilities and obligations disclosed or provided for in
the Historical Statutory Statements (including, without limitation, reserves,
policy and contract claims and statutory liabilities), no Insurance Subsidiary
had, as of the date of its respective Historical Statutory Statements, any
material liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute,
contingent or otherwise and whether or not due) that, in accordance with
Statutory Accounting Practices, would have been required to have been disclosed
or provided for in such Historical Statutory Statements. All books of account of
each Insurance Subsidiary fully and fairly disclose all of its material
transactions, properties, assets, investments, liabilities, and obligations, are
in its possession and are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

     (d) Since the date of the Audited Financial Statements, there has been no
event or circumstance, either individually or in the aggregate, that has had or
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.6 LITIGATION. There are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims or
disputes pending or, to the knowledge of such Credit Party after due and
diligent investigation, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in
arbitration or before any Governmental Authority, by or against such Credit
Party or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of their properties or revenues
that (a) purport to affect or pertain to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) either
individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.7 NO DEFAULT. Neither such Credit Party nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation
that could, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing or
would result from the consummation by such Credit Party of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

     SECTION 5.8 OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY; LIENS. Each of such Credit Party and
each of its Subsidiaries has good record and marketable title in fee simple to,
or valid leasehold interests in,


                                       59

<PAGE>

all real property necessary or used in the ordinary conduct of its business,
except for such defects in title as could not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The property of such
Credit Party and its Subsidiaries is subject to no Liens, other than Liens
permitted by Section 7.1.

     SECTION 5.9 INSURANCE. The properties of such Credit Party and its
Subsidiaries are insured with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies not Affiliates of the Borrower, in such amounts, with such deductibles
and covering such risks as are customarily carried by companies engaged in
similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where such Credit
Party or the applicable Subsidiary operates, except as could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.10 TAXES. Such Credit Party and its Subsidiaries have filed all
Federal, state and other material tax returns and reports required to be filed,
and have paid all Federal, state and other material taxes, assessments, fees and
other governmental charges levied or imposed upon them or their properties,
income or assets otherwise due and payable, except those which are being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted and for
which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance with GAAP or Statutory
Accounting Practices, as applicable. There is no proposed tax assessment against
such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries that would, if made, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.10, neither any
Credit Party nor any Subsidiary thereof is party to any tax sharing agreement.

     SECTION 5.11 ERISA COMPLIANCE.

     (a) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other Federal or state Laws. Each Plan that is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or an application for such a letter is
currently being processed by the IRS with respect thereto and, to the best
knowledge of such Credit Party, nothing has occurred which would prevent, or
cause the loss of, such qualification. The Borrower and each ERISA Affiliate has
made all required contributions to each Plan of such Credit Party subject to
Section 412 of the Code, and no application for a funding waiver or an extension
of any amortization period pursuant to Section 412 of the Code has been made
with respect to any Plan.

     (b) There are no pending or, to the best knowledge of such Credit Party,
threatened claims, actions or lawsuits, or action by any Governmental Authority,
with respect to any Plan that could be reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or violation of the
fiduciary responsibility rules with respect to any Plan that has resulted or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (c) (i) No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur;
(ii) no Pension Plan has (x) failed to meet the minimum funding requirements of
Section 412 of the Code or (y) any Unfunded Pension Liability that could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to incur,
any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Pension Plan (other
than premiums due and not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA); (iv) neither


                                       60

<PAGE>

the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred, or reasonably expects to
incur, any liability (and no event has occurred which, with the giving of notice
under Section 4219 of ERISA, would result in such liability) under Sections 4201
or 4243 of ERISA with respect to a Multiemployer Plan; and (v) neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be
subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA.

Credit Party has no Subsidiaries other than those specifically disclosed in Part
(a) of Schedule 5.12, and all of the outstanding Equity Interests in such
Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are
owned by such Credit Party in the amounts specified on Part (a) of Schedule 5.12
free and clear of all Liens. Other than (i) stock and other instruments traded
on national exchanges and (ii) equity investments in a corporation or an entity
totaling less than 10% of outstanding Equity Interests of such corporation or
entity, such Credit Party has no equity investments in any other corporation or
entity other than those specifically disclosed in Part (b) of Schedule 5.12. All
of the outstanding Equity Interests in such Credit Party have been validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.

     SECTION 5.13 MARGIN REGULATIONS; INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT.

     (a) Such Credit Party is not engaged and will not engage, principally or as
one of such Credit Party's important activities, in the business of purchasing
or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U issued by the FRB),
or extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock.
Following the application of the proceeds of each Borrowing or drawing under
each Letter of Credit, not more than 25% of the value of the assets (either of
such Credit Party only or of such Credit Party and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis) subject to the provisions of Section 7.1 or Section 7.6 or
subject to any restriction contained in any agreement or instrument between such
Credit Party and any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender relating to
Indebtedness and within the scope of Section 8.1(e) will be margin stock.

     (b) None of such Credit Party, any Person Controlling such Credit Party, or
any Subsidiary of such Credit Party (i) is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of
a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," within the meaning of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, or (ii) is or is required to be registered
as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

     SECTION 5.14 DISCLOSURE. No report, financial statement, certificate or
other information furnished (whether in writing or orally) by or on behalf of
such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and the
negotiation of this Agreement or delivered hereunder or under any other Loan
Document to which such Credit Party or such Subsidiary is a party (in each case,
as modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) contains any
material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to


                                       61

<PAGE>

projected financial information, such Credit Party represents only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time.

     SECTION 5.15 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each of such Credit Party and each of
its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements
of all Laws (including Environmental Laws) and all orders, writs, injunctions
and decrees applicable to it or to its properties, except in such instances in
which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted or (b)
the failure to comply therewith, either individually or in the aggregate, could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.16 SOLVENT. Such Credit Party is, and such Credit Party and its
Subsidiaries are on a consolidated basis, Solvent.

     SECTION 5.17 LICENSES. Schedule 5.17 lists, with respect to such Credit
Party or any Subsidiary of such Credit Party that is an Insurance Subsidiary, as
of the Closing Date, all of the jurisdictions in which such Credit Party or such
Subsidiary holds licenses (including, without limitation, licenses or
certificates of authority from relevant Insurance Regulatory Authorities),
permits or authorizations to transact insurance and reinsurance business
(collectively, the "Licenses"), and indicates the line or lines of insurance in
which each such Credit Party is permitted to be engaged with respect to each
License therein listed. No License, the loss of which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, is the subject of proceeding for
suspension, revocation or limitation or any similar proceedings. To such Credit
Party's knowledge, there is no sustainable basis for such a suspension,
revocation or limitation, and no such suspension, revocation or limitation is
threatened by any relevant Insurance Regulatory Authority. None of such Credit
Party nor any of its Subsidiaries transacts as of the Closing Date any insurance
business, directly or indirectly, in any jurisdiction other than those listed on
Schedule 5.18 with respect to such Credit Party or such Subsidiary, where such
business requires any license, permit or other authorization of an Insurance
Regulatory Authority of such jurisdiction, where such conduct could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.18 REINSURANCE AGREEMENTS.

     (a) Except as set forth on Schedule F to the Annual Statements for the
Insurance Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004 as updated
by Schedule F to the June 30, 2005 financial statements, there are no material
liabilities outstanding as of the Closing Date under any Reinsurance Agreement
to which such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. (i) Each
Reinsurance Agreement to which such Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a
Party is in full force and effect; (ii) none of such Credit Party or such
Subsidiary or, to the knowledge of such Credit Party, any other party thereto,
is in breach of or default under any such contract; and (iii) such Credit Party
or such Subsidiary has no reason to believe that the financial condition of any
other party to any such contract is impaired such that a default thereunder by
such party could reasonably be anticipated, except to the extent in the case of
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) immediately preceding where such failure to be in
full force or effect or such breach or default could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each
Reinsurance Agreement to which such Credit Party or such Subsidiary is a


                                       62

<PAGE>

party is qualified under all applicable Requirements of Law to receive the
statutory credit assigned to such Reinsurance Agreement in the relevant Annual
or Quarterly Statement at the time prepared, except where the failure to be so
qualified could not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.18, as of June
30, 2005, each Person to whom such Credit Party or such Subsidiary has ceded any
material liability pursuant to any Reinsurance Agreement to which such Credit
Party is a party on the Closing Date either: (i) had a rating of "A-" or better

Party of the type and in an amount described in Schedule 5.18.

Agreements or Insurance Agreements between such Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates (other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.)

Subsidiary, such Credit Party has no reinsured obligations under any Surplus
Relief Reinsurance Agreement.

     SECTION 5.19 OFAC; ANTI-TERRORISM LAWS.

     (a) None of such Credit Party or any Subsidiary of such Credit Party (i) is
a Sanctioned Person, (ii) has more than 15% of its assets in Sanctioned
Countries, or (iii) derives more than 15% of its operating income from
investments in, or transactions with, Sanctioned Persons or Sanctioned
Countries. No part of the proceeds of any Credit Extension hereunder will be
used directly or indirectly by such Credit Party or Subsidiary to fund any
operations in, finance any investments or activities in or make any payments to,
a Sanctioned Person or a Sanctioned Country.

     (b) Neither the making of the Revolving Loans or the issuance of Letters of
Credit, as applicable, hereunder to such Credit Party nor the use of the
proceeds thereof by such Credit Party will violate the PATRIOT Act, the Trading
with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control regulations
of the United States Treasury Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as
amended) or any enabling legislation or executive order relating thereto. Such
Credit Party is in compliance in all material respects with the PATRIOT Act.

     SECTION 5.20 SECURITY DOCUMENTS. The Security Documents to which such
Credit Party is a party create a valid and enforceable security interest in and
Lien upon all right, title and interest of such Credit Party that in and to the
Collateral purported to be pledged by it thereunder and described therein,
superior to and prior to the rights of all third persons and subject to no other
Liens except as specifically permitted therein. No filings or recordings are
required in order to ensure the enforceability, perfection or priority of the
security interests created under the Security Documents to which such Credit
Party is a party, except for filings or recordings which shall have been
previously made; provided, that HCNL represents and warrants that the delivery
of the prescribed particulars of charge in the prescribed form to the Registrar
of Companies of England and Wales are required in order to ensure the
enforceability, perfection or priority of the security interests created under
the Security Documents to which HCNL is a party.

Borrower Materials that are to be made available to Public Lenders shall be
clearly and conspicuously marked "PUBLIC" which, at a minimum, shall mean that

marking Borrower Materials "PUBLIC," the Borrower shall be deemed to have
authorized the Administrative Agent, the Arranger, the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders to treat such Borrower Materials as either publicly available

proprietary) with respect to the Borrower or its securities for purposes of
United States Federal and state securities laws; (y) all Borrower Materials
marked "PUBLIC" are permitted to be made available through a portion of the
Platform designated "Public Investor;" and (z) the Administrative Agent and the

<PAGE>

under applicable Requirements of Law and, as to the Insurance Subsidiaries, by
each relevant Insurance Regulatory Authority; and

     (b) so long as no Default or Event of Default exists or would result

obtain in a comparable arm's length transaction with a Person other than an
Affiliate of the Borrower or such Subsidiary; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section shall prohibit:

     (a) transactions described on Schedule 7.8 or otherwise expressly permitted
hereunder; and

any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the

                                       81

<PAGE>

     (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

     (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise
any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent
is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of
its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law; and

     (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower, any of its Affiliates or any
of the Subsidiary Obligors that is communicated to or obtained by the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

     The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or

Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Section 10.1 and Section 8.2 or (ii) in the absence
of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent
shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a
Subsidiary Obligor, a Lender or the L/C Issuer.

     The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction

shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to the making of a Revolving Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of
Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the


                                       82

<PAGE>

satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume
that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender
or the L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Revolving Loan or the issuance of
such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel
(who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a
successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on
behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative
Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that if the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no
qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any
collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or
the L/C Issuer under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative
Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a
successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and the L/C
Issuer directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance
of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom
as provided above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.4 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub


                                       83

<PAGE>

agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was
acting as Administrative Agent.

     Any resignation by Wachovia as Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section shall also constitute its resignation as the L/C Issuer. Upon the
acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, (a)
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights,
powers, privileges and duties of a retiring L/C Issuer, (b) the retiring L/C
Issuer shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (c) the successor L/C Issuer
shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any,
outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangement
satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of
the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit.

     SECTION 9.7 NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each
Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender and the L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

     SECTION 9.8 NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Arranger shall not have any powers, duties or
responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except
in its capacity, as applicable, as Administrative Agent, a Lender or the L/C
Issuer hereunder.

     SECTION 9.9 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Credit Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective
of whether the principal of any Revolving Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be
due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on
the Borrower or any Subsidiary Obligor) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

     (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Revolving Loans, L/C Obligations and
all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents

under Section 2.3(i) and (j), Section 2.8and Section 10.4) allowed in such
judicial proceeding; and

each Lender and the L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent
and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of
such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the
Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and
counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Section 2.8
and Section 10.4.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or the L/C
Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such
subsection (b).

     (b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic
communication (including e mail and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to
procedures approved by the Administrative Agent, provided that the foregoing
shall not apply to notices to any Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to ARTICLE

procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

     Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other

sender's receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by
the "return receipt requested" function, as available, return e-mail or other

the Borrower, each Subsidiary Obligor, the Administrative Agent and the L/C
Issuer.

     (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer and Lenders. The
Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely
and act upon any notices (including telephonic Revolving Loan Notices)

if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete
or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein,
or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any
confirmation thereof. The Borrower and each Subsidiary Obligor shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of
each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the
reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Borrower or such Subsidiary Obligor. All telephonic notices to and other
telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such
recording.

     SECTION 10.3 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender, the
L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such
Person in exercising,


                                       87

<PAGE>

any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

     SECTION 10.4 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.

     (a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower (and each Subsidiary Obligor, to the
extent related to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Subsidiary
Obligor) shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and its Affiliates (including the reasonable fees, charges
and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent), in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and administration of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the
provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the L/C Issuer in connection with the issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment
thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer (including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C
Issuer), in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights (A) in
connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, including its
rights under this Section, or (B) in connection with the Revolving Loans made or
Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Revolving Loans or Letters of Credit.

     (b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower (and each Subsidiary
Obligor, to the extent related to any Letter of Credit issued for the account of
such Subsidiary Obligor) shall indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any
sub-agent thereof), each Lender and the L/C Issuer, and each Related Party of
any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or
asserted against any Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any
other Credit Party arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the
parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any
Revolving Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of the proceeds
therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a demand for payment
under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such
demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii)
any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the Borrower or any
other Credit Party, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto,
in all cases, whether or not caused


                                       88

<PAGE>

by or arising, in whole or in part, out of the comparative, contributory or sole
negligence of the Indemnitee; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim brought by the Borrower
or any other Credit Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such
Indemnitee's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the
Borrower or such Credit Party has obtained a judgment in its favor on such claim
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower or any
Subsidiary Obligor for any reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required
under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the
Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C Issuer or any Related
Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related
Party, as the case may be, such Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of
the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity as such, or against any Related
Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in connection with such capacity. The obligations
of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of
Section 2.11(d).

     (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Obligor shall not assert,
and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability,
for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct
or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Revolving Loan or
Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to
in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by
unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems
in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

     (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later
than ten Business Days after demand therefor.

     (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation
of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, the replacement of any Lender,
the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all the other Obligations.

     SECTION 10.5 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of any Credit Party is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer
or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender
exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff
or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared


                                       89

<PAGE>

to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to
any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such
Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other
party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication)
of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus
interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made
at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect.
The obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the
preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.6 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

     (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary Obligor may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible
Assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this Section,
(ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d)
of this Section, (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a security interest
subject to the restrictions of subsection (f) or (i) of this Section, or (iv) to
an SPC in accordance with the provisions of subsection (h) of this Section (and
any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto shall be null and
void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in
subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

     (b) Assignment by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment, the Revolving Loans,
and, for purposes of this subsection (b), participations in L/C Obligations, at
the time owing to it); provided that

          (i) except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount
     of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Revolving Loans at the time
     owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of
     a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount
     of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Revolving Loans
     outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the
     principal outstanding balance of the Revolving Loans of the assigning
     Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the
     Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to
     the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment
     and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000
     unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as


                                       90

<PAGE>

     no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise
     consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

          (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
     proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Agreement with respect to the Revolving Loans or the Commitment
     assigned; and

          (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
     processing and recordation fee of $3,500 for each assignment, and the
     Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
     Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a
party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1, Section 3.4, Section 3.5, and
Section 10.4 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the
effective date of such assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense)
shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

     (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as
an agent of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Obligor, shall maintain at the
Administrative Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered
to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Revolving Loans
and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time
to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and
the Borrower, each Subsidiary Obligor, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by each of the Borrower, each Subsidiary Obligor and the L/C Issuer
at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower, any Subsidiary Obligor or the Administrative Agent,
sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower
or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment, the Revolving Loans and/or such
Lender's participations in L/C Obligations owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely


                                       91

<PAGE>

responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Borrower, each Subsidiary Obligor, the Administrative Agent, the
Lenders and the L/C Issuer shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement.

     Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.1 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e)
of this Section, the Borrower and each Subsidiary Obligor agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1, Section 3.4, and
Section 3.5 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 10.9 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be
subject to Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender.

     (e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.1 or Section 3.4 than
the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Borrower's and each Subsidiary Obligor's prior
written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.1 unless the Borrower
and each Subsidiary Obligor is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower and
each Subsidiary Obligor, to comply with Section 3.1(e) as though it were a
Lender.

     (f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

     (g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution," "signed,"
"signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption shall be
deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic
form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in
any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act,
or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act.

     (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender
(a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified
as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower and each


                                       92

<PAGE>

Subsidiary Obligor (an "SPC") the option to provide all or any part of any
Revolving Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make
pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
commitment by any SPC to fund any Revolving Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not
to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such
Revolving Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Revolving
Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, or if it fails to do so, to make such payment
to the Administrative Agent as is required under Section 2.11(b)(ii). Each party
hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by
any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise
increase or change the obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Obligor
under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.4), (ii) no SPC
shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this
Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender
shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other
modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record
hereunder. The making of a Revolving Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the
Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Revolving
Loan were made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of
this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any
SPC, it will not institute against, or join any other Person in instituting
against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or
liquidation proceeding under the laws of the United States or any State thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with
notice to, but without prior consent of the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, assign all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to
any Revolving Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential
basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Revolving Loans to
any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or
Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

     (i) Resignation as L/C Issuer after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, if at any time Wachovia assigns all of its
Commitment and Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Wachovia may,
upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower, the Letter of Credit Obligors, and the
Lenders, resign as the L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as the
L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a
successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the
Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Wachovia
as the L/C Issuer. If Wachovia resigns as the L/C Issuer, it shall retain all
the rights and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all
Letters of Credit issued by it outstanding as of the effective date of its
resignation as the L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto
(including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Revolving Loans or
fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.3(c)).

     SECTION 10.7 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the
Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates' and to its and its Affiliates'
respective partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and
representatives (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is
made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and shall
have agreed to keep such


                                       93

<PAGE>

Information confidential substantially in accordance with this Section 10.7),
(b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have
jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the
NAIC), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any
subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject
to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee
of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or
(ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or
derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with
the prior written consent of the Borrower and each Subsidiary Obligor or (h) to
the extent such Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any of their respective
Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or a
Subsidiary Obligor.

     For purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received
from the Borrower, any Subsidiary Obligor or any Subsidiary relating to the
Borrower, any Subsidiary Obligor or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
businesses, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis
prior to disclosure by the Borrower, any Subsidiary Obligor or any Subsidiary,
provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any
Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the
time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

     SECTION 10.8 RIGHT OF SET-OFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever
currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any
time owing by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Obligor against any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Subsidiary Obligor now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such
Lender or the L/C Issuer, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the L/C
Issuer shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such Subsidiary
Obligor may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such
Lender or the L/C Issuer different from the branch or office holding such
deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of each Lender, the L/C
Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender,
the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender and the L/C
Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower or any Subsidiary Obligor, as the case may
be, and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such setoff and application.


                                       94

     SECTION 10.9 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Revolving
Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower or
Subsidiary Obligor, as the case may be. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender
exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 10.10 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 4.1, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall
have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective
as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

     SECTION 10.11 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Revolving Loan or any other Obligation hereunder
shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain
outstanding.

     SECTION 10.12 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 10.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 3.4, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount
to any Lender or any


                                       95

<PAGE>

Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.1, if
any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder
that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then
the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and
the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and
consents required by, Section 10.6), all of its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee
that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:

     (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment
fee specified in Section 10.6(b);

     (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Revolving Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.5) from the
assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

     (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 3.4 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.1, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments thereafter; and

     (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

     SECTION 10.14 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.

     (a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTIONS 5-1401 AND
5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW, BUT EXCLUDING ALL OTHER CHOICE
OF LAW AND CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES).

     (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER AND EACH OTHER CREDIT PARTY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW
YORK COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF
NEW YORK, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR FOR
RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT
OR, TO THE


                                       96

<PAGE>

FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE
JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
ANY LENDER OR THE L/C ISSUER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST THE
BORROWER OR ANY OTHER LOAN PARTY OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY
JURISDICTION.

     (c) WAIVER OF VENUE. THE BORROWER AND EACH OTHER LOAN PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
OBJECTION THAT IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION. EACH OF THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT.

     (d) SERVICE OF PROCESS. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO SERVICE
OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 10.2. NOTHING IN THIS
AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY
OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

     SECTION 10.15 WAIVER JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE THAT SUCH
OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

     SECTION 10.16 PATRIOT ACT NOTICE. Each Lender that is subject to the
PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any
Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the
PATRIOT Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and


                                       97

address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the

                                 EXISTING LIENS

1.   During the second quarter of 2004, OARC pledged and placed on deposit at
     Lloyd's of London the equivalent of L110 million of U.S. treasury notes on
     behalf of Advent Capital (Holdings) PLC ("Advent"). Advent is 46.8% owned
     by Fairfax and its affiliates, including 15.0% by the Borrower (7.51% by
     OARC and 7.51% by Clearwater). OARC retains the right to withdraw the funds
     at Lloyd's at any time upon 180 days advance written notice. The placement
     of funds at Lloyd's will automatically terminate effective December 31,
     2008 and any remaining funds at Lloyd's will revert to OARC at that time.

                              EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS

Guarantees

1. Clearwater agreed to allow Ranger Insurance Company ("Ranger"), a subsidiary
of Fairfax, to attach an assumption of liability endorsement to certain Ranger
policies issued from July 1, 1999 to April 30, 2004, the effective termination
date of the agreement. Should Ranger fail to meet its obligations, Clearwater is
ultimately liable for any losses occurring prior to the effective date of the
termination, pursuant to the terms of the endorsements. The total amount of
potential exposure in connection with the endorsements is estimated at $5.6
million as of June 30, 2005, based on the subject policies' case outstanding
loss reserves. Ranger has met and continues to meet all of its obligations,
including those subject to this agreement, in the normal course of business, and
Clearwater does not anticipate making any payments under this guarantee. In
addition, Fairfax has indemnified Clearwater for any obligations under this
agreement.

2. As of July 14, 2000, OARC agreed to guarantee the performance of all of the
insurance and reinsurance contract obligations, whether incurred before or after
the agreement, of Compagnie Transcontinentale de Reassurance ("CTR"), a
subsidiary of Fairfax, in the event CTR became insolvent and CTR was not
otherwise indemnified under its guarantee agreement with a Fairfax affiliate.
The OARC guarantee was entered into as part of the redeployment of CTR's
business to OARC, and was terminated effective December 31, 2001. Under
Fairfax's ownership, CTR was dissolved and its assets and liabilities were
assumed by other Fairfax affiliates which have the responsibility for the
run-off of its liabilities. In addition, Fairfax has agreed to indemnify OARC
for all its obligations under its guarantee. OARC does not expect to make any
payments under this guarantee.

3. OARC agreed, as of April 1, 2002, to guarantee the prompt payment of all of
the insurance contract obligations, whether incurred before or after the
agreement, of Falcon Insurance Company (Hong Kong) Limited, a subsidiary of
Fairfax, in the event that Falcon becomes insolvent. OARC's potential exposure
in connection with this agreement is estimated to be $35.8 million at June 30,
2005. Additionally, Fairfax has agreed to indemnify OARC for any obligation
under this agreement. OARC anticipates that Falcon will meet all of its
obligations in the normal course of business and does not anticipate making any
payments under this guarantee that will require OARC to utilize the
indemnification from Fairfax.

4. In January 2004, in conjunction with the purchase by its subsidiary (O.R.E
Holdings) of a 45% interest in Cheran Enterprises Private Limited ("CEPL"), an
Indian limited liability company, OARC agreed to provide a guarantee on behalf
of CEPL to facilitate CEPL's establishment of a credit facility in the amount of
up to $65 million. The guarantee is conditioned upon a pledge in favor of OARC
by the other shareholders of CEPL of assets with an aggregate value 1.5 times
the amount of the guarantee. As of the date hereof, the credit facility has not
been established and no guarantee has been provided.

Agreement dated as of the date hereof among [Odyssey Re Holdings Corp.,] the
Pledgor, the other Credit Parties thereto, the Lenders party thereto and the
Administrative Agent (as amended, restated, or otherwise modified from time to
time, the "Credit Agreement"; terms defined in the Credit Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein shall be used herein as defined in the Credit
Agreement).

     1. Grant of Security Interest. As security for any and all Indebtedness (as
defined below), the Pledgor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally pledges and
grants a security interest in and assigns and transfers to the Administrative
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Lenders (including the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such), all of the Pledgor's right, title and interest
in and to the property of the Pledgor referred to in Exhibit A attached hereto
and incorporated herein, as hereafter amended or supplemented from time to time
(the "L/C Collateral").

     2. Indebtedness. "Indebtedness" means all debts, obligations or
liabilities, now or hereafter existing, absolute or contingent, whether
voluntary or involuntary, due or not due, incurred directly or indirectly, or
acquired by the Lenders by assignment or otherwise (including, without
limitation, interest accruing after the maturity of such debts, obligations or
liabilities and interest accruing after the filing of any petition in
bankruptcy, or the commencement of any insolvency, reorganization or like
proceeding, relating to the Pledgor, whether or not a claim for post-filing or
post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), of the Pledgor to the
Lenders arising out of or in connection with any Secured Letter of Credit issued
by the L/C Issuer (including by or through an offshore branch or affiliate of
the L/C Issuer) for the account of the Pledgor, any reimbursement, indemnity or
similar agreements given by the Pledgor to the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in
connection therewith, and any amendment, substitution, extension or replacement
of any of the foregoing, and all obligations and liabilities of the Pledgor to
the L/C Issuer and the Lenders hereunder

     3. Maintenance of Collateral.

          (a) At all times prior to the date upon which the Obligations are paid
     in full, the Commitments are terminated and the Letters of Credit have
     expired (the "Release Date"), the Pledgor agrees to maintain as security
     for the Indebtedness, L/C Collateral of a type described on Schedule I
     hereto with a L/C Collateral Balance in an amount not less than the
     aggregate principal amount of L/C Obligations attributable to Secured
     Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Pledgor. For purposes
     hereof, the "L/C Collateral Balance" means, with respect to the Pledgor,
     the sum of the Collateral Value of each type of L/C Collateral held in a
     Custodial Account of the Pledgor multiplied by the Collateral Coverage
     Percentage set forth on Schedule I hereto for such type of L/C Collateral.
     The


Exhibit E-1

<PAGE>

     "Collateral Value" of government, municipal or corporate obligations or
     bonds or commercial paper shall be determined from the most recent closing
     bid price for such obligations, bonds or commercial paper obtained from the
     Wall Street Journal, or such other reputable reporting service as the
     Administrative Agent may select. If such closing bid price is not available
     in the Wall Street Journal, or such other reputable reporting service as
     the Administrative Agent may select, the Collateral Value shall be the
     value quoted to the Administrative Agent by a reputable brokerage firm
     selected by the Administrative Agent

          (b) If, at any time there is a Collateral Deficiency with respect to
     the Pledgor, the Pledgor shall no later than fourteen (14) days from the
     date of notice thereof by the Administrative Agent, pledge additional L/C
     Collateral to cure such Collateral Deficiency. If the Pledgor fails to
     pledge additional L/C Collateral to cure its Collateral Deficiency within
     the time provided above, the Administrative Agent may immediately exercise
     its rights and remedies set forth in Section 4 of this Agreement, including
     without limitation, liquidating all or part of the L/C Collateral. The
     Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that notice of a Collateral Deficiency may
     be given orally or in writing, including facsimile. Any such written notice
     to the Pledgor shall be given in accordance with the notice provisions of
     the Credit Agreement and shall be deemed received by the Pledgor as
     provided therein. Any such oral notice to the Pledgor and any written
     confirmation thereof shall be given in accordance with Section 15 of this
     Agreement and shall be deemed received by the Pledgor as provided herein.

     4. Pledgor's Covenants, Warranties and Representations. The Pledgor
covenants, represents and warrants that unless compliance is waived by the
Administrative Agent in writing:

          (a) The Pledgor owns all of the L/C Collateral free and clear of any
     and all liens, encumbrances, or interests of any third parties other than
     the security interest of the Administrative Agent, and will keep all of the
     L/C Collateral free of all liens, claims, security interests and
     encumbrances of any kind or nature, whether voluntary or involuntary,
     except the security interest of the Administrative Agent.

          (b) The Pledgor shall, at the Pledgor's expense, take all actions
     necessary or advisable from time to time to maintain the first priority and
     perfection of said security interest and shall not take any actions that
     would alter, impair or eliminate said priority or perfection.

          (c) The Pledgor agrees to pay prior to delinquency all taxes, charges,
     liens and assessments against the L/C Collateral, and upon the failure of
     the Pledgor to do so, the Administrative Agent at its option may pay any of
     them and shall be the sole judge of the legality or validity thereof and
     the amount necessary to discharge the same, such payments constituting
     Indebtedness hereunder.

          (d) The Pledgor's exact legal name is correctly set forth on Exhibit B
     hereto. The Pledgor will provide the Administrative Agent with at least 30
     days' prior written notice of any change in the Pledgor's name or identity.


Exhibit E-2

<PAGE>

          (e) The Pledgor's chief executive office is, and has been for the
     four-month period preceding the date hereof (or, if less, the entire period
     of the existence of the Pledgor), located in the state specified on Exhibit
     B hereto. In addition, the Pledgor is an organization of the type and (if
     not an unregistered entity) is incorporated in or organized under the laws
     of the state specified on Exhibit B hereto. The Pledgor shall give the
     Administrative Agent at least thirty (30) days notice before changing the
     location of its chief executive office, type of organization, business
     structure or state of incorporation or organization.

          (f) The Pledgor's organizational identification number, if any,
     assigned by the state of incorporation or organization is correctly set
     forth on Exhibit B hereto. The Pledgor shall promptly notify the
     Administrative Agent (i) of any change of its organizational identification
     number, or (ii) if the Pledgor does not have an organizational
     identification number and later obtains one, of such organizational
     identification number.

          (g) All investment property included in L/C Collateral is held by the
     Pledgor pursuant to the Federal Reserve System's treasury direct system.

     5. Powers of the Administrative Agent. At any time, without notice unless
expressly required elsewhere in this Agreement, and at the expense of the
Pledgor, the Administrative Agent in its name or in the name of the applicable
Pledgor may, but shall not be obligated to:

          (a) Collect by legal proceedings or otherwise, endorse, receive and
     receipt for all dividends, interest, principal payments and other sums now
     or hereafter payable upon or on account of the L/C Collateral.

          (b) Make any compromise or settlement it deems desirable or proper
     with reference to the L/C Collateral.

          (c) Insure, process and preserve the L/C Collateral.

          (d) Participate in any recapitalization, reclassification,
     reorganization, consolidation, redemption, stock split, merger or
     liquidation of any issuer of securities which constitute L/C Collateral,
     and in connection therewith may deposit or surrender control of the L/C
     Collateral, accept money or other property in exchange for the L/C
     Collateral, and take such action as it deems proper in connection
     therewith, and any money or property received on account of or in exchange
     for the L/C Collateral shall be applied to the Indebtedness or held by the
     Administrative Agent thereafter as L/C Collateral pursuant to the
     provisions hereof.

          (e) Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, cause L/C
     Collateral to be transferred to its name or to the name of its nominee or
     the name of a depository or its nominee.


Exhibit E-3

<PAGE>

          (f) Obtain from any custodian or securities intermediary holding the
     L/C Collateral any and all information with respect to the L/C Collateral,
     without any further consent of or notice to the Pledgor.

          (g) Exercise as to the L/C Collateral all the rights, powers and
     remedies of an owner necessary to exercise its rights under this Agreement,
     including without limitation, the right to sell or otherwise dispose of all
     or any part of the L/C Collateral following an Event of Default. The
     Administrative Agent shall not vote any securities constituting L/C
     Collateral except as instructed by the Pledgor, until an Event of Default
     has occurred and the Administrative Agent has delivered the Custodian a
     notice of exclusive control in respect of the L/C Collateral.

     The Pledgor hereby grants the Administrative Agent an irrevocable proxy and
irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent its attorney-in-fact to carry out
any of the powers granted by this paragraph. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Pledgor hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent
its attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver any necessary stock powers,
endorsements, assignments or other documents and agreements necessary to carry
out any of the foregoing powers. The foregoing appointments shall be deemed
coupled with an interest of the Administrative Agent and shall not be revoked
without the Administrative Agent's written consent. To the extent permitted by
law, the Pledgor hereby ratifies all said attorney-in-fact shall lawfully do by
virtue hereof. The Pledgor shall make and deliver to the Administrative Agent
such powers of attorney, consents or waivers (in addition to the power of
attorney and consent set forth in this Section 5) as the Administrative Agent
shall reasonably request in order to permit the Administrative Agent to exercise
its rights under this Section 5 and this Agreement.

     6. Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs, the Administrative Agent may do
any one or more of the following:

          (a) Exercise as to any or all of the L/C Collateral all the rights,
     powers and remedies of an owner; provided, however, that, the
     Administrative Agent shall not have the right to vote any securities
     constituting L/C Collateral until the Administrative Agent has provided the
     Custodian a notice of exclusive control in respect of the L/C Collateral.

          (b) Enforce the security interest given hereunder pursuant to the
     Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable state (the "UCC")
     and any other applicable law.

          (c) Sell all or any part of the L/C Collateral at public or private
     sale in accordance with the UCC, without advertisement, in such manner and
     order as the Administrative Agent may elect. The Administrative Agent may
     purchase the L/C Collateral for its own account at any such sale. The
     Administrative Agent shall give the applicable Pledgor such notice of any
     public or private sale as may be required by the UCC; provided that, if the
     Administrative Agent fails to comply with this sentence in any respect, its
     liability for such failure shall be limited to the liability (if any)
     imposed on it as a matter of law under the UCC. The Pledgor acknowledges
     that L/C Collateral may be sold at a loss to the Pledgor, and that, in such
     event, the Administrative Agent shall have


Exhibit E-4

<PAGE>

     no liability or responsibility to the Pledgor for such loss. The Pledgor
     further acknowledges that a private sale may result in less proceeds than a
     public sale.

          (d) Enforce the security interest of the Administrative Agent in any
     deposit account which is part of the L/C Collateral by applying such
     account to the Indebtedness.

          (e) Exercise any other remedy provided under this Agreement or by any
     applicable law. The Pledgor acknowledges that all such rights and remedies
     are cumulative, and the exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude
     the further exercise of any other right or remedy.

          (f) Comply with any applicable state or federal law requirements in
     connection with a disposition of the L/C Collateral and such compliance
     will not be considered to affect adversely the commercial reasonableness of
     any sale of the L/C Collateral.

          (g) Sell the L/C Collateral without giving any warranties as to the
     L/C Collateral. The Administrative Agent may specifically disclaim any
     warranties of title or the like. This procedure will not be considered to
     affect adversely the commercial reasonableness of any sale of the L/C
     Collateral.

     7. Waivers. The Administrative Agent shall be under no duty or obligation
whatsoever (a) to make or give any presentment, demands for performances,
notices of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest or notices of dishonor
in connection with any obligations or evidences of indebtedness held by the
Administrative Agent as L/C Collateral, or in connection with any obligation or
evidences of indebtedness which constitute in whole or in part the Indebtedness,
or (b) to give the Pledgor notice of, or to exercise, any subscription rights or
privileges, any rights or privileges to exchange, convert or redeem or any other
rights or privileges relating to or affecting any L/C Collateral.

     8. Custody of Collateral at Custodian.

          (a) On or prior to the date hereof and upon any Person becoming a
     Pledgor hereunder, the Pledgor shall have established with the Custodian,
     and at all times thereafter until the Indebtedness of the Pledgor shall
     have been indefeasibly paid in full and this Agreement is terminated in
     accordance with its terms, the Pledgor shall maintain with the Custodian
     the accounts listed on Exhibit A hereto (the "Collateral Accounts," and
     each a "Collateral Account").

          (b) With respect to each Collateral Account and the L/C Collateral,
     the Pledgor shall cause the Custodian to execute and deliver to the
     Administrative Agent on the date hereof a Collateral Account Control
     Agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto.

          (c) The Pledgor shall, no later than the date hereof, cause the
     Custodian to title each Collateral Account to reflect the security interest
     of Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders therein.


Exhibit E-5

<PAGE>

          (d) The Pledgor hereby agrees that funds contained in the Collateral
     Accounts shall be invested in L/C Collateral and only as permitted pursuant
     to the terms of this Agreement and the Credit Agreement.

     9. Indemnity Regarding the Custodian. If the Administrative Agent permits
any of the L/C Collateral to be maintained at a Custodian, the Pledgor hereby
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Administrative Agent, its
successors and assigns and its directors, officers, employees and agents, from
and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, obligations, deficiencies,
payments, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, costs and expenses
of any and all actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations, demands, assessments,
judgments, settlements, compromises relating thereto and reasonable attorneys'
fees and disbursements in connection therewith, and including allocated costs of
in-house counsel) sustained or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other
indemnitee in any way arising from or related to the Administrative Agent's
actions with respect to the Custodian as contemplated herein or contemplated by
any agreement with or notice to the Custodian, except such as are due to the
Administrative Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence.

     10. New or Substituted L/C Collateral. The Pledgor may add a new Custodial
Account as "L/C Collateral" under this Agreement, and/or terminate a Custodial
Account or remove a Custodial Account as L/C Collateral hereunder, in each case
by executing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a completed supplement
to this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D (each, a "Pledge Supplement");
provided that (i) prior to or concurrently with the addition of any new
Custodial Account, the Pledgor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent a true and correct copy of a statement of such Custodial
Account prepared by the Custodian thereof, indicating the contents of such
Custodial Account as of a recent date, a new Collateral Account Control
Agreement (or supplement to an existing Collateral Account Control Agreement)
executed by the Custodian and the Pledgor, evidencing the establishment of such
Custodial Account and the perfection of the security interest of the
Administrative Agent therein, and (if applicable) a copy of any new Collateral
Account Control Agreement with respect to such Custodial Account, and (ii) the
Pledgor may terminate a Custodial Account or remove a Custodial Account as L/C
Collateral hereunder unless, immediately after giving effect thereto, (A) the
Pledgor shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent an L/C Collateral
Balance Report evidencing that the L/C Collateral Balance (with respect to all
remaining Custodial Accounts of the Pledgor and all other L/C Collateral pledged
by the Pledgor pursuant to any Credit Document) would equal or exceed the sum of
the stated amount of the Pledgor's Secured Letters of Credit and (B) no other
Default or Event of Default would exist. The Pledgor hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to attach each such Pledge Supplement to this Agreement,
and agrees that all L/C Collateral listed or referred to on any Pledge
Supplement shall for all purposes be deemed L/C Collateral hereunder and shall
be subject to the provisions hereof.

     11. Costs. All advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred or paid by the Administrative Agent in exercising any
right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement or in the enforcement
thereof, and including the charges and expenses of the Administrative Agent's
custody unit or of any Custodian, shall become a part of the Indebtedness
secured hereunder and shall be paid to the Administrative Agent by the Pledgor
immediately and without demand, with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to
the highest rate


Exhibit E-6

<PAGE>

of interest of any Indebtedness secured by this Agreement (or, if there is no
such interest rate, at the maximum interest rate permitted by law for interest
on judgments). Such costs and attorneys' fees shall include, without limitation,
the allocated cost of in-house counsel.

     12. Notices. To the extent that oral notification is provided for or agreed
to herein, such oral notification may be made by telephone to the number(s) set
forth on the signature page for the Pledgor; provided that (i) any oral
notification in person or at any other telephone number shall constitute
notification hereunder (it being understood and agreed that a voicemail message
shall in no event constitute notification hereunder) and (ii) any oral
notification shall be promptly confirmed in writing, including by facsimile.

     13. Miscellaneous.

          (a) Any waiver, express or implied, of any provision hereunder and any
     delay or failure by the Administrative Agent to enforce any provision shall
     not preclude the Administrative Agent from enforcing any such provision
     thereafter.

          (b) The Pledgor hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to file one
     or more financing statements describing all or part of the Pledgor's L/C
     Collateral, and continuation statements, or amendments thereto, relative to
     all or part of the Pledgor's L/C Collateral as authorized by applicable
     law. Such financing statements, continuation statements and amendments will
     contain any other information required by the UCC for the sufficiency or
     filing office acceptance of any financing statement, continuation statement
     or amendment, including whether the Pledgor is an organization, the type of
     organization and any organizational identification number issued to the
     Pledgor. The Pledgor agrees to furnish any such information to the
     Administrative Agent promptly upon request.

          (c) The Pledgor shall, at the request of the Administrative Agent,
     execute such other agreements, documents or instruments in connection with
     this Agreement as the Administrative Agent may reasonably deem necessary to
     evidence or perfect the security interests granted herein, to maintain the
     first priority of the security interests, or to effectuate the rights
     granted to the Administrative Agent herein.

          (d) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed according to the
     internal laws of the State of New York, except as otherwise required by
     mandatory provisions of law and except to the extent that remedies are
     governed by the laws of any other jurisdiction. The Pledgor hereby
     irrevocably (i) submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United
     States Federal or State court sitting in New York, New York in any action
     or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and (ii) waives
     to the fullest extent permitted by law any defense asserting an
     inconvenient forum in connection therewith. Service of process by the
     Administrative Agent in connection with such action or proceeding shall be
     binding on the Pledgor if sent to the Pledgor by registered or certified
     mail at its address specified below. The Pledgor agrees that the
     Administrative Agent may disclose to any prospective purchaser and any
     purchaser of all


Exhibit E-7

<PAGE>

     or part of the Indebtedness any and all information in the Administrative
     Agent's possession concerning the Pledgor, this Agreement and the L/C
     Collateral.

          (e) Any term used or defined in the UCC and not defined in this
     Agreement has the meaning given to the term in the UCC, when used in this
     Agreement.

          (f) This Agreement shall benefit the Administrative Agent's successors
     and assigns and shall bind the Pledgor's successors and assigns, except
     that the Pledgor may not assign its rights and obligations under this
     Agreement. This Agreement shall bind all parties who become bound as a
     debtor with respect to the Indebtedness.

          (g) All rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
     exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise provided by law. Any single
     or partial exercise of any right or remedy shall not preclude the further
     exercise of any other right or remedy.

          (h) In all cases where more than one party executes this Agreement,
     all words used herein in the singular shall be deemed to have been used in
     the plural where the context and construction so require, and the
     obligations and undertakings hereunder are joint and several.

     14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
PLEDGOR AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT EACH WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO
ANY ACTION, CLAIM, SUIT OR PROCEEDING ON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

     15. NOTICE OF FINAL AGREEMENT. THIS WRITTEN SECURITY AGREEMENT AND ANY
OTHER DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT REPRESENT
THE FINAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE
OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE
ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

                  APPOINTMENT AND STATUS OF CUSTODIAN; ACCOUNT

     2.1 Appointment; Identification of Collateral. Administrative Agent and
Pledgor each hereby appoints Custodian to perform its duties as hereinafter set
forth and authorizes Custodian to hold the Collateral in the Account in
registered form in its name or the name of its nominees. Custodian hereby
accepts such appointment and agrees to establish and maintain the Account and
appropriate records identifying the Collateral in the Account as pledged by
Pledgor to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties.
Pledgor hereby authorizes Custodian, and Custodian agrees, to comply with all
Written Instructions, including entitlement orders, originated by Administrative
Agent with respect to the Collateral without further consent or direction from
Pledgor or any other party.

     2.2 Status as Securities Intermediary. The parties agree that Custodian is
a "securities intermediary", and intend that all securities and securities
entitlements held in the Account shall be treated as financial assets.

                                   ARTICLE III

                               COLLATERAL SERVICES

     3.1 Use of Depositories. Administrative Agent and Pledgor hereby authorize
Custodian to utilize Depositories to the extent possible in connection with its
performance hereunder. Collateral held by Custodian in a Depository will be held
subject to the rules, terms and conditions of such Depository. Where Collateral
is held in a Depository, Custodian shall identify on its records as belonging to
Pledgor and pledged to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties a quantity of securities as part of a fungible bulk of
securities held in Custodian's account at such Depository. Securities deposited
in a Depository will be represented in accounts which include only assets held
by Custodian for its customers.

     3.2 Notice of Exclusive Control. Until Custodian receives a Notice of
Exclusive Control from Administrative Agent, Custodian is authorized to act upon
any Written Instructions, including entitlement orders, from either
Administrative Agent or Pledgor. Administrative Agent may, subject to terms of

the Collateral held therein at any time by delivering to Custodian a Notice of
Exclusive Control. Upon receipt of a Notice of Exclusive Control, Custodian
shall, without inquiry and in reliance upon such Notice, and shall cause its
agents and subcustodians to, thereafter comply with Written Instructions
(including entitlement orders) solely from Administrative Agent with respect to
the Account and the Collateral held therein.

     3.3 Collateral Removal; Substitutions. Until Custodian receives a Notice of
Exclusive Control from Administrative Agent, Custodian is authorized to act upon
any Written Instructions from Pledgor to transfer, redeem or invest Collateral
from the Account or substitute other Collateral for any Collateral then held in
the Account ("Substitute Collateral"). It shall be Pledgor's sole responsibility
to ensure that at all times the market value of Collateral in the Account
(including Substitute Collateral) shall not be less than the amount Pledgor is
required to maintain pursuant to the Credit Agreement.


Exhibit E-14

<PAGE>

     3.4 Payment of Proceeds. Until Custodian receives a Notice of Exclusive
Control, Custodian shall transfer to Pledgor (whether by credit to Pledgor's
custody account at Custodian or otherwise) all proceeds received by Custodian
with respect to the Collateral. After Custodian's receipt of a Notice of
Exclusive Control, Custodian shall credit to the Account all proceeds received
by Custodian with respect to the Collateral.

     3.5 Advances by Custodian. Until Custodian receives a Notice of Exclusive
Control, Custodian is authorized to act upon Pledgor's Written Instructions to
Custodian to settle transactions involving the Account. Pledgor shall ensure
that the market value of the Collateral in the Account after settlement of any
such transactions shall not be less than the amount Pledgor is required to
maintain pursuant to the Credit Agreement. If any advance of funds is made by
Custodian under the customary securities settlement practices to purchase, or to
make payment on or against delivery of any investment property to be held in the
Account, Custodian shall have a continuing security interest in and right of
setoff against such investment property and the proceeds thereof, until such
time the investment property is delivered, settled, or reversed or Custodian is
repaid the amount of such advance.

     3.6 Statements. Within ten Business Days after the end of each calendar
month and within one Business Day of such other times as Pledgor or
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, Custodian shall supply to each of
Pledgor and Administrative Agent a separate written report listing the
securities and any other financial assets held in the Account. Such report shall
include the principal amount and/or number of shares of each security or
financial asset, as appropriate, and the market value thereof. Custodian shall
furnish Pledgor and Administrative Agent with advices of transactions affecting
the Account and monthly Account statements. Each of Pledgor and Administrative
Agent may elect to receive advices and statements electronically through the
Internet to an email address specified by it for such purpose. Each of Pledgor
and Administrative Agent acknowledges that there are risks inherent in
communicating through the Internet, such as the possibility of virus
contamination and disruptions in service, and agrees that Custodian shall not be
responsible for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by Pledgor,
Administrative Agent, or any person claiming by or through Pledgor or
Administrative Agent as a result of the use of such methods.

     3.7 Notice of Adverse Claims. Upon receipt of written notice of any lien,
encumbrance or adverse claim against the Account or any portion of the
Collateral carried therein, Custodian shall use reasonable efforts to notify
Administrative Agent and Pledgor as promptly as practicable under the
circumstances.

     3.8 The Account. Custodian hereby confirms and agrees that (i) the Account
has been established in the name of Pledgor as recited above which has been
titled to reflect the security interest of Administrative Agent for the ratable
benefit of the Secured Parties therein and (ii) Pledgor is the sole owner of the
Account. Except for the claims and interest of Administrative Agent and Pledgor
in the Account, Custodian does not know of any other claim to or interest in the
Account. Each party hereto agrees that (i) the Account constitutes a "securities
account" within the meaning of Article 8 of the UCC, (ii) any demand deposit
account established and maintained in connection with the Account constitutes a
"deposit account" within the meaning of Article 9 of the UCC and (iii) all
property, including cash, now or hereafter held, credited or carried by, in or
to the credit of the Account shall be treated as


Exhibit E-15

<PAGE>

financial assets. For purposes of perfecting the security interest of
Administrative Agent in any property (other than Security Entitlements of
Pledgor) at any time now or hereafter held in or credited to the Account,
Custodian hereby acknowledges that it holds and will hold such property as
collateral for the benefit of Administrative Agent, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that no "security
entitlement" under the UCC shall exist with respect to any financial asset held
in the Account which is registered in the name of Pledgor, payable to the order
of Pledgor or specially indorsed to Pledgor, except to the extent the foregoing
have been indorsed to Custodian or in blank. All property delivered to Custodian
and directed by Pledgor in writing to be included in the Account pursuant to the
terms of the Custodial Agreement shall be promptly credited to the Account.

     3.9 The Securities. Custodian shall accept and retain the securities in the
form in which received, except for those securities received in physical form
which may be held in the name of Custodian's nominee or agent or which may be
converted to the Depository Trust Company or other book-entry system, subject in
each case to withdrawal or other disposition pursuant to this Agreement. All
securities delivered to Custodian shall be in good deliverable form as
determined by Custodian with reference to applicable law and industry practices.
Pledgor certifies in case any financial asset credited to the Account shall be
registered in the name of Pledgor, payable to the order of Pledgor or specially
indorsed to Pledgor, Pledgor will indorse the same to Custodian or in blank.
Custodian agrees that it shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and Pledgor
in writing after becoming aware (using reasonable care) that any financial asset
credited to the Account is registered or indorsed in contravention of this
Section 3.9; provided, however, that Custodian shall have no liability hereunder
for the failure to deliver such notice except to the extent such failure results
from its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     3.10 Priority of Lien. Custodian hereby acknowledges the security interest
granted in the Collateral to Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the
Secured Parties by Pledgor. Custodian hereby confirms that it will not advance
any margin or other credit to Pledgor or hypothecate any securities carried in
the Account. Custodian hereby subordinates all liens, encumbrances, claims and
rights of setoff it may have, now or in the future, against the Account or any
property carried in the Account or any free credit balance in the Account other
than as set forth in Section 3.4. Custodian will not agree with any third party
that Custodian will comply with entitlement orders concerning the Account
originated by such third party without the prior written consent of
Administrative Agent and Pledgor. Custodian represents that no such agreement
with any third party is now in effect.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                          GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

     4.1 Standard of Care; Indemnification.

          (a) Custodian shall be responsible for the performance of only such
     duties as are set forth herein or contained in instructions given to
     Custodian which are not contrary to the provisions of this Agreement.
     Custodian will use reasonable care with respect to the safekeeping of
     property in the Account and, except as otherwise expressly provided


Exhibit E-16

<PAGE>

     herein, in carrying out its obligations under this Agreement. Custodian's
     responsibility hereunder is limited to any loss occasioned by the bad
     faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any director, officer,
     agent or employee of Custodian or by robbery, burglary or theft (while the
     securities and financial assets are in Custodian's physical possession), to
     the extent of the market value of such Securities and Financial Assets at
     the date of the discovery of such loss if such securities or financial
     assets cannot be replaced by Custodian.

          (b) Except for permitting a withdrawal or payment to, or advancing
     margin or other credit to, Pledgor in violation of the terms hereof,
     Custodian shall not be liable for any costs, expenses, damages, liabilities
     or claims, including attorneys' fees ("Losses") incurred by or asserted
     against Pledgor or any Secured Party, except those Losses arising out of
     the bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct of Custodian. Custodian
     shall have no liability whatsoever for the action or inaction of any
     Depository. In no event shall Custodian be liable for special, indirect or
     consequential damages, or lost profits or loss of business, arising in
     connection with this Agreement.

          (c) Administrative Agent and Pledgor agree, jointly and severally, to
     indemnify Custodian and hold Custodian harmless from and against any and
     all Losses sustained or incurred by or asserted against Custodian by reason
     of or as a result of any action or inaction, or arising out of Custodian's
     performance hereunder, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
     incurred by Custodian in a successful defense of claims by Pledgor or
     Administrative Agent; provided, that Pledgor and Administrative Agent shall
     not indemnify and hold Custodian harmless for those Losses arising out of
     Custodian's bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct. This indemnity
     shall be a continuing obligation of Pledgor and Administrative Agent, their
     respective successors and assigns, notwithstanding the termination of this
     Agreement.

     4.2 No Obligation Regarding Quality of Collateral. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Custodian shall be under no obligation, other than
the duty to exercise due care in accordance with reasonable commercial
standards, to inquire into, and shall not be liable for, any Losses incurred by
Pledgor, Administrative Agent or any other person as a result of the receipt or
acceptance of fraudulent, forged or invalid Collateral, or Collateral which
otherwise is not freely transferable or deliverable without encumbrance in any
relevant market.

     4.3 No Responsibility Concerning Collateral Agreement. Pledgor and
Administrative Agent hereby agree that, notwithstanding references to the
Collateral Agreement in this Agreement, Custodian has no interest in, and no
duty, responsibility or obligation with respect to, the Collateral Agreement
(including without limitation, no duty, responsibility or obligation to monitor
Pledgor's or Administrative Agent's compliance with the Collateral Agreement or
to know the terms of the Collateral Agreement).

     4.4 No Duty of Oversight. Custodian is not at any time under any duty to
monitor the value of any Collateral in the Account or whether the Collateral is
of a type required to be held in the Account, or to supervise the investment of,
or to advise or make any recommendation for the purchase, sale, retention or
disposition of any Collateral.


Exhibit E-17

<PAGE>

     4.5 No Collection Obligations. Custodian shall be under no obligation to
take action to collect any amount payable on Collateral in default, except with
respect to payments actually made or if payment is refused after due demand and
presentment.

     4.6 Fees and Expenses. Pledgor agrees to pay to Custodian the fees as may
be agreed upon from time to time. Pledgor shall reimburse Custodian for all
reasonable out of pocket costs associated with transfers of Collateral to
Custodian and records kept in connection with this Agreement. Pledgor shall also
reimburse Custodian for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses which are a normal
incident of the services provided hereunder.

     4.7 Effectiveness of Instructions; Reliance; Risk Acknowledgements;
Additional Terms.

          (a) Subject to the terms below, Custodian shall be entitled to rely
     upon any Written Instructions actually received by Custodian from an
     Authorized Person and reasonably believed by Custodian to be duly
     authorized and delivered; provided however, in no event shall Custodian be
     entitled to rely upon any Written Instructions received from Pledgor after
     the receipt by Custodian of a Notice of Exclusive Control from
     Administrative Agent.

          (b) If Custodian receives Written Instructions which appear on their
     face to be genuine and to have been transmitted via (i) computer facsimile,
     email, the Internet or other insecure electronic method, or (ii) secure
     electronic transmission containing applicable authorization codes,
     passwords and/or authentication keys, Administrative Agent and Pledgor each
     understands and agrees that Custodian cannot determine the identity of the
     actual sender of such Written Instructions and that Custodian shall
     conclusively presume that such Written Instructions have been sent by an
     Authorized Person. Administrative Agent and Pledgor shall be responsible
     for ensuring that only its Authorized Persons transmit such Written
     Instructions to Custodian and that all of its Authorized Persons treat
     applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication
     keys with extreme care.

          (c) Administrative Agent and Pledgor each acknowledges and agrees that
     it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the
     various methods of transmitting Written Instructions to Custodian and that
     there may be more secure methods of transmitting Written Instructions than
     the method(s) selected by it. Administrative Agent and Pledgor each agrees
     that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its
     transmission of Written Instructions provide to it a commercially
     reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and
     circumstances.

          (d) If Administrative Agent or Pledgor elects (with Custodian's prior
     consent) to transmit Written Instructions through an on-line communications
     service owned or operated by a third party, it agrees that Custodian shall
     not be responsible or liable for the reliability or availability of any
     such service.


Exhibit E-18

<PAGE>

     4.8 Inspection. Upon reasonable request and provided Custodian shall suffer
no significant disruption of its normal activities, Administrative Agent or
Pledgor shall have access to Custodian's books and records relating to the
Account during Custodian's normal business hours. Upon reasonable request,
copies of any such books and records shall be provided to Administrative Agent
or Pledgor at the requesting party's expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
when Custodian receives a Notice of Exclusive Control from Administrative Agent,
Pledgor shall have no right to Custodian's books and records in connection with
the Account.

     4.9 Account Disclosure. Custodian is authorized to supply any information
regarding the Account which is required by any law or governmental regulation
now or hereafter in effect. Custodian shall give Administrative Agent and
Pledgor (prior to the delivery of a Notice of Exclusive Control) prompt notice
of any such disclosure including in its notice the legal basis for the required
disclosure. Custodian shall reasonably cooperate in obtaining a protective order
or other appropriate protection relating to the disclosure. Custodian shall
disclose only that portion of Account information that it is legally required to
disclose.

     4.10 Force Majeure. Custodian shall not be responsible or liable for any
failure or delay in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement
arising out of or caused, directly or indirectly, by circumstances beyond its
reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God; earthquakes;
fires; floods; wars; civil or military disturbances; sabotage; epidemics; riots;
interruptions, loss or malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or
software) or communications service; accidents; labor disputes; acts of civil or
military authority; or governmental actions.

     4.11 Pricing Services. Custodian may, as an accommodation, provide pricing
or other information services to Pledgor and/or Administrative Agent in
connection with this Agreement. Custodian may utilize any vendor (including
securities brokers and dealers) believed by it to be reliable to provide such
information. Under no circumstances shall Custodian be liable for any loss,
damage or expense suffered or incurred by Pledgor or Administrative Agent as a
result of errors or omissions with respect to any pricing or other information
utilized by Custodian hereunder.

     4.12 No Implied Duties. Custodian shall have no duties or responsibilities
whatsoever except such duties and responsibilities as are specifically set forth
in this Agreement, and no covenant or obligation shall be implied against
Custodian in connection with this Agreement.

     4.13 Pledgor Agreement. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement
and any other agreement between Custodian and Pledgor, the terms of this
Agreement will control.

of Collateral. Except as otherwise provided herein, all obligations of the
parties to each other hereunder shall cease upon termination of this Agreement.
