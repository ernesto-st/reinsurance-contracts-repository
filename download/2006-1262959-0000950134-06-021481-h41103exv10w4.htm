foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed such

any other guarantor. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrowers waive in the event
of foreclosure of any or all of the Mortgages, all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrowers and of the Borrowing Base Properties, or to a sale in inverse order of alienation
in the event of foreclosure of all or any of the Mortgages, and agree in the event of
foreclosure of any or all of the Mortgages, not to assert any right under any laws
pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to
defeat, reduce or affect the right of Agent or any Lender under the Financing Documents to a
sale of the Borrowing Base Properties for the collection of the Obligations without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Agent to the payment of the
Obligations out of the net proceeds of the Borrowing Base Properties in preference to every
other claimant whatsoever. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrowers
waive in the event of foreclosure of any or all of the Mortgages, any equitable right
otherwise available to Borrowers which would require the separate sale of the Borrowing Base
Properties or require Agent to exhaust its remedies against any one of the Borrowing Base
Properties or combination of the Borrowing Base

reasonably acceptable to Agent. No Insurance Policy shall contain any exclusion for terrorism or

approval of Agent, unless a separate policy of terrorism insurance reasonably acceptable to Agent
shall have been provided to Agent. Without Agent&#146;s prior consent, no Borrower shall name any
Person other than Agent as loss payee or mortgagee under any property Insurance Policies nor shall

other than the Borrowing Base Properties and such improvements and betterments. Each Borrower will
pay the premiums for the Insurance Policies as the same become due and payable. Each Borrower will
deliver to Agent certified copies of the Insurance Policies required to be maintained pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;5.19(a)</U> hereof, <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, Agent shall not be deemed by
reason of the custody of such Insurance Policies to have knowledge of the contents thereof. Each
Borrower will also deliver to Agent, within ten (10)&nbsp;days of Agent&#146;s request, a certificate of such
Borrower, or an insurance agent thereof evidencing the coverages set forth herein together with
evidence that all premiums due thereon have been paid and that the same are in full force and

Policies, each Borrower will deliver or cause to be delivered to Agent a certificate of insurance
evidencing renewal of coverage as required herein or, at Agent&#146;s request, a certified copy of a
renewal policy or policies, in each case together with evidence satisfactory to Agent that all
premiums therefor have been paid and that the policies are in full force and effect.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the approval of any insurance or insurance company by Agent shall

this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance
upon Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to
time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or

Each Lender acknowledges the potential conflict of interest of each other Lender as a result of
Lenders holding disproportionate interests in the Loans, and expressly consents to and waives any

participate as a Lender in decisions under this Agreement, including any rights to approve or
direct any determination, action or inaction of Agent where the approval or direction of Lenders is
required or permitted hereby, and such Defaulting Lender&#146;s right to assign, transfer, sell all or
any portion of its rights in and to the Loan or a participation therein pursuant to <U>Section

any amount required to be paid by such Defaulting Lender to or for the benefit of Agent or any
other Lender hereunder, then, in addition to other rights and remedies which Agent or such other
Lender may have hereunder or otherwise, Agent or any Lender shall be entitled, but not obligated
(i)&nbsp;to advance funds on behalf of any Defaulting Lender, (ii)&nbsp;to collect interest from the
Defaulting Lender at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation until the date on which the
payment is made, (iii)&nbsp;to withhold or set off or in the case of a Lender, to cause Agent to
withhold or setoff, and to apply to the payment of the defaulted amount and any related interest,
any amounts to be paid to the Defaulting Lender under this Agreement, (iv)&nbsp;to bring an action or
suit against the Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted
amount and any related interest and (v)&nbsp;to purchase the Defaulting Lender&#146;s interest in the Loans
in the manner set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;8.11</U>. Upon the Defaulting Lender&#146;s failure to make
payments as set forth herein and so long as such failure remains uncured (and it is agreed an
advance of funds by any other Lender pursuant to clause (i)&nbsp;above shall not be considered a cure of
the Defaulting Lender&#146;s default), the Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive its share
of any payments made by any Borrower (or amounts owed by any Borrower)

Lender shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its discretion, to acquire such Defaulting

with such acquiring Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share or by any proportion collectively agreed upon by

applicable Lender(s) electing to exercise such right to the Defaulting Lender (an &#147;<U>Exercise

Notice shall specify (i)&nbsp;the purchase price for the interest of the Defaulting Lender, determined
in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;8.11(d)</U> hereof and (ii)&nbsp;the date on which such purchase is to
occur, which shall be any Business Day which is not less than fifteen (15)&nbsp;days after the date on
which the Exercise Notice is given, provided that if such Defaulting Lender shall have cured its
default in full (including with the payment of any interest and other
amounts due in connection therewith) to the satisfaction of Agent within said fifteen (15)&nbsp;day
period, then the Exercise Notice shall be of no further effect and the non-defaulting Lender(s)
shall no longer have a right to purchase such Defaulting Lender&#146;s interest. Upon any such purchase
of a Defaulting Lender&#146;s interest and as of the date of such purchase (the &#147;<U>Purchase

hereunder as a Lender arising from and after the Purchase Date (but not its rights and liabilities
with respect thereto or under this Agreement or the other Financing Documents for obligations,
indemnities and other matters arising or matters occurring before the Purchase Date) shall
terminate on the Purchase Date, and the Defaulting Lender shall promptly execute all documents
reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest. Without in any manner limiting the
remedies of Agent or any other Lender, the obligation of a Defaulting Lender to sell and assign its
interest in the Loan and the Commitments under this <U>Section&nbsp;8.11</U> shall be specifically
enforceable by Agent and/or any other Lender by an action brought in any court of competent
jurisdiction for such purpose, it being acknowledged and agreed that, in light of the disruption in
