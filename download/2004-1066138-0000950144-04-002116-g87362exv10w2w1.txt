SECTION 2.1       LOAN.

         (A)      LOAN. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Loan
Agreement and in reliance upon the representations and warranties of the
Borrowers contained herein, Lender agrees to lend to the Borrowers, and the
Borrowers agree to borrow from Lender, a loan in the original principal amount
of $224,036,325 (such loan and the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the same
together with all interest and other amounts from time to time owing hereunder
may be referred to as the "LOAN").

                                       25

<PAGE>

         (B)      NOTE. On the Closing Date, the Borrowers shall execute and
deliver to Lender a Promissory Note, dated of even date herewith (as amended,
modified or restated, and any replacement or substitute notes therefor, by means
of multiple notes or otherwise, collectively, the "NOTE"), made by the Borrowers
to the order of Lender, in the original principal amount of $224,036,325.

         (C)      USE OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds of the Loan funded at Closing
shall be used to (i) refinance existing indebtedness; (ii) pay all recording
fees and taxes, title insurance premiums, the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Lender, including reasonable legal fees and expenses of
counsel to Lender, and other costs and expenses approved by Lender (which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld) related to the Loan; (iii) establish
the Reserves required hereunder; (iv) fund cash collateral requirements under
certain letters of credit; and (v) provide for general corporate purposes,
including, without limitation, payment of transaction costs and expenses
incurred by the Borrowers. The remaining proceeds of the Loan, if any, shall be
disbursed to or as otherwise directed by the Borrowers.

SECTION  2.2      INTEREST.

         (A)      RATE OF INTEREST. The outstanding principal balance of the
Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate in
effect for each Interest Accrual Period during the term hereof. The "INTEREST
RATE" for any Interest Accrual Period shall be the rate of interest per annum
equal to the sum of (i) the Applicable Spread plus (ii) the LIBO Rate in effect
for such Interest Accrual Period.

         (B)      DEFAULT RATE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default and in any event
from and after the Maturity Date of the Loan and until the Loan and all other
Obligations are satisfied in full, the outstanding principal balance of the Loan
and all other Obligations shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per
annum that is five percent (5.0%) in excess of the Interest Rate otherwise
applicable under this Loan Agreement and the Note (the "DEFAULT RATE").

         (C)      COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the Loan and all other
Obligations owing to Lender shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year,
and shall be charged for the actual number of days elapsed during any month or
other accrual period. Interest shall be payable in arrears (except with respect
to the number of days from the Payment Date in any Interest Accrual Period to
the last day of such Interest Accrual Period as to which interest shall be
payable in advance, if any).

         (D)      INTEREST LAWS. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the Borrowers
shall not be required to pay, and Lender shall not be permitted to collect, any
amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted by law
("EXCESS INTEREST"). If any Excess Interest is provided for or determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have been provided for in this Loan Agreement
or in any of the other Loan Documents, then in such event: (1) the provisions of
this subsection shall govern and control, (2) the Borrowers shall not be
obligated to pay any Excess Interest; (3) any Excess Interest that Lender may
have received hereunder shall be, at Lender's option, (a) applied as a credit
against either or both of the outstanding principal balance of the

                                       26

<PAGE>

Loan or accrued and unpaid interest thereunder (not to exceed the maximum amount
permitted by law), (b) refunded to the payor thereof, or (c) any combination of
the foregoing; (4) the interest rate(s) provided for herein shall be
automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate allowed from time to time under
applicable law (the "MAXIMUM RATE"), and this Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to have been and shall be, reformed and modified to
reflect such reduction; and (5) the Borrowers shall not have any action against
Lender for any damages arising out of the payment or collection of any Excess
Interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if for any period of time interest on
any Obligation is calculated at the Maximum Rate rather than the applicable rate
under this Loan Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes less than
the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable on such Obligations shall, to the
extent permitted by law, remain at the Maximum Rate until Lender shall have
received or accrued the amount of interest which Lender would have received or
accrued during such period on Obligations had the rate of interest not been
limited to the Maximum Rate during such period. If the Default Rate shall be
finally determined to be unlawful, then the Interest Rate shall be applicable
during any time when the Default Rate would have been applicable hereunder,
provided however that if the Maximum Rate is greater or lesser than the Interest
Rate, then the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall apply.

         (E)      LATE CHARGES. If an Event of Default regarding non-payment of
principal, interest or other sums due hereunder or under any of the other Loan
Documents shall occur, then the Borrowers shall pay to Lender, in addition to
all sums otherwise due and payable, a late fee in an amount equal to five
percent (5.0%) of such principal, interest or other sums due hereunder or under
any other Loan Document, such late charge to be immediately due and payable
without demand by Lender.

SECTION 2.3       INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT.

         (A)      As a condition to Closing, the Borrowers shall purchase and
pledge and deliver to Lender an interest rate cap agreement satisfying the
criteria set forth below (the "CAP"), and the Borrowers shall maintain such Cap
in the possession of Lender, in full force and effect, until all Obligations are
fully and finally repaid. The Cap (i) shall have a notional amount equal to the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan calculated based upon the declining
principal balance of the Loan scheduled to be outstanding over the term of such
Cap taking into account scheduled principal amortization hereunder, (ii) shall
provided that to the extent that the LIBO Rate exceeds six and one half percent
(6.5%) per annum (the "CAP THRESHOLD RATE"), then the Cap Provider shall pay to
Lender, on behalf of the Borrowers, not less than the amount of interest that
would accrue on the Loan at a per annum rate equal to the difference between the
LIBO Rate and the Cap Threshold Rate, (iii) shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Lender, (iv) shall have a term equal to the Initial
Term of the Loan (or the applicable Extension Term), and (v) shall be issued by
a financial institution (the "CAP PROVIDER") having a financial rating by S&P of
at least "AA" (and at least an equivalent rating from each of the other Rating
Agencies).

         (B)      If at any time the financial rating assigned to any Cap
Provider by S&P shall fall below AA- (or the equivalent rating for any other
Rating Agency), the Borrowers shall be required to deliver a replacement Cap in
substantially the form of the Cap delivered at Closing issued by a Cap Provider
meeting the rating requirements for a Cap Provider under Section

                                       27

<PAGE>

2.3(A)(v), providing for a cap "strike price" not greater than the Cap Threshold
Rate (a replacement Cap meeting all of the foregoing conditions, an "ACCEPTABLE
REPLACEMENT CAP") within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of notice from
Lender or Servicer of such downgrade of the Cap Provider, together with an
assignment of such Cap substantially in the form of the Assignment of Rate Cap
and such Financing Statements and opinions of in-house or outside counsel to the
Cap Provider as Lender may reasonably require each in form and substance
acceptable to Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, under no
circumstances shall the Cap be terminated by the Borrowers prior to delivery of
an Acceptable Replacement Cap, together with the required documentation with
respect thereto, to Lender. If, for any reason, the Borrowers are unable to
deliver a replacement Cap when required hereunder, then at or prior to the time
when the replacement Cap is due hereunder, the Borrowers shall deliver to Lender
cash security (such cash security together with any interest thereon, the "CAP
RESERVE") in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of additional interest
which Lender reasonably estimates may be incurred during the remaining term of
the Loan (or remaining Extension Term then in effect) as a result of the LIBO
Rate exceeding the Cap Threshold Rate, which Cap Reserve shall be held by Lender
and applied to the Obligations in accordance with Section 6.1. Upon delivery of
an Acceptable Replacement Cap reasonably acceptable to Lender, the remaining
balance of the Cap Reserve shall be promptly returned to the Borrowers.

         (C)      All payments made by the Cap Provider under the Cap shall be
deposited directly by the Cap Provider into the Lock Box Account and applied in
accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.

         (A)      PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL. The Borrowers shall make

or (y) Mortgage Lender's Percentage of all Excess Cash Flow; provided that the
amount of Mortgage Lender's Percentage of the amount of any Release Price Excess
for any Property released during such period shall be deemed applied (without
duplication) in reduction of each of the Scheduled Mortgage Principal Payments
next becoming due and payable under this clause (ii) and under clause (iii) of
this Section 2.4(A) through the Scheduled Maturity Date (but not beyond) in an
amount equal to (x) Mortgage Lender's Percentage of such Release Price Excess

remaining through the Scheduled Maturity Date; and

in December 2003, and on each Payment Date thereafter through the Maturity Date,
the Borrowers shall make

Mortgage Principal Payments next becoming due and payable under this Section
2.4(A)(iii) through the Scheduled Maturity Date (but not beyond), or, if the
subject Release occurs during an Extension Term, through the last Scheduled
Mortgage Principal Payment to be made during that Extension Term (but not
beyond) in an amount equal to (x) the Mortgage Lender's Percentage of such
Release Price Excess divided by (y) the number of such Scheduled Mortgage
Principal Payments remaining through the current Maturity Date; and

                  (iv)     On each Payment Date prior to the Payment Date in
December 2003, if Mortgage Lender's Percentage of Excess Cash Flow in any month
exceeds the Scheduled Mortgage Principal Payment for such month, such excess
amount shall be paid to Lender and applied to principal on the Loan until the
amount of any Amortization Deficiency has been reduced to zero, and any
remainder Excess Cash Flow thereafter shall be distributed in accordance with
the terms of the Cash Management Agreement; and

                  (v)      At any time the then Aggregate Outstanding Principal
Balance is less than $90,812,257.80, Mortgage Lender's Percentage of Excess Cash
Flow shall be paid to Lender and applied on each Payment Date in reduction of
the principal balance of the Loan (which payment shall be made without the
imposition of any Prepayment Consideration).

         (B)      DATE AND TIME OF PAYMENT. The Borrowers shall receive credit
for payments on the Loan which are transferred to the account of Lender as

payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day.

         (C)      MANNER OF PAYMENT; APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. The Borrowers
promise to pay all of the Obligations relating to the Loan as such amounts
become due or are declared due pursuant to the terms of this Loan Agreement. All
payments by the Borrowers on the Loan shall be made without deduction, defense,
set off or counterclaim and in immediately available funds delivered to Lender
by wire transfer to such accounts at such banks as Lender may from time to time
designate. Prior to an Event of Default, each payment shall be applied first to
pay late charges and the charges and expenses of Lender, Servicer and any
special servicer as provided hereunder, second to accrued and unpaid interest,
and the balance to principal. Prior to an Event of Default, to the extent
sufficient funds are contained in the Lock Box Account, or an Account or
Sub-Account thereof, to make the required monthly payments to the applicable
Reserves and Sub-Account on such Payment Date, the Borrowers shall be deemed to
have satisfied its obligation to make such payments. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, payments shall be applied to the
Obligations in such order as Lender shall determine in its sole and absolute
discretion.

                           expiration of the Second Extension Term, as the case
                           may be, is at least equal to the Minimum DSCR, and
                           the Debt Yield for the twelve (12) month period ended
                           on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar
                           quarter prior to the expiration of the First
                           Extension Term, or expiration of the Second Extension
                           Term, as the case may be, is not less than 13.25%;
                           provided however, if the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
                           and/or the Debt Yield fail to satisfy such
                           requirements, the Borrowers shall be entitled to make
                           a principal prepayment of a portion of the Aggregate
                           Outstanding Principal Balance (to be applied in
                           accordance with the terms of the Cash Management
                           Agreement) on the then current Maturity Date in an
                           amount, as reasonably determined by Lender,
                           sufficient to cause the Debt Service Coverage Ratio
                           and/or the Debt Yield, as applicable, to satisfy such
                           requirements based upon a recalculation thereof
                           assuming that the prepayment amount were applied to
                           reduce the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance as
                           of the last day of the immediately preceding calendar
                           quarter (and provided that the Prepayment
                           Consideration shall be payable in connection with
                           such prepayment);

                  (iv)     Prior to the date the applicable Extension Term
                           commences, the Borrowers shall deliver to Lender an
                           extension fee equal to one quarter of one percent
                           (.25%) of the outstanding principal balance of the
                           Loan as of the date the applicable Extension Term
                           commences for each of the Second Extension Term and
                           the Third Extension Term;

                  (v)      All of the conditions required to be satisfied for
                           the extension of the Mezzanine Loan pursuant to
                           Section 2.5(B)(viii) thereof (whether or not the
                           Mezzanine Loan is actually extended) shall have been
                           satisfied;

                  (vi)     The Borrowers shall execute all such documents and
                           other agreements as Lender shall reasonably request;

                  (vii)    The Borrowers shall deliver to Lender an extension of
                           the Cap or a replacement Cap in form substantially
                           the same as the Cap delivered at Closing covering the
                           term of the applicable Extension Term, providing for
                           a cap "strike price" (such "strike price", the
                           "EXTENSION CAP THRESHOLD RATE") not greater than six
                           and one-half percent (6.5%) per annum (it being
                           acknowledged that the Borrowers may purchase an
                           extension or replacement Cap for the applicable
                           Extension Term with an Extension Cap Threshold Rate
                           lower than such rate in order to satisfy the Debt
                           Service Coverage Ratio requirement under Section
                           2.5(B)(iii) above) and otherwise satisfying the
                           requirements of Section 2.3 together with an
                           assignment of such replacement Cap substantially in
                           the form of the Assignment of Rate Cap and such
                           Financing Statements and opinions of in-house or
                           outside counsel to the Cap Provider as Lender may
                           reasonably require each in form and substance
                           reasonably acceptable to Lender. The Borrowers shall
                           be required to pay any and all reasonable
                           out-of-pocket

                                       31

                           costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
                           reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements)
                           incurred by Lender (and by any Servicer and trustee
                           in connection with any Securitization backed in whole
                           or in part by the Loan) in connection with delivery
                           of such extension or replacement Cap and all related
                           documentation and opinions required above; and

                  (viii)   The Borrowers shall have delivered evidence
                           reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the
                           environmental insurance, including mold coverage, in
                           form and with coverages in effect as of the Closing
                           Date has been renewed through the end of the
                           applicable Extension Term.

SECTION 2.6       PREPAYMENT.

         (A)      LIMITATION ON PREPAYMENT; PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION DUE ON
ACCELERATION. The Borrowers shall have no right to prepay the Loan in whole or
part, except as expressly set forth in this Loan Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. The Borrowers may prepay the Loan in whole, or, to the extent
expressly provided herein, in part, at any time, provided that (i) the Borrowers
shall provide to Lender not less than fifteen (15) days prior written notice of
such prepayment, (ii) together with such prepayment the Borrowers also shall pay
all accrued and unpaid interest and all other Obligations then due and owing and
(iii) if such prepayment occurs on any day other than a Payment Date, then
together therewith the Borrowers also shall pay to Lender the amount of interest
that would have accrued on the amount being prepaid from and including the date
of such prepayment to the end of such Interest Accrual Period.

         (B)      PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION DUE. If any prepayment of all or any
portion of the Loan shall occur on account of acceleration of the Loan (whether
or not due to an Event of Default), or otherwise, then except only as expressly
provided in this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, the
Borrowers shall pay the Prepayment Consideration on the amount prepaid to Lender
together with such prepayment, as liquidated damages and compensation for costs
incurred, and in addition to all other amounts due and owing to Lender.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Prepayment Consideration will be due as to a
prepayment of the Loan in connection with (i) application of insurance or
condemnation proceeds required by Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the
Deeds of Trust in the absence of an Event of Default, (ii) amortization payments
made in accordance with Section 2.4(A), (iii) in connection with the first
$36,324,903.12 of prepayments made in connection with one or more Releases (it
being agreed that the Prepayment Consideration will be due with respect to all,
or any portion of, a prepayment made in connection with a Release after the
aggregate amount of all prepayments made in connection with Releases (other than
Releases effectuated pursuant to Section 5.5(E)) exceeds $36,324,903.12, or (iv)
upon prepayment of the Loan in full, on any date on or after the Payment Date
occurring in October 2004, through the Scheduled Maturity Date (provided the
amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount being prepaid from and
including the date of such prepayment through the following Payment Date shall
be payable with such prepayment). The foregoing designation of any amount of
Prepayment Consideration in this Agreement shall not create a right to prepay at
any time or in any circumstances where this Agreement does not expressly state
that such a right exists. "PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATION" shall mean an amount equal
to (i) prior to the Payment Date in December 2003, three percent (3%) of the
Loan balance at the time of prepayment, and (ii) on and after the Payment Date
in December

                                       32

<PAGE>

2003, but prior to the Payment Date in May 2004, two percent (2%) of the Loan
balance at the time of prepayment, and (iii) thereafter through the Scheduled
Maturity Date one percent (1%) of the Loan balance at the time of prepayment.

SECTION  2.7      OUTSTANDING BALANCE. The balance on Lender's books and records
shall be presumptive evidence (absent manifest error) of the amounts owing to
Lender by the Borrowers; provided that any failure to record any transaction
affecting such balance or any error in so recording shall not limit or otherwise
affect the Borrowers' obligation to pay the Obligations.

SECTION 2.8       TAXES. Any and all payments or reimbursements made hereunder
or under the Note shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any
and all taxes, withholding taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto arising out of or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (all such
taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings and all liabilities
with respect thereto (excluding taxes imposed on net income in accordance with
the following sentence) herein "TAX LIABILITIES"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Borrowers shall not be liable for taxes imposed on the net income
of Lender by the jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is organized or
doing business or any political subdivision thereof and taxes imposed on its net
income by the jurisdiction of Lender's applicable lending office or any
political subdivision thereof. If the Borrowers shall be required by law to
deduct any such Tax Liabilities (or amounts in estimation or reimbursement for
the same) from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to Lender, then the
sum payable hereunder shall be increased as may be necessary so that, after
making all required deduction, Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made.

SECTION 2.9       REASONABLENESS OF CHARGES. The Borrower Parties agree that (i)
the actual costs and damages that Lender would suffer by reason of an Event of
Default (exclusive of the attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in connection
with enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents) or a prepayment
would be difficult and needlessly expensive to calculate and establish, and (ii)
the amounts of the Default Rate, the late charges, and the Prepayment
Consideration are reasonable, taking into consideration the circumstances known
to the parties at this time, and (iii) such Default Rate and late charges and
Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with enforcement of Lender's rights under the Loan Documents shall be
due and payable as provided herein, and (iv) such interest at the Default Rate,
late charges, Prepayment Consideration, and the obligation to pay Lender's
reasonable attorneys' fees and other enforcement costs do not, individually or
collectively, constitute a penalty.

SECTION 2.10      FUNDING LOSSES/CHANGE IN LAW ETC.

         (A)      The Borrowers hereby agree to pay to Lender any amount
necessary to compensate Lender and any Funding Party for any losses or costs
(including, without limitation, the costs of breaking any "LIBOR" contract, if
applicable, or funding losses determined on the basis of Lender's or such
Funding Party's reinvestment rate and the interest rate on the Loan)
(collectively, "FUNDING LOSSES") sustained by Lender or any Funding Party: (i)
if the Note, or any portion thereof, is repaid for any reason whatsoever on any
date other than a Payment Date (including, without limitation, from condemnation
or insurance proceeds); or (ii) as a

                                       33

<PAGE>

consequence of (x) any increased cost of funds that Lender or any Funding Party
may sustain in maintaining the borrowing evidenced hereby or (y) the reduction
of any amounts received or receivable from the Borrowers, in either case, due to
the introduction of, or any change in, law or applicable regulation or treaty
adopted after the date hereof (including the administration or interpretation
thereof), whether or not having the force of law, or due to the compliance by
Lender or the Funding Party, as the case may be, with any directive, whether or
not having the force of law, or request from any central bank or domestic or
foreign governmental authority, agency or instrumentality having jurisdiction
made as of the date hereof, to the extent Lender reasonably determines that such
Funding Losses are allocable to the Loan.

         (B)      If Lender or any Funding Party shall have determined that the
applicability of any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted pursuant to or
arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled "International Convergence of
Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the adoption of any other law,
rule, regulation or guideline (including but not limited to any United States
law, rule, regulation or guideline) regarding capital adequacy, or any change
becoming effective in any of the foregoing or in the enforcement or
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any court or any
domestic or foreign governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency
charged with the enforcement or interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by Lender or its holding company or a Funding Party or its holding
company, as the case may be, with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency made after the date hereof, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of Lender or its holding
company, or of the Funding Party's or its holding company, as the case may be,
then, upon demand by Lender, the Borrowers shall pay to Lender, from time to
time, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate Lender or such
Funding Party for any such reduction suffered.

         (C)      Any amount payable by the Borrowers under Section 2.10(A) or
2.10(B) shall be paid to Lender within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt
by the Borrowers of a certificate signed by an officer of Lender setting forth
the amount due and the basis for the determination of such amount in reasonable
detail and the computations made by Lender to determine the amount due, which
statement shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrowers, absent manifest
error. Failure on the part of Lender to demand payment from the Borrowers for
any such amount attributable to any particular period shall not constitute a
waiver of Lender's right to demand payment of such amount for any subsequent or
prior period. Lender shall use reasonable efforts to deliver to the Borrowers
prompt notice of any event described in Sections 2.10(A) or 2.10(B) above and of
the amount to be paid as a result thereof, provided, however, any failure by
Lender to so notify the Borrowers shall not affect the Borrower's obligation to
make the payments to be made under this Section as a result thereof. All amounts
which may become due and payable by the Borrowers in accordance with the
provisions of this Section shall constitute additional interest under the Loan
and shall be secured by the Deeds of Trust and the other Loan Documents.

         (D)      If Lender or any Funding Party requests compensation for any
losses or costs to be reimbursed pursuant to any one or more of the provisions
of clause (ii) of Sections 2.10(A) or 2.10(B), then, upon request of the
Borrowers, Lender or such Funding Party shall use reasonable efforts in a manner
consistent with such institution's practice in connection with loans like the

                                       34

<PAGE>

Loan to eliminate, mitigate or reduce amounts that would otherwise be payable by
the Borrowers under the foregoing provisions, provided that such action would
not be otherwise prejudicial to Lender or such Funding Party, including, without
limitation, by designating another of Lender's or such Funding Party's offices,
branches or affiliates; the Borrowers hereby agreeing to pay all reasonably
incurred costs and expenses incurred by Lender or any Funding Party in
connection with any such action.

SECTION 2.11 SERVICING/SPECIAL SERVICING. Lender may change the Servicer from
time to time without the consent of the Borrowers, on prior written notice to
the Borrowers. The Borrowers expressly acknowledge and agree that the Servicer's
fees (the "SERVICING FEE"), which shall in no event exceed .05% per annum on the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan, payable in monthly installments, and
if the Loan becomes a specially serviced loan, any fees of the special servicer,
shall be payable by the Borrowers and shall constitute a portion of the
Obligations; provided, however, that at no time shall the Borrowers be liable
for Servicing Fees or special servicing fees in excess of those fees charged to
Lender by the Servicer or any special servicer.

                                   ARTICLE III
                               CONDITIONS TO LOAN

Default exists; (ii) no material adverse change in the financial condition or
operations of the business of the Borrowers or the projected cash flow of the
Borrowers or the Properties has occurred since the delivery to Lender of any
financial statements, budgets, proformas, or similar materials (or if there has

Knowledge after due inquiry, such financial materials fairly present the
financial condition and results of operations of the Borrowers and the
Properties, and all other materials delivered to Lender are complete and
accurate in all material respects; and (iii) the representations and warranties
set forth in this Loan Agreement are true and correct in all material respects

certain other Affiliates of the Borrower Parties specified by Lender. Also on or

Member (including the Independent Directors), or the unanimous prior written

with their terms; (2) under Delaware law the bankruptcy or dissolution of Member
would not cause the dissolution of any of the Borrowers and the bankruptcy or
dissolution of the sole shareholder or member would not cause the dissolution of
Member; (3) under Delaware law, creditors of Member shall have no legal or
equitable remedies with respect to the assets of any of the Borrowers and
creditors of Guarantor shall have no legal or equitable remedies with respect to
the assets of Member; and (4) a federal bankruptcy court would hold that
Delaware law governs the determination of what Persons have authority to file a
voluntary bankruptcy petition on behalf of each Borrower and Member; and (d)
such other legal opinions as Lender may reasonably request.

         (F)      TITLE POLICIES. On or before the Closing Date, Lender shall
have received and approved pro forma Title Policies for the Deeds of Trust, and
as of the Closing, each Title Company shall be irrevocably committed and
prepared immediately to issue the Title Policies or binding commitments. The
Title Policies shall be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender. Without
limitation, each Title Policy shall be issued on an ALTA form acceptable to
Lender by each Title Company or if an ALTA form is not available in the
applicable jurisdiction, another form acceptable to Lender, together with such
reinsurance and direct access agreements as Lender may require, insuring that
the Deeds of Trust are valid first and prior enforceable liens on each
Borrower's fee simple interest or ground leasehold interest, as the case may be,

only to such exceptions to coverage as are acceptable to Lender, including the
Permitted Exceptions. Each Title Policy shall contain such endorsements as
Lender may require (to the extent available in the state where the Properties is
located) in form acceptable to Lender, including deletion of the creditors'
rights exception and affirmative endorsement coverage for creditors' rights
risks.

each Title Company by a surveyor reasonably satisfactory to Lender (the
"SURVEY"). Each Survey shall contain the minimum detail for land surveys as most

<PAGE>

         (C)      ORGANIZATION. The organizational chart set forth as SCHEDULE

SECTION 4.3 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. To the Borrowers' Knowledge after due inquiry,
all financial statements concerning any of the Borrowers, their Affiliates and
the Properties which have been furnished by or on behalf of the Borrowers to
Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied (except as disclosed therein) and present fairly the
financial condition of the Persons covered thereby as at the dates thereof and
the results of their operations for the periods then ended. Since the date of
the financial

                                       41

<PAGE>

statements delivered to Lender, there has been no material adverse change in the
financial condition, operations or business of the Borrower Parties or the
Properties from that set forth in said financial statements.

SECTION 4.4 INDEBTEDNESS AND CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS. As of the Closing, except
as previously disclosed to and approved by Lender in writing and set forth on
SCHEDULE 4.4, the Borrowers shall have no outstanding Indebtedness or
Contingent Obligations other than the Obligations or any other Permitted
Indebtedness.

SECTION 4.5 TITLE TO THE PROPERTIES. The Borrowers have good and marketable fee
simple title (or, in the case of the Ground Leased Properties, leasehold title)
to the Properties, free and clear of all Liens except for the Permitted
Encumbrances. The Borrowers own and will own at all times all FF&E relating to
the Properties (other than personal property which is either owned by tenants of
such Property, not used or necessary for the operation of the applicable
Property, or leased by the Borrowers as permitted hereunder), subject only to
the Permitted Encumbrances. The Deeds of Trust, when properly recorded in the
appropriate records, together with any Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will create (i) a
valid, perfected first lien on each of the Properties, subject only to the
Permitted Encumbrances, and (ii) perfected first priority security interests in
and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all personalty (including the
Rents and the Leases), all in accordance with the terms thereof, in each case
subject only to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances. Lender will have a
perfected first priority security interest in and to the FF&E owned by the
Borrower, if any, not located at the Properties. To the Borrowers' Knowledge,
except as set forth in SCHEDULE 4.5, there are no proceedings in condemnation or
eminent domain affecting any of the Properties, and to the actual knowledge of
the Borrower, none is threatened. No Person has any option or other right to
purchase all or any portion of any of the Properties or any interest therein. To
the Borrowers' Knowledge, there are no mechanic's, materialman's or other
similar liens or claims which have been filed for work, labor or materials
affecting the Properties which are or will be liens prior to, or equal or
coordinate with, the lien of any of the Deeds of Trust. None of the Permitted
Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the
benefits of the security intended to be provided by the Deeds of Trust and this
Loan Agreement, materially and adversely affect the value of any of the
Properties, impair the use or operations of the Properties or impair the
Borrower's ability to pay its obligations in a timely manner.

SECTION 4.6 ZONING; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.6,
to the Borrower's Knowledge, the Properties and the use thereof comply in all
material respects with all applicable zoning, subdivision and land use laws,
regulations and ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to the Properties,
or any of them, including without limitation the Americans with Disabilities
Act. To the Borrowers' knowledge, there are no illegal activities relating to
controlled substances on any of the Properties. All material permits, licenses
and certificates for the lawful use, occupancy and operation of each component
of each of the Properties in the manner in which it is currently being used,
occupied and operated, including, but not limited to liquor licenses and
certificates of occupancy, or the equivalent, have been obtained and are current
and in full force and effect. To the Borrower's Knowledge, except as disclosed
on SCHEDULE 4.6, in the event that all or any part of the Improvements located
on any

                                       42

<PAGE>

Property is destroyed or damaged, said Improvements can be legally reconstructed
to their condition prior to such damage or destruction, and thereafter exist for
the same use without violating any zoning or other ordinances applicable thereto
and without the necessity of obtaining any variances or special permits, other
than customary demolition, building and other construction related permits. To
the Borrowers' Knowledge, no legal proceedings are pending or threatened with
respect to the zoning of any Property. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, except as
set forth in the Title Policies and/or the Surveys, neither the zoning nor any
other right to construct, use or operate any Property is in any way dependent
upon or related to any real estate other than such Property. No tract map,
parcel map, condominium plan, condominium declaration, or plat of subdivision
will be recorded by the Borrowers with respect to any Property without Lender's
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

Lender in the estoppel certificates delivered to Lender at Closing, to the
Borrowers' Knowledge, (i) the Material Leases are in full force and effect; (ii)
the Borrowers have not given any notice of default to any tenant under any Lease
which remains uncured; (iii) no tenant has any set off, claim or defense to the
enforcement of any Lease; (iv) no tenant is in arrears in the payment of rent,

such Rent Roll. There are no legal proceedings commenced (or, to the Knowledge
of the Borrowers, threatened) against the Borrowers by any tenant or former
tenant. No rental in excess of one month's rent has been prepaid under any of

true and complete copy of each of the Management Agreements to which they are a
party that will be in effect on the Closing Date, and such Management Agreements

Knowledge no part of any of the Properties is within a flood plain and none of
the Improvements create encroachment over, across or upon the Properties'
boundary lines, rights of way or easements, and no building or other
improvements on adjoining land create such an encroachment which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All public roads and
streets necessary for service of and access to each of the Properties for the
current and contemplated uses thereof have been completed and are serviceable
and are physically and legally open for use by the public. To the Borrowers'
Knowledge after due inquiry, and except as disclosed in the Property Condition

                                       44

<PAGE>

reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. To the Borrowers'
Knowledge after due inquiry, the actions, charges, claims, demand, suits,
proceedings, petitions, investigations and arbitrations set forth on SCHEDULE
4.9 are not reasonably expected to result, either individually or in the
aggregate, in any Material Adverse Effect.

governmental charges (including any payments in lieu of taxes) upon such Person

special assessment against any of the Properties or any part thereof.

SECTION 4.11 ADVERSE CONTRACTS. Except for the Loan Documents, none of the
Primary Borrower Parties is a party to or bound by, nor is any property of such
Person subject to or bound by, any contract or other agreement which restricts

currently conducted that, either individually or in the aggregate, has a
Material Adverse Effect or could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.12 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS. To the Borrowers' Knowledge, no Borrower
Party is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation of
any such Person which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, and no condition exists that, with the giving of notice or the lapse of
time or both, would constitute such a default which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 4.13 GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION. No Primary Borrower Party is subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal

SECTION 4.17 SOLVENCY. The Borrowers (a) have not entered into the transaction
or any Loan Document with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any

<PAGE>

following the making of the Loan, exceed such Borrower's total liabilities,
including, without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and
Contingent Obligations. The fair saleable value of each Borrower's assets is and
will, immediately following the making of the Loan, be greater than the
Borrower's probable liabilities, including the maximum amount of its Contingent
Obligations on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Each
Borrower's assets do not and, immediately following the making of the Loan will
not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as
conducted or as proposed to be conducted. The Borrowers do not intend to, and do
not believe that they will, incur Indebtedness and liabilities (including
Contingent Obligations and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such
Indebtedness and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing and
amounts of cash to be received by the Borrowers and the amounts to be payable on
or in respect of obligations of the Borrowers).

behalf of any Primary Borrower Party contains any untrue representation,
warranty or statement of a material fact, or omits to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not misleading. No
Loan Document or any other document, certificate or written statement for use in
connection with the Loan and prepared by any Borrower Party, or any information
provided by any Borrower Party and contained in, or used in preparation of, any
document or certificate for use in connection with the Loan, contains any untrue
representation, warranty or statement of a material fact, or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading. There is no material fact actually known to the Borrowers that has
had or will have a Material Adverse Effect and that has not been disclosed in
writing to Lender by the Borrowers.

SECTION 4.19 USE OF PROCEEDS AND MARGIN SECURITY. The Borrowers shall use the
proceeds of the Loan only for the purposes set forth herein and consistent with
all applicable laws, statues, rules and regulations. No portion of the proceeds
of the Loan shall be used by the Borrowers or any Person in any manner that
might cause the borrowing or the application of such proceeds to violate
Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X or any other regulation of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

description of all policies of insurance for each Borrower that are in effect as

requirements of Lender. If any such budget or plan requiring Lender's approval
is not approved or deemed approved by the beginning of the calendar year covered
thereby, the applicable budget or plan for the previous year shall remain in
effect until the new budget or plan is approved or deemed approved. Lender's
consent to any budget, plan or amendments thereto shall be deemed given, if the
first correspondence from the Borrowers to Lender requesting such approval is in

properties or assets (hereinafter referred to as the "CLAIMS"); and (iii) all

each instance before any penalty or fine is incurred with respect thereto.

         (B)      The Borrowers shall not be required to pay, discharge or
remove any Imposition or Claim relating to a Property so long as the Borrowers
contest in good faith such Imposition, Claim or the validity, applicability or
amount thereof by an appropriate legal proceeding which operates to prevent the
collection of such amounts and the sale of the applicable Property or any
portion thereof, so long as: (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (ii) prior to the date on which such Imposition or Claim would
otherwise have become delinquent, the Borrowers shall have given Lender prior
written notice of their intent to contest said Imposition or Claim; (iii) prior

or Claim then remaining unpaid, and (y) all interest, penalties, costs and
charges accrued or accumulated thereon; (iv) no risk of sale, forfeiture or loss
of any interest in the

                                       53

applicable Property or any part thereof arises, in Lender's reasonable judgment,
during the pendency of such contest; (v) such contest does not, in Lender's
reasonable determination, have a Material Adverse Effect; and (vi) such contest
is based on bona fide, material, and reasonable claims or defenses. Any such
contest shall be prosecuted with due diligence, and the Borrowers shall promptly
pay the amount of such Imposition or Claim as finally determined, together with
all interest and penalties payable in connection therewith. Lender shall have
full power and authority, but no obligation, to apply any amount deposited with
Lender under this subsection to the payment of any unpaid Imposition or Claim to
prevent the sale or forfeiture of the applicable Property for non-payment
thereof, if Lender reasonably believes that such sale or forfeiture is
threatened. Any surplus retained by Lender after payment of the Imposition or
Claim for which a deposit was made shall be promptly repaid to the Borrowers
unless an Event of Default shall have occurred, in which case said surplus may
be retained by Lender to be applied to the Obligations. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Section to the contrary, the Borrowers shall pay any
Imposition or Claim which they might otherwise be entitled to contest if an
Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, or if, in the reasonable
determination of Lender, the applicable Property is in danger of being forfeited
or foreclosed. If the Borrowers refuses to pay any such Imposition or Claim,
Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) make such payment and the Borrowers
shall reimburse Lender on demand for all such advances.

Borrowers shall cause such tenant to cause liquor liability insurance in an
amount not less than $2,000,000 to be carried in such tenant's name, and shall
include the Borrowers and Lender as additional insureds thereunder;

                  (xiv)    Environmental insurance, including mold coverage, in
form and with coverages (including business interruption coverage) reasonably
satisfactory to Lender;

                                       55

<PAGE>

                  (xv)     Fiduciary liability insurance and directors and
officers liability insurance ("D&O INSURANCE") with coverages at levels in
effect as of the Closing Date;

                  (xvi)    Such other insurance as may from time to time be
reasonably required by Lender and which is then customarily required by
institutional lenders for securitized loans secured by similar properties
similarly situated, against other insurable hazards, including, but not limited
to, malicious mischief, vandalism, windstorm and or earthquake, due regard to be
given to the size and type of the Properties, Improvements, fixtures and
equipment and their location, construction and use. Additionally, the Borrowers
shall carry such insurance coverage as Lender may from time to time require if
the failure to carry such insurance would result in a downgrade, qualification
or withdrawal of any class of securities issued in connection with a
Securitization. Notwithstanding the provision of this subsection (xv), any
terrorism insurance required to be obtained by the Borrowers shall be subject to
the provisions of subsection (xvi) below;

                  (xvii)   To the extent any of the commercial property
insurance policies required under subsection (i), (ii), (v), or (vi) above (each
a "REQUIRED INSURANCE POLICY," collectively, the "REQUIRED INSURANCE POLICIES"),
or any renewal or replacement of any Required Insurance Policy, either does not
include or specifically excludes coverage for damage resulting from terrorism
with coverages as provided in the Required Insurance Policies delivered to
Lender in connection with the origination of the Loan (collectively, the
"EXCLUSIONS FROM COVERAGE"), the Borrowers shall either (x) obtain an
endorsement to any such Required Insurance Policy or (y) maintain a separate
insurance policy, in each case insuring against any damage resulting from such
Exclusions from Coverage to the same extent each of the Required Insurance
Policies would have provided such coverage had each Required Insurance Policy
not contained an exclusion for such Exclusions from Coverage, in each case on
terms consistent with the insurance policies required under subsections (i),
(ii), (v), and (vi) above; provided that the cost for omission of such
exclusions from any such policies, or separate insurance, shall not exceed the
Terrorism Insurance Cap, in which instance the Borrowers shall obtain such
maximum coverage as is available for the Terrorism Insurance Cap. Such insurance
may, at the option of the Borrowers, be effected by a blanket policy of
insurance issued to the Borrowers covering the Properties and other property,
provided that, in each case, (A) such blanket policy is acceptable to Lender in
its reasonable discretion (taking into account, by way of example only, such
matters as the type and location of the other properties named in such blanket
policy) and (B) such policy otherwise complies with the provisions of this Loan
Agreement and allocates to the Properties, at all times that any portion of the
Obligations remains outstanding, the coverage specified by this Loan Agreement,
without possibility of reduction or coinsurance by reason of, or damage to, any
other property (real or personal) named therein. Lender's prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, shall be required prior to the
Borrowers' addition of any property to any such blanket policy. If such
insurance shall be effected by such blanket policy, the Borrowers shall furnish
to Lender an original policy or certified copy thereof, and an original
certificate of insurance together with reasonable access to the original of such
policy to review such policy's coverage of the Properties, with schedules
attached thereto showing the amount of the insurance provided under such
policies applicable to the Properties.

         All Insurance Policies shall be in content (including, without
limitation, endorsements or exclusions, if any), form, and amounts, and issued
by companies, satisfactory to Lender from

                                       56

<PAGE>

time to time and shall name Lender and its successors and assignees as their
interests may appear as (x) an "additional insured" for each of the liability
policies under this Section 5.4 hereof, and (y) a "mortgagee" for each of the
property and casualty policies under this Section hereof, and shall (except for
Worker's Compensation Insurance) contain a waiver of subrogation clause
reasonably acceptable to Lender. Other than with respect to D&O Insurance, an
insurance company shall not be satisfactory unless such insurance company (a) is
licensed or authorized to issue insurance in the State where the applicable
Property is located and (b) has a claims paying ability rating by the Rating
Agencies of AA- (or its equivalent). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a carrier
which does not meet the foregoing ratings requirement shall nevertheless be
deemed acceptable hereunder provided that such carrier is reasonably acceptable
to Lender and the Borrowers shall obtain and deliver to Lender a Rating
Confirmation with respect to such carrier from each of the Rating Agencies,
provided, however, if any insurance coverage required under this Section 5.4 is
maintained by a syndicate of insurers, the preceding ratings requirements shall
be deemed satisfied (without any required Rating Confirmation) as long as at
least seventy five percent (75%) of the coverage (if there are four or fewer
members of the syndicate) or at least sixty percent (60%) of the coverage (if
there are five or more members of the syndicate) is maintained with carriers
meeting the claims-paying ability ratings requirements by S&P and Moody's (if
applicable) set forth above and all carriers in such syndicate have a
claims-paying ability rating by S&P of not less than "BBB" and by Moody's of not
less than "Baa2" (to the extent rated by Moody's). All Insurance Policies under
Sections 5.4 (i), (iv), (vi), (vii), (x), (xi) and (xii) hereof shall contain a
Non-Contributory Standard mortgagee clause and a mortgagee's Loss Payable
Endorsement (Form 438 BFU NS), or their equivalents (such endorsements shall
entitle Lender to collect any and all proceeds payable under all such insurance,
with the insurance company waiving any claim or defense against Lender for
premium payment, deductible, self-insured retention or claims reporting
provisions). All Insurance Policies shall provide that the coverage shall not be
modified without (30) days' advance written notice to Lender and shall provide
that no claims shall be paid thereunder to a Person other than Lender without
ten (10) day's advance written notice to Lender. The Borrowers may obtain any
insurance required by this Section through blanket policies; provided, however,
that such blanket policies shall separately set forth the amount of insurance in
force with respect to the Properties (which shall not be reduced by reason of
events occurring on property other than the Properties) and shall afford all the
protections to Lender as are required under this Section. Except as may be
expressly provided above, all policies of insurance required hereunder shall
contain no annual aggregate limit of liability, other than with respect to
liability insurance. If a blanket policy is issued, a certified copy of said
policy shall be furnished, together with a certificate indicating that Lender is
an additional insured (and, if applicable, loss payee) under such policy in the
designated amount. The Borrowers will deliver duplicate originals of all
Insurance Policies, premium prepaid for a period of one (1) year, to Lender and,
in case of Insurance Policies about to expire, the Borrowers will deliver
duplicate originals of replacement policies satisfying the requirements hereof
to Lender not less than thirty (30) days prior to the date of expiration;
provided, however, if such replacement policy is not yet available, the
Borrowers shall provide Lender with an insurance certificate executed by the
insurer or its authorized agent evidencing that the insurance required hereunder
is being maintained under such policy, which certificate shall be acceptable to
Lender on an interim basis until the duplicate original of the policy is
available. The Borrowers shall furnish Lender receipts for the payment of
premiums on such insurance policies or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to Lender in the

                                       57

<PAGE>

event that such premiums have not been paid by Lender pursuant to the Loan
Agreement. The requirements of this Section 5.4 shall apply to any separate
policies of insurance taken out by the Borrowers concurrent in form or
contributing in the event of loss with the Insurance Policies. Losses shall be
payable to Lender notwithstanding (1) any act, failure to act or negligence of
the Borrowers or their agents or employees, Lender or any other insured party
which might, absent such agreement, result in a forfeiture or all or part of
such insurance payment, other than the willful misconduct of Lender knowingly in
violation of the conditions of such policy, (2) the occupation or use of the
Properties or any part thereof for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the
terms of such policy, (3) any foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken
pursuant to this Loan Agreement or (4) any change in title to or ownership of
the Properties or any part thereof. The property insurance and the boiler and
machinery insurance described in Sections 5.4(i) and (x) hereof shall include
"underground hazards" coverage; "time element" coverage by which Lender shall be
assured payment of all amounts due under the Note, this Loan Agreement and the
other Loan Documents; "extra expense" (i.e., soft costs), clean-up, transit and
ordinary payroll coverage; and "expediting expense" coverage to facilitate rapid
repair or restoration of the Properties. The Insurance Policies shall not
contain any deductible in excess of $250,000.

         Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.4 to the contrary,
Lender acknowledges that the Borrowers's insurance in effect as of the Closing
Date, and as described on SCHEDULE 4.20 are acceptable to Lender as of the
Closing Date, and shall continue to be acceptable to Lender for so long as (x)
the Borrowers do not change such insurance companies, and (y) no downgrade has
occurred to the ratings in effect as of the Closing Date for each such insurance
company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than five (5) Business Days
prior to the expiration of each of the Insurance Policies in effect as of the
Closing Date, the Borrowers shall deliver to Lender replacements of each such
Insurance Policy which provides coverage required hereunder for a period of one
(1) year, together with evidence of the payment in full of the annual premium(s)
payable for such policy.

SECTION 5.5 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTIES; CASUALTY.

         (A)      The Borrowers will operate and maintain the Properties as is
necessary to maintain hotel standards at least as high as those that currently
apply to each Property, subject to ordinary wear and tear, as reasonably
determined by the Borrowers, and otherwise in compliance with the standards
under the applicable Franchise Agreement and shall maintain or cause to be
maintained in good repair, working order and condition all material property
used in the business of each Borrower, including the applicable Property, and
will make or cause to be made all appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements
thereof. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Borrower will operate and
maintain its Property substantially in accordance with the applicable Operating
Budget and the CapEx/FF&E Budget. All work required or permitted under this Loan
Agreement shall be performed in a workmanlike manner and in compliance with all
applicable laws.

         So long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Borrowers may, without Lender's consent, perform alterations to the Properties
which do not constitute a Material Alteration. The Borrowers shall not perform
any Material Alteration without Lender's prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;

                                       58

<PAGE>

provided, however, that Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
withhold consent to any Material Alteration which is likely to result in a
decrease of Net Operating Income (taking into consideration all Material
Alterations being undertaken at the Properties at such time) by 5% or more below
that which was in effect prior to the commencement of the first such Material
Alteration being undertaken at the time of determination for a period of sixty
(60) days or longer; provided, further, however, the Borrowers may perform a
Material Alteration without Lender's consent if (i) the delay caused by
obtaining Lender's prior consent may result in injury or death at, or further
destruction or deterioration of, the applicable Property, (ii) such Material
Alteration is necessary to prevent the likelihood of injury or death at, or
further destruction or deterioration of, the applicable Property, and (iii) the
Borrowers deliver notice to Lender within two (2) Business Days of commencement
of such Material Alteration together with such supporting documentation as
Lender may require with respect to such Material Alteration. Lender may, as a
condition to giving its consent to a Material Alteration, require that the
Borrowers deliver to Lender evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender that the
Borrowers have cash available for payment of the cost of such Material
Alteration or, if the Borrowers fail to deliver such evidence, cash, Dollar
Equivalents or a Letter of Credit, in an amount equal to 125% of the cost of
such Material Alteration as reasonably estimated by Lender. Cash deposited by
the Borrowers with Lender in connection with any Material Alteration pursuant to
the foregoing sentence shall be held by Lender in a Sub-Account of the Lock Box
Account and disbursed to the Borrowers to pay for the cost of such Material
Alteration as such work progresses subject to satisfaction of the conditions for
disbursement of amounts from the FF&E Reserve under Section 6.4 (including the
requirements set forth under Section 6.7). Upon completion of the Material
Alteration, the Borrowers shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Lender that (i) the Material Alteration was constructed in accordance with all
material applicable laws and substantially in accordance with plans and
specifications approved by Lender (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), (ii) all contractors, subcontractors, materialmen and
professionals who provided work, materials or services in connection with the
Material Alteration have been paid in full and have delivered unconditional
releases of lien and (iii) all material licenses necessary for the use,
operation and occupancy of the Material Alteration (other than those which
depend on the performance of tenant improvement work) have been issued. The
Borrowers shall reimburse Lender upon demand for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including the reasonable fees of any architect, engineer or
other professional engaged by Lender) incurred by Lender in reviewing plans and
specifications or in making any determinations necessary to implement the
provisions of this Section 5.5(A).

         (B)      In the event of casualty or loss at any of the Properties, the
Borrowers shall give immediate written notice of the same to the insurance
carrier and to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute to
completion, in accordance with the terms hereof, the repair and restoration of
the Property as nearly as possible to the Pre-Existing Condition (a
"RESTORATION"). The Borrowers hereby authorize and empower Lender as
attorney-in-fact for the Borrowers (jointly with the Borrowers unless an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing), or any of them, to make proof of
loss, to adjust and compromise any claim under insurance policies, to appear in
and prosecute any action arising from such insurance policies, to collect and
receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct therefrom Lender's expenses incurred
in the collection of such proceeds; provided however, that nothing contained in
this Section shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action
hereunder. The Borrowers further authorize Lender, at Lender's option, (i) to
hold the balance of such proceeds to be used to

                                       59

<PAGE>

reimburse the Borrowers for the cost of Restoration of any of the Properties or
(ii) subject to Subsection 5.5(C), to apply such proceeds to payment of the
Obligations whether or not then due, in any order. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of a casualty where the loss does not exceed the
Restoration Threshold, the Borrowers may settle and adjust such claim; provided
that (a) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (b) such
adjustment is carried out in a commercially reasonable and timely manner.

         (C)      Lender shall not exercise Lender's option to apply insurance
proceeds to payment of the Obligations if all of the following conditions are
met: (i) no Event of Default then exists; (ii) Lender reasonably determines that
there will be sufficient funds to complete the Restoration of the Property to at
least substantially the Pre-Existing Condition and to timely make all payments
due under the Loan Documents during the Restoration of the affected Property;
(iii) Lender reasonably determines that the Net Operating Income of the
Properties (including rental income or business interruption insurance) will be
sufficient to pay principal and interest on the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan and
Operating Revenues of the Properties, after the Restoration thereof to the
Pre-Existing Condition, will be sufficient to meet all Operating Expenses,
payments for Reserves and payments of principal and interest under the Note and
the Mezzanine Loan; (iv) Lender determines that the Restoration of the affected
Property to the Pre-Existing Condition will be completed not later than five (5)
months prior to the expiration of any business interruption insurance, but in no
event later than six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date; (v) less than fifty
percent (50%) of the total floor area of the Improvements has been damaged,
destroyed or rendered unusable as a result of such fire or other casualty; and
(vi) such Property can be restored and repaired substantially to the condition
it was in immediately prior to such casualty and in compliance with all
applicable zoning, building and other laws and codes (the "PRE-EXISTING
CONDITION"). If Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to payment of the
Obligations, such application shall be made on the Payment Date immediately
following such election in accordance with the terms of the Cash Management
Agreement.

         (D)      If Lender elects or is obligated to make the insurance
proceeds available for the Restoration of any Property and Lender is holding
such proceeds, the Borrowers agree that, if at any time during the Restoration,
the cost of completing such Restoration, as reasonably determined by Lender,
exceeds the undisbursed insurance proceeds, the Borrowers shall, within ten (10)
Business Days following the written demand by Lender, deposit the amount of such
excess with Lender, and Lender shall first disburse such deposit to pay for the
costs of such Restoration on the same terms and conditions as the insurance
proceeds are disbursed. If the Borrowers deposit such excess with Lender and if,
after completion of the Restoration, any funds remain from the combination of
insurance proceeds and the funds so deposited with Lender by the Borrowers, and
if no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then Lender shall
promptly disburse to the Borrowers such remaining funds.

         (E)      Lender may, at Lender's option, condition disbursement of any
insurance proceeds on Lender's approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld) of plans and specifications of an independent architect
licensed in the state where the Property is located and reasonably satisfactory
to Lender (the "ARCHITECT"), any and all contractors, subcontractors and
materialmen engaged in the Restoration and the contracts under which they have
been engaged, contractor's cost estimates, architect's certificates, waivers of
liens, sworn statements of mechanics and materialmen and such other evidence of
costs, percentage completion of

                                       60

<PAGE>

construction, application of payments, and satisfaction of liens as Lender may
reasonably require. Lender shall not be obligated to disburse insurance proceeds
more frequently than once every calendar month. If insurance proceeds are
applied to the payment of the Obligations and provided no Event of Default
exists, any such application of proceeds to principal shall be without any
Prepayment Consideration and shall not extend or postpone the due dates of the
monthly payments due under the Note or otherwise under the Loan Documents, or
change the amounts of such payments. If Lender elects to apply all of such
insurance proceeds toward the repayment of the Obligations, the Borrowers shall
(subject to compliance with clauses (A), (B), (D) and (F) of Section 11.4) be
entitled to obtain from Lender a Property Release (without representation or
warranty) of the applicable Property from the Lien of the Deed of Trust relating
to such Property (in which event the Borrowers shall not be obligated to restore
the applicable Property pursuant to Section 5.5(B) above) provided that the
Borrowers pay to Lender the amount, if any, by which the Release Price for such
Property exceeds the insurance proceeds received by Lender and applied to
repayment of the Obligations. If any proceeds are applied to reduce the
Obligations under this Section 5.5, provided that no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, no Prepayment Consideration shall be due and payable
in connection with such application. Any amount of insurance proceeds remaining
in Lender's possession after full and final payment and discharge of all
Obligations shall be refunded to, or as directed by, the Borrowers or otherwise
paid in accordance with applicable law. If the Property is sold at foreclosure
or if Lender acquires title to the Property, Lender shall have all of the right,
title and interest of the applicable Borrower in and to any insurance policies
and unearned premiums thereon and in and to the proceeds resulting from any
damage to such Property prior to such sale or acquisition.

         (F)      In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of
insurance proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred
from time to time for work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by
the Architect, less a retainage equal to the lesser of (x) the actual retainage
required pursuant to the permitted contract, or (y) ten percent (10%) of such
costs incurred until the Restoration has been completed. The retainage shall in
no event be less than the amount actually held back by the Borrowers from
contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
retainage shall not be released until the Architect certifies to Lender, or, if
no Architect has been retained by Lender, Lender is reasonably satisfied, that
the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 5.5 and that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the
Property have been obtained from all appropriate governmental authorities, and
Lender receives final lien waivers and such other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid in full
or will be paid in full out of the retainage.

SECTION 5.6 INSPECTION. Each Borrower shall permit any authorized
representatives designated by Lender to visit and inspect during normal business
hours its Property and its business, including its financial and accounting
records, and to make copies and take extracts therefrom and to discuss its
affairs, finances and business with its officers and independent public
accountants (with such Borrower's representative(s) present), at such reasonable
times during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably requested.
Unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall provide
advance written notice of at least three (3) Business Days prior to visiting or
inspecting any Property or such Borrower's offices.

                                       61

<PAGE>

SECTION 5.7 O&M PLAN. Each Borrower that is the owner of a Property set forth on
SCHEDULE 5.7 shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Lender an operations
and maintenance program (the "O&M PLANS") with respect to suspected asbestos,
asbestos-containing materials, and/or mold located in its Property as set forth
in the applicable Environmental Reports. Each Borrower shall at all times
implement and carry out the O&M Plan in accordance with its terms. Lender's
requirement that the Borrowers develop and comply with the O&M Plan shall not be
deemed to constitute a waiver or modification of any covenants or agreements of
the Borrowers or Guarantor with respect to Hazardous Material or Environmental
Laws as set forth in the Environmental Indemnity.

SECTION 5.8 INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

SECTION 5.9 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. The Borrowers will
(A) comply with the requirements of all present and future applicable laws,
rules, regulations and orders of any governmental authority in all jurisdictions
in which it is now doing business or may hereafter be doing business, other than
those laws, rules, regulations and orders the noncompliance with which would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) maintain all licenses and permits now held or
hereafter acquired by any Borrower, the loss, suspension, or revocation of
which, or failure to renew, could have a Material Adverse Effect and (C)
perform, observe, comply and fulfill all of its material obligations, covenants
and conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation.

SECTION 5.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The Borrowers shall, from time to time, execute
and/or deliver such documents, instruments, agreements, financing statements,
and perform such acts as Lender at any time may reasonably request to evidence,
preserve and/or protect the Collateral at any time securing or intended to
secure the Obligations and/or to better and more effectively carry out the
purposes of this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 5.11 PERFORMANCE OF AGREEMENTS AND LEASES. Each Primary Borrower Party
shall duly and punctually perform, observe and comply in all material respects
with all of the terms, provisions, conditions, covenants and agreements on its
part to be performed, observed and complied with (i) hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents to which it is a party, (ii) under all Material Agreements
and Leases and (iii) all other agreements entered into or assumed by such Person
in connection with the Properties, and will not suffer or permit any material
default or event of default (giving effect to any applicable notice requirements
and cure periods) to exist under any of the foregoing except where the failure
to perform, observe or comply with any agreement referred to in this clause
(iii) would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 5.12 LEASES. (A) Without the prior written consent of Lender, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Borrowers shall not, nor
shall the Borrowers authorize Manager or any other Person to, (i) enter into any
Material Lease, (ii) cancel or terminate any Material Lease (except to enforce
any such Lease after a default thereunder); (iii) amend or modify and Material
Lease (except for minor modifications and amendments entered into in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with prudent property management
practices, not materially and adversely affecting the economic terms of the
Material Lease); (iv) approve any assignment, sublease or underlease of any
Material Lease (except as required pursuant to the

                                       62

<PAGE>

express terms of any existing Lease or Lease hereafter approved by Lender); or
(v) cancel or modify any guaranty, or release any security deposit, letter of
credit, or other item constituting security pertaining to any Material Lease
(except as required pursuant to the express terms of any existing Lease or Lease
hereafter approved by Lender).

         (B)      Any request for approval of any Material Lease or assignment,
termination, amendment or modification of any Material Lease shall be made to
Lender in writing and together with such request the Borrowers shall furnish to
Lender: (i) such biographical and financial information about the proposed
tenant as Lender may reasonably require in conjunction with its review, (ii) a
copy of the proposed form of Lease (or amendment or modification), and (iii) a
summary of the material terms of such proposed Lease (or amendment or
modification) including, without limitation, rental terms and the term of the
proposed Lease and any options. Lender's approval of any Material Lease or
assignment, termination, amendment or modification of any Material Lease, shall
be deemed given, if the first correspondence from the Borrowers to Lender
requesting such approval is in an envelope marked "PRIORITY" and contains a
bold-faced, conspicuous legend at the top of the first page thereof stating that
"IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR TO EXPRESSLY DENY THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN
WRITING WITHIN FIFTEEN (15) DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL MAY BE DEEMED GIVEN", and is
accompanied by the information and documents required above and any other
information reasonably requested by Lender in writing prior to the expiration of
such fifteen (15) day period in order to adequately review the same has been
delivered and, if Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny such request for
approval in writing within the fifteen (15) day period, a second notice is
delivered to Lender from the Borrowers in an envelope marked "PRIORITY"
requesting approval containing a bold-faced, conspicuous legend at the top of
the first page thereof stating that "IF YOU FAIL TO RESPOND TO OR EXPRESSLY DENY
THIS REQUEST FOR APPROVAL IN WRITING WITHIN TEN (10) DAYS, YOUR APPROVAL SHALL
BE DEEMED GIVEN" and Lender fails to respond or to expressly deny each request
for approval within the ten (10) day period.

Except for security deposits, no Material Lease executed after the Closing Date
shall provide for payment of rent more than one month in advance, and the
Borrowers shall not under any circumstances collect any such rent more than one
month in advance. The Borrowers, at Lender's request, shall furnish Lender with
executed copies of all Material Leases hereafter made. Each new Material Lease
or a separate agreement with the tenant of such Material Lease shall be in
recordable form and shall specifically provide that such Material Lease (i) is
subordinate to the Deeds of Trust; (ii) that the tenant attorns to Lender, such
attornment to be effective upon Lender's acquisition of title to the Property;
(iii) that the tenant agrees to execute such further evidences of attornment as
Lender may from time to time request; (iv) that the attornment of the tenant
shall not be terminated by foreclosure; (v) that in no event shall Lender, as
holder of the Deeds of Trust or as successor landlord, be liable to the tenant
for any act or omission of any prior landlord or for any liability or obligation
of any prior landlord occurring prior to the date that Lender or any subsequent
owner acquire title to the Property; and (vi) that Lender may, at Lender's
option, accept or reject such attornment.

SECTION 5.13 MANAGEMENT; FRANCHISE AGREEMENT.

         (A)      The Borrowers shall cause each Manager to manage the
Properties in accordance with the Management Agreements including, without
limitation, maintaining inventory in amounts and type customary for hotels
comparable to each Property. The Borrowers shall (i) perform and observe all of
the material terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement on the
part of each Borrower to be performed and observed, and (ii) promptly notify
Lender of any notice to any of the Borrowers of any material default under the
Management Agreement of which it is aware. If any of the Borrowers shall default
in the performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of
the applicable Management Agreement on the part of the Borrowers to be performed
or observed, then, without limiting Lender's other rights or remedies under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, and without waiving or releasing the
Borrowers from any of their obligations hereunder or under the applicable
Management Agreement, Lender shall have the right, upon prior written notice to
the Borrower, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform
any act as may be reasonably appropriate to cause such material conditions of
the applicable Management Agreement on the part of the Borrowers to be performed
or observed.

         (B)      The Borrowers shall not surrender, terminate, cancel, modify
(other than non-material changes), renew or extend the Management Agreement, or
enter into any other Management Agreement with Manager or any new Manager (other
than an Acceptable Manager), or consent to the assignment by the Manager of its
interest under the Management Agreement, in each case without (i) prior to a
Securitization, the express consent of Lender, which consent shall not be

         (A)      NO MODIFICATION. The Borrowers shall not modify or amend any
material or economic terms of, or terminate or surrender any Ground Lease, in

withheld by Lender in its sole and absolute

                                       69

<PAGE>

discretion. Any attempted or purported material modification, amendment, or any

Borrowers shall provide such documents and information as Lender shall
reasonably request concerning the Ground Lease Default.

         (D)      LENDER'S RIGHT TO CURE. If any Ground Lease Default shall
occur and be continuing, or if any Ground Lessor asserts that a Ground Lease
Default has occurred (whether or not the Borrowers question or deny such
assertion), then, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Ground
Lease, Lender, upon five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Borrowers, unless Lender reasonably determines that a shorter period (or no
period) of notice is necessary to protect Lender's interest in the Ground Lease,
may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action that Lender deems reasonably
necessary, including, without limitation, (i) performance or attempted
performance of the applicable Borrower's obligations under the applicable Ground
Lease, (ii) curing or attempting to cure any actual or purported Ground Lease
Default, (iii) mitigating or attempting to mitigate any damages or consequences
of the same and (iv) entry upon the applicable Ground Leased Property for any or
all of such purposes. Upon Lender's request, each Borrower shall submit
satisfactory evidence of payment or performance of any of its obligations under
each Ground Lease. Lender may pay and expend such sums of money as Lender in its
sole discretion deems necessary or desirable for any such purpose, and the
Borrowers shall pay to Lender within five (5) Business Days of the written
demand of Lender all such sums so paid or expended by Lender, together with
interest thereon from the date of expenditure at the Default Rate.

         (E)      LEGAL ACTION. The Borrowers shall not commence any action or
proceeding against any Ground Lessor or affecting or potentially affecting any
Ground Lease or the Borrowers' or Lender's interest therein, the effect of which
could cause an event of default or termination of any such Ground Lease, without
the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Borrowers shall notify Lender immediately
if any action or proceeding shall be commenced between any Ground Lessor and
either Borrower, or affecting or potentially affecting any Ground Lease or
either Borrower's or Lender's interest therein (including, without limitation,
any case commenced by

                                       70

<PAGE>

or against any Ground Lessor under the Bankruptcy Code). Lender shall have the
option, exercisable upon notice from Lender to the Borrowers, to participate in
any such action or proceeding with counsel of Lender's choice. The Borrowers
shall cooperate with Lender, comply with the reasonable instructions of Lender,
execute any and all powers, authorizations, consents or other documents
reasonably required by Lender in connection therewith, and shall not settle any
such action or proceeding without the prior written consent of Lender, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

         (F)      ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE. Subject to the terms and conditions of
the applicable Ground Lease, the Borrowers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain and deliver to Lender within the time period required under
the applicable Ground Lease, an estoppel certificate from each Ground Lessor
setting forth (A)(i) the identities of the original lessor and lessee under the
applicable Ground Lease and each of their respective successors, (ii) that the
Ground Lease has not been modified or, if it has been modified, the date of each
modification (together with copies of each such modification), (iii) the rent
payable under the Ground Lease, (iv) the dates to which all rent and other
charges have been paid, (v) whether there are any alleged Ground Lease Defaults
and, if so, setting forth the nature thereof in reasonable detail, and (vi) such
other matters as Lender may reasonably request or (B) the matters required to be
certified by the Ground Lessor under the applicable Ground Lease. The Borrowers
shall not be required to request an estoppel from any Ground Lessor more than
two (2) times in any calendar year.

         (G)      BANKRUPTCY.

                  (i)      If any Ground Lessor shall reject any Ground Lease
under or pursuant to Section 365 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Borrowers shall not elect to treat the Ground Lease as terminated but shall
elect to remain in possession of the applicable Ground Leased Property and the
leasehold estate under such Ground Lease. The lien of the Deed of Trust covering
such Property does and shall encumber and attach to all of the Borrowers' rights
and remedies at any time arising under or pursuant to Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, including without limitation, all of such Borrower's rights to
remain in possession of such Property and the leasehold estate.

                  (ii)     The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that in any case
commenced by or against the Borrowers under the Bankruptcy Code, Lender by
reason of the liens and rights granted under the Deed of Trust covering such
Property and the Loan Documents shall have a substantial and material interest
in the treatment and preservation of such Borrower's rights and obligations
under such Ground Lease, and that such Borrower shall, in any such bankruptcy
case, provide to Lender immediate and continuous reasonably adequate protection
of such interests. Each Borrower and Lender agree that such adequate protection
shall include but shall not necessarily be limited to the following:

                           (a)      Lender shall be deemed a party to the Ground
Lease (but shall not have any obligations thereunder) for purposes of Section
365 of the Bankruptcy Code, and shall, provided that, prior to an Event of
Default, no such action by Lender would adversely and materially affect the
Borrowers' ability to prosecute, or defend, any such claims asserted therein,

                                       71

<PAGE>

have standing to appear and act as a party in interest in relation to any matter
arising out of or related to the Ground Lease or such Property.

                           (b)      The Borrowers shall serve Lender with copies
of all notices, pleadings and other documents relating to or affecting the
Ground Lease or the applicable Property. Any notice, pleading or document served
by the Borrowers on any other party in the bankruptcy case shall be
contemporaneously served by such Borrower on Lender, and any notice, pleading or
document served upon or received by such Borrower from any other party in the
bankruptcy case shall be served by such Borrower on Lender promptly upon receipt
by such Borrower.

                           (c)      Upon written request of Lender, the
Borrowers shall assume the Ground Lease, and shall take such steps as are
necessary to preserve such Borrower's right to assume the Ground Lease,
including without limitation using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
extensions of time to assume or reject the Ground Lease under Subsection 365(d)
of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent it is applicable.

         (H)      If the Borrowers or the applicable Ground Lessor seeks to
reject any Ground Lease or have the Ground Lease deemed rejected, then prior to
the hearing on such rejection Lender shall, subject to applicable law, be given
no less than twenty (20) days' notice and opportunity to elect in lieu of
rejection to have the Ground Lease assumed and assigned to a nominee of Lender.
If Lender shall so elect to assume and assign the Ground Lease, then the
Borrowers shall, subject to applicable law, continue any request to reject the
Ground Lease until after the motion to assume and assign has been heard. If
Lender shall not elect to assume and assign the Ground Lease, then Lender may,
subject to applicable law, obtain in connection with the rejection of the Ground
Lease a determination that the applicable Ground Lessor, at Lender's option,
shall (1) agree to terminate the Ground Lease and enter into a new lease with
Lender on the same terms and conditions as the Ground Lease, for the remaining
term of the Ground Lease, or (2) treat the Ground Lease as breached and provide
Lender with the rights to cure defaults under the Ground Lease and to assume the
rights and benefits of the Ground Lease.

                  Each Borrower shall join with and support any request by
Lender to grant and approve the foregoing as necessary for adequate protection
of Lender's interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lender may seek additional
terms and conditions, including such economic and monetary protections as it
deems reasonably appropriate to adequately protect its interests, and any
request for such additional terms or conditions shall not delay or limit
Lender's right to receive the specific elements of adequate protection set forth
herein.

                  Each Borrower hereby appoints Lender as its attorney in fact
to act on behalf of Lender in connection with all matters relating to or arising
out of the assumption or rejection of any Ground Lease, in which the other party
to the lease is a debtor in a case under the Bankruptcy Code. This grant of
power of attorney is present, unconditional, irrevocable, durable and coupled
with an interest.

         (A)      NO MODIFICATION. The Condominium Borrowers shall not modify or

Property Documents, in each case, without the prior written consent of Lender,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

         (B)      PERFORMANCE OF MORTGAGED CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY DOCUMENTS. The

obligations. The Condominium Borrowers shall keep and maintain each of the
Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents in full force and effect.

         (C)      NOTICE OF DEFAULT. If the Condominium Borrowers shall receive
any written notice of any Condominium Default, the Condominium Borrowers
immediately shall notify Lender of same and deliver to Lender a true and
complete copy of each such notice, and provide such documents and information as
Lender may reasonably request concerning such Condominium Default.

         (D)      LENDER'S RIGHT TO CURE. If any Condominium Default shall occur
and be continuing, or if any party to any Mortgaged Condominium Property
Document asserts that a Condominium Default has occurred (whether or not the
Borrowers question or deny such assertion), then, subject to the terms and
conditions of the applicable Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents, after
notice to Condominium Borrower, Lender upon five (5) Business Days' prior
written notice to the Borrowers, unless Lender reasonably determines that a
shorter period (or no period) of notice is necessary to protect Lender's
interest in the Ground Lease, may (but shall not be obligated to) take any
action that Lender deems reasonably necessary to cure such Condominium Default,
including, without limitation, (i) performance or attempted performance of the
Borrowers' obligations under the applicable Mortgaged Condominium Property
Documents, (ii) curing or attempting to cure any actual or purported Condominium
Default, (iii) mitigating or attempting to mitigate any damages or consequences
of the same and (iv) entry upon the Mortgaged Condominium Property for any or
all of such purposes. Upon Lender's request, the Condominium Borrowers shall

desirable for any such purpose, and the Borrowers shall pay to Lender within
five (5) Business Days of the written demand of Lender all such sums so paid or
expended by Lender pursuant to this Section 5.26, together with interest thereon
from the date of expenditure at the Default Rate.

         (E)      PRESERVATION OF CONDOMINIUM. The Condominium Borrowers will do
all things necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its material rights,
powers and privileges under the Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents and to
prevent the termination or expiration of the Mortgaged Condominium Property
Documents, or the withdrawal of the Mortgaged

                                       73

<PAGE>

Condominium Property from a condominium form of ownership under applicable law,
to the end that the Condominium Borrowers may enjoy all of the material rights
granted to it as a party to the Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents.

         (F)      NOTICE OF CONDOMINIUM DEFAULTS. The Condominium Borrowers will
(i) promptly notify Lender of the receipt by the Condominium Borrowers of any
notice from the Board of Managers, or the owner of any other unit in the
condominium, covering the Mortgaged Condominium Property, asserting or claiming
a default by the Condominium Borrowers thereunder or lack of compliance by the
Condominium Borrowers with the Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents, (ii)
promptly notify Lender of the receipt by the Condominium Borrowers of any notice

the Board of Managers or owner of any unit of the material modification or
change or proposed material modification or change of the Mortgaged Condominium
Property Documents and (iv) promptly cause a copy of each such notice of request
received by the Condominium Borrowers from the Board of Managers or any unit
owner, or from a mortgagee of a mortgage on such other unit, to be delivered to
Lender. The Condominium Borrowers will permit Lender to participate in any such
partition or withdrawal proceeding to the extent permitted by law and the
Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents (but Lender shall not be obligated so
to do). The Condominium Borrowers will promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each
notice, pleading, brief and preliminary, interim and final determination or
decision and other papers received by it in each such partition or withdrawal
proceeding.

         (G)      INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         (H)      STATEMENTS, NOTICES. The Condominium Borrowers will, within
twenty (20) days after demand from Lender (which shall not be required more than
two (2) times in any calendar year), obtain, if and to the extent that the
Condominium Borrowers is entitled to the same under the Mortgaged Condominium
Property Documents, and otherwise request from and make good faith efforts to
obtain, from the Board of Managers and deliver to Lender a duly signed and
acknowledged certificate (signed also by Condominium Borrower) that the
Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents are unmodified and in full force and
effect (or, if the same have been modified in compliance with this Loan
Agreement, that the Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents are in full force
and effect as to modified and that there have been no other modifications),
stating the dates to which the assessments, common charges and other charges
payable under the Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents have been paid and
stating whether to the certifying party's and Condominium Borrower's knowledge

upon receipt thereof by Condominium Borrower, furnish Lender with a copy of all
notices and statements, however characterized, issued by the Board of Managers
or relating to the Mortgaged Condominium Property Documents including without
limitation, financial statements and projected budgets.

commence the Required Capital Improvements promptly following the Closing and

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                    RESERVES

SECTION 6.1 SECURITY INTEREST IN RESERVES; OTHER MATTERS PERTAINING TO RESERVES.

         (A)      The Borrowers hereby pledge, assign and grant to Lender a
security interest in and to all of the Borrowers' right, title and interest in
and to the Account Collateral, including the Reserves, as security for payment
and performance of all of the Obligations hereunder and under the Note and the
other Loan Documents. The Reserves constitute Account Collateral and are subject
to the security interest in favor of Lender created herein and all provisions of
this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents pertaining to Account
Collateral.

         (B)      In addition to the rights and remedies provided in Article VII
and elsewhere herein, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, Lender shall have all rights and remedies pertaining to the
Reserves as are provided for in any of the Loan Documents or under any
applicable law. Without limiting the foregoing, upon and at all times after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender in its sole
and absolute discretion, may use the Reserves (or any portion thereof) for any
purpose, including but not limited to any combination of the following: (i)
payment of any of the Obligations including

                                       75

<PAGE>

the Prepayment Consideration (if any) applicable upon such payment in such order
as Lender may determine in its sole discretion; provided, however, that such
application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any default; (ii)
reimbursement of Lender for any actual losses or expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred as a result of such
Event of Default; (iii) payment for the work or obligation for which such
Reserves were reserved or were required to be reserved; and (iv) application of
the Reserves in connection with the exercise of any and all rights and remedies
available to Lender at law or in equity or under this Loan Agreement or pursuant
to any of the other Loan Documents. Nothing contained in this Loan Agreement
shall obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the funds contained in the
Reserves during the continuance of an Event of Default to payment of the Loan or
in any specific order of priority.

SECTION 6.2 FUNDS DEPOSITED WITH LENDER.

         (A)      INTEREST, OFFSETS. Except only as expressly provided otherwise
herein, all funds of the Borrowers which are deposited with Lock Box Account
Bank as Reserves hereunder shall be held by Lock Box Account Bank in one or more
Permitted Investments, such Permitted Investments, prior to an Event of Default,
to be as directed by Borrower. All interest which accrues on the Reserves shall
be taxable to the Borrowers and shall be added to and disbursed in the same
manner and under the same conditions as the principal sum on which said interest
accrued. Additional provisions pertaining to investments are set forth in
Article VII. After repayment of all of the Obligations, all funds held as
Reserves will be promptly returned to, or as directed by, the Borrowers.

         (B)      FUNDING AT CLOSING. The Borrowers shall deposit with Lender
the amounts necessary to fund each of the Reserves as set forth below. Deposits
into the Reserves at Closing may occur by deduction from the amount of the Loan
that otherwise would be disbursed to the Borrowers, followed by deposit of the
same into the applicable Sub-Account or Account of the Lock Box Account in
accordance with the Cash Management Agreement on the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding such deductions, the Loan shall be deemed for all purposes to be
fully disbursed at Closing.

SECTION 6.3 IMPOSITIONS AND INSURANCE RESERVE. On the Closing Date, the
Borrowers shall deposit with Lock Box Account Bank $4,225,548.90 and, pursuant
to the Cash Management Agreement, the Borrowers shall deposit monthly, on each
Payment Date commencing on the Payment date in December 2002, 1/12th of the
annual charges (as reasonably estimated by Lender) for all Impositions and all
Insurance Premiums (other than for D&O Insurance) payable with respect to the
Properties hereunder (said funds, together with any interest thereon and
additions thereto, the "IMPOSITIONS AND INSURANCE RESERVE"). The initial amount
of the monthly deposit to be made to the Impositions and Insurance Reserve from
and after the date hereof is $1,100,249. The Borrowers shall also deposit with
Lock Box Account Bank within ten (10) Business Days of the written demand by
Lender, to be added to and included within such reserve, a sum of money which
Lender reasonably estimates, together with such monthly deposits, will be
sufficient to make the payment of each such charge at least ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date initially due. The Borrowers shall provide Lender with
bills and all other documents necessary for the payment of the foregoing charges
at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on which each payment shall first
become subject to penalty or interest if not paid. So

                                       76

<PAGE>

long as (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the
Borrowers have provided Lender with the foregoing bills and other documents in a
timely manner, and (iii) sufficient funds are held by Lender for the payment of
the Impositions and insurance premiums relating to the Property, as applicable,
Lender shall pay said items or disburse to the Borrowers from such Reserve an
amount sufficient to pay said items. Interest shall accrue in favor of the
Borrowers on funds in the Impositions and Insurance Reserve. In addition to (and
not in lieu of) the aforementioned reserves, at Closing, the Borrowers shall
deposit with Lock Box Bank the Supplemental Insurance Reserve Payment to be held
in the Impositions and Insurance Reserve. Lender shall be under no obligation to
cause any portion of the Supplemental Insurance Reserve Payment to be released
to the Borrowers for the payment of any Impositions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, provided no Event of Default has occurred and is then
continuing, Lender shall cause the remainder, if any, of the Supplemental
Insurance Reserve Payment to be disbursed to the Borrowers within five (5)
Business Days of the delivery by the Borrowers to Lender of each of the
Insurance Policies required pursuant to the terms of Section 5.4 hereof
providing coverage for a period of one (1) year, together with evidence of the
payment in full of the annual premiums payable for such Insurance Policies.

SECTION 6.4 FF&E RESERVE. On or prior to the Closing Date, Lender or Servicer on
behalf of Lender shall establish and maintain with the Lock Box Bank an account,
for the purpose of creating a reserve for replacements of the furniture,
fixtures and equipment at or in, or used in connection with, the Property (the
"REPLACEMENTS") in accordance with the applicable CapEx/FF&E Budget approved by
Lender (said funds, together with any interest thereon and additions thereto,
the "FF&E RESERVE") which account shall be an Eligible Account entitled "FF&E
Reserve Account for the benefit of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc., as
secured party" and shall be under the sole dominion and control of Lender,
subject to the terms of the Cash Management Agreement. Pursuant to the Cash
Management Agreement, the Borrowers shall deposit with Lock Box Account Bank
monthly, on each Payment Date commencing with the Payment Date in December 2002,
an amount equal to 4.0% of the Operating Revenues generated from the Properties
for the prior calendar month (such amount, the "MONTHLY FF&E PAYMENT"). Funds
held in the FF&E Reserve may be withdrawn by the Borrowers, subject in all
instances to the terms of the Cash Management Agreement, only in accordance with
the approved CapEx/FF&E Budget, and no funds held in the FF&E Reserve shall be
used in connection with the Required Capital Improvements. Upon and at all times
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no draws
will be permitted from the FF&E Reserve other than for normal repairs,
replacements, maintenance expenses, and otherwise in accordance with the terms
of the Management Agreement, subject, in each instance, to Manager's compliance
with the FF&E reporting requirements set forth in Section 5.1(A)(v)(d).

SECTION 6.5 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE; REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. At
Closing, the Borrowers shall reserve from the proceeds of the Loan and shall
deposit with Lock Box Account Bank $6,953,315.50 (said funds, together with any
interest thereon, the "CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE"), which funds shall be made
available to the Borrowers solely for payment of certain Capital Improvements
required to be made to the Properties and designated as "Required Capital
Improvements" on the Capital Improvement Plan attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the
"REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS") and shall not be used by the Borrowers for
purposes for which any other Reserve is established or for any other purpose
other than completion of the Required Capital Improvements. The Borrowers shall
promptly commence and diligently

                                       77

<PAGE>

prosecute to completion, subject to Force Majeure, the Required Capital
Improvements within the time periods for each Required Capital Improvement set
forth on EXHIBIT A. Funds held in the Capital Improvement Reserve shall be
disbursed in accordance with Section 6.7. Subject to the foregoing conditions,
the Borrowers shall be entitled to draw any remaining balance in the Capital
Improvement Reserve when all Required Capital Improvements are complete, and
paid for, in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 6.6 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION RESERVE. At Closing, the Borrowers
shall reserve from the proceeds of the Loan and shall deposit with Lock Box
Account Bank, an amount equal to $1,039,688.00 (said funds, together with any
interest thereon and additions thereto, the "HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION
RESERVE") for certain work related to Hazardous Materials on the Properties as
indicated in the Environmental Reports for the Properties prepared and delivered
prior to the Closing and as such work is more particularly described on SCHEDULE
6.6 (the "ENVIRONMENTAL WORK"). Prior to the earlier of (x) the date required by
any applicable Governmental Authority or (y) nine (9) months after the Closing,
the Borrowers shall, subject to Force Majeure, complete such Environmental Work
and shall provide to Lender such closure reports, no-further-action letters, or
other evidence of compliance with law as Lender may reasonably require. The
funds contained in the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve shall be utilized
by the Borrowers solely for performance of the Environmental Work in accordance
with the Environmental Reports, and shall not be used by the Borrowers for
purposes for which any other Reserve is established. Subject to the Borrowers'
satisfaction of the applicable conditions of Section 6.7, the Borrowers shall be
entitled to draw upon the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve to pay for
costs that have been incurred by the Borrowers for such Environmental Work,
provided that the Borrowers deliver to Lender such evidence as may be reasonably
satisfactory to Lender that, after payment of such draw, the funds remaining in
the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve shall be sufficient to pay for the
remainder of such Environmental Work. Subject to the foregoing conditions, the
Borrowers shall be entitled to draw any remaining balance in the Hazardous
Materials Remediation Reserve when all such Environmental Work is complete, and
is paid for, in accordance with the terms hereof.

SECTION 6.7 CONDITIONS TO DISBURSEMENTS FROM HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION
RESERVE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE; PERFORMANCE OF WORK.

         (A)      DISBURSEMENTS FROM THE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS REMEDIATION RESERVE
AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT RESERVE. Upon the Borrowers' written request for
disbursement, Lender shall authorize Lock Box Account Bank to disburse funds to
or for the account of the Borrowers (x) from the Hazardous Materials Remediation
Reserve, to pay to, or pay on behalf of, the Borrowers for the amount of the
Borrowers' actual bona fide out-of-pocket expenditures or costs incurred for
Environmental Work (the "APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES", and (y) from the
Capital Improvement Reserve, to pay to, or pay on behalf of, the Borrowers for
the amount of the Borrowers' actual bona fide out-of-pocket expenditures or
costs incurred for Required Capital Improvements ("APPROVED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
EXPENDITURES"; and together with the Approved Environmental Expenditures,
collectively, "APPROVED EXPENDITURES"; and the related Environmental Work or
Required Capital Improvements to which any such request for disbursement relates
shall be referred to as the "WORK"), upon satisfaction of each of the

                                       78

<PAGE>

conditions listed on SCHEDULE 6.7 and each of the conditions set forth below in
Lender's reasonable discretion:

                  (i)      Except as provided in this Section 6.7, each request
for disbursement from the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve or the Capital
Improvement Reserve (such Reserves, the "WORK RESERVES") shall be made for
completion of the Approved Expenditures for which disbursement is requested.

                  (ii)     A request for disbursement from the Work Reserves may
be made after completion of a portion of the work under such contract, provided
(1) all other conditions in this Loan Agreement for disbursement have been
satisfied, (2) funds remaining in the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve
are, in Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to complete the Environmental
Work when required and/or funds remaining in the Capital Improvement Reserve
are, in Lender's reasonable judgment, sufficient to complete such item of
Required Capital Improvements and any other Required Capital Improvements
remaining to be performed, as the case may be, and (3) if reasonably required by
Lender, each contractor or subcontractor receiving payments in excess of
$100,000 under such contract shall provide a waiver of lien with respect to
amounts which have been paid to that contractor or subcontractor.

                  (iii)    To the extent the contract with the relevant
contractor or supplier provides for a retainage, each disbursement from a Work
Reserve, except for a final disbursement, shall be in the amount of actual costs
incurred less the percentage of such costs that the contract with the relevant
contractor or supplier specifies to be retained and advanced as part of the
final disbursement. No funds will be advanced for materials stored at any
Property unless such materials are properly stored and secured at the applicable
Property in accordance with the Borrowers' customary procedures and sound
construction practices as reasonably determined by Lender. No funds will be
advanced for materials stored at any location other than at the Properties
unless Lender determines in its reasonable discretion that Lender has a
perfected first priority security interest in any such materials.

                  (iv)     The amount of all invoices in connection with the
Work with respect to which a disbursement is requested and which has been
approved by Lender shall be disbursed by Lock Box Account Bank as directed by
the Borrowers (in which event, the Borrowers covenant and agree to promptly pay
such invoices) or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, at
Lender's option and in Lender's sole and absolute discretion, directly to the
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor indicated on said
invoices unless already paid by the Borrowers and Lender has received
satisfactory evidence of such payment in which case Lender shall reimburse the
Borrowers. If the Borrowers request that any amounts be disbursed directly to
the Borrowers pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the Borrowers shall be
required to deliver evidence reasonably acceptable to Lender of payment of all
invoices for which disbursements were previously made to the Borrowers as a
condition to such requested disbursement.

                  (v)      No more than two (2) disbursements will be made by
Lender from the Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve or the Capital
Improvement Reserve in any calendar month, and, if made in accordance herewith
or otherwise approved by Lender, requested disbursements will be made within
five (5) Business Days after the request therefor. Lender

                                       79

<PAGE>

shall not be required to make any disbursement from a Work Reserve with respect
to the Property unless such requested disbursement is in an amount equal to or
greater than $25,000 (other than the final disbursement).

                  (vi)     Lender reserves the right, at its option and as a
condition to any disbursement from a Work Reserve, to approve (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) (i) all drawings and plans and
specifications, if any, for any Work which require aggregate payments in amounts
exceeding the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan
Amount with respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000, and (ii) all
contracts and work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers,
subcontractors, contractors and other parties providing labor or materials in
connection with any Work which require aggregate payments in amounts exceeding
the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount with
respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000. Upon Lender's reasonable
request, the Borrowers shall assign (to the extent assignable) any drawings,
plans and specifications, contracts or subcontracts to Lender. Drawings, plans
and specifications, contracts and work orders approved by Lender shall not be
changed in any material respect without Lender's prior written consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

                  (vii)    The Borrowers shall have delivered a certificate to
Lender from an Architect certifying that the Work has been completed in a good
and workmanlike manner in accordance with all applicable laws for any item in
excess of the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the Aggregate Allocate Loan
Amount with respect to the applicable Property or (y) $250,000. Lender may
retain its own architect or engineer ("LENDER'S CONSULTANT") to review any plans
and specifications for any items in excess of the greater of (x) five percent
(5%) of the Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount with respect to the applicable
Property or (y) $250,000, and to periodically inspect any Work at the Borrowers'
sole cost and expense.

                  (viii)   The Borrowers shall have delivered to Lender a
certificate of the Borrowers certifying as to the actual costs which were
incurred by the Borrowers to complete such Work, which costs shall not
materially exceed the amount budgeted for such Work under the Capital
Improvement Plan then in effect unless approved by Lender, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (together with supporting
documentation reasonably acceptable to Lender).

                  (ix)     The Borrowers shall have delivered to Lender all
necessary material certificates, authorizations, permits and licenses which are
required to permit the construction and completion of the Work, as issued by the
appropriate Governmental Authority. The Borrowers, to the full extent permitted
by applicable law, hereby assigns to Lender as additional security for the
payment of the Obligations and the observance and performance by the Borrowers
of the terms, covenants and provisions of the Loan Documents all right, title
and interest which the Borrowers may now have or may hereafter acquire in and to
such certificates, authorizations, permits and licenses.

                  (x)      Lender may require an inspection of the Property
prior to making a monthly disbursement from the applicable Work Reserve in order
to verify completion of the Work for which disbursement is sought in excess of
the greater of (x) five percent (5%) of the

                                       80

<PAGE>

Aggregate Allocated Loan Amount with respect to the applicable Property or (y)
$250,000. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by Lender's
Consultant and/or may require a copy of a certificate of completion by an
independent qualified architect or engineer acceptable to Lender prior to the
disbursement of any amounts from the applicable Work Reserve. The Borrowers
shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expense of such inspections as reasonably
required hereunder, whether such inspections are conducted by Lender, Servicer,
Lender's Consultant or by an independent qualified professional.

         (B)      PERFORMANCE OF WORK.

                  (i)      The Borrowers shall complete all Work in a good and
workmanlike manner as soon as practicable following the commencement thereof
substantially in accordance with the applicable budget approved by Lender in
accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement. The insufficiency of the
balance in the applicable Work Reserve shall not relieve the Borrowers from
their obligations to perform and complete the related Work as herein provided or
to fulfill all other preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan
Documents.

                  (ii)     If Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that any Work is not being performed in a workmanlike or timely manner or that
any Work has not been completed in a workmanlike manner, Lender shall have the
option to withhold disbursement for such unsatisfactory work and so notify the
Borrowers with reasonable detail regarding the basis for Lender's
dissatisfaction and, after the expiration of forty-five (45) days from the
giving of such notice by Lender to the Borrowers of such unsatisfactory work
without the cure thereof (or, if such unsatisfactory work is susceptible of a
cure but cannot reasonably be cured within said forty-five (45) day period and
provided that the Borrowers shall have commenced to cure such unsatisfactory
work within said forty-five (45) day period and thereafter diligently and
expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, after the expiration of such longer
period as is reasonably necessary for the Borrowers in the exercise of due
diligence to cure such unsatisfactory work, up to a maximum of an additional
sixty (60) days, subject to Force Majeure, without the cure thereof). Lender may
proceed under existing contracts or contract with third parties to complete such
Work, as the case may be, and apply amounts contained in the applicable Work
Reserve toward the labor and materials necessary to complete the same, without
providing any additional prior notice to the Borrowers, and exercise any and all
other remedies available to Lender upon and during the continuance of an Event
of Default hereunder.

                  (iii)    In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making
of any Work pursuant to Section 6.7(B)(ii) above, the Borrowers grant Lender the
right to enter onto each Property during normal business hours after the
expiration of the notice specified above and perform, subject to the rights of
tenants, any and all work and labor necessary to complete the applicable Work
and/or employ watchmen to protect the Property from damage. All sums so expended
by Lender shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to the Borrowers
and secured by the applicable Deed of Trust. For this purpose, the Borrowers
constitute and appoint Lender their true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full
power of substitution to complete or undertake the applicable Work in the name
of the Borrowers pursuant to Section 6.7(B)(ii) above. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Borrowers empower said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any funds in the
applicable Work Reserve for the purpose

                                       81

<PAGE>

of making or completing any Work; (ii) to make such additions, changes and
corrections to any Work as shall be reasonably necessary or desirable to
complete the same; (iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
architects and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (iv) to pay,
settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may become Liens
against any Property, or as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of
any Work, or for clearance of title; (v) to execute all applications and
certificates in the name of the Borrowers which may be required by any of the
contract documents; (vi) in its reasonable discretion, to prosecute and defend
all actions or proceedings in connection with any Property or the rehabilitation
and repair of such Property; and (vii) to do any and every act which the
Borrowers might do in their own behalf to fulfill the terms of this Loan
Agreement.

                  (iv)     Nothing in this Section shall: (i) make Lender
responsible for making or completing any Work; (ii) require Lender to expend
funds in addition to the amounts on deposit in the applicable Work Reserve to
make or complete any Work; (iii) obligate Lender to proceed with any Work; or
(iv) obligate Lender to demand from the Borrowers additional sums to make or
complete any Work.

                  (v)      The Borrowers shall permit Lender and Lender's agents
and representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect
or inspector) or third parties performing any Work pursuant to this Section 6.7
to enter onto any Property during normal business hours upon reasonable notice
(subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of
any Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all
plans and shop drawings relating thereto which are or may be kept at any
Property, and to complete any Work made pursuant to Section 6.7(B)(ii). The
Borrowers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all contractors and
subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or Lender's representatives or such
other persons described above in connections with inspections described in this
Section 6.7(B) or the completion of the Work pursuant to this Section 6.7(B).

                  (vi)     All Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures and
any other item comprising a part thereof shall be constructed, installed or
completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's, materialman's or
other liens (except for the Permitted Encumbrances).

                  (vii)    All Work shall comply with all applicable legal
requirements of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over the
Properties and applicable insurance requirements, including, without limitation,
applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental regulations and
requirements of insurance underwriters.

         (C)      INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrowers shall indemnify Lender and hold
Lender harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands,
liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) arising from or in any way connected with the performance of the
Work, except to the extent caused by the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross
negligence of Lender. The Borrowers shall assign to Lender all rights and claims
the Borrowers may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in
connection with the Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
right or claim or pursue any

                                       82

<PAGE>

other action with respect to such rights and claims unless an Event of Default
has occurred and remains uncured.

SECTION 6.8 CASH TRAP RESERVE. (i) If, at any time prior to the repayment of the
Obligations in full, a Cash Trap Event shall occur, then, from and after the
occurrence of such Cash Trap Event and for so long as such Cash Trap Event
continues to exist, all Excess Cash Flow (except as otherwise expressly provided
below) shall be deposited with Lender (or its Servicer or agent) and held in the
Lock Box Account in accordance with the terms of the Cash Management Agreement
(said funds, together with any interest thereon, the "CASH TRAP RESERVE"). A
"CASH TRAP EVENT" shall occur as of any Calculation Date when (x) the Debt Yield
is less than the Minimum Debt Yield or (y) the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is
less than the Minimum DSCR, in each case for the trailing twelve (12) month
period ending on such Calculation Date and shall continue to exist until such
time as the Minimum Debt Yield and the Minimum DSCR tests have been satisfied
for three (3) consecutive Calculation Dates (on a trailing twelve (12) month
basis) following such Calculation Date. Notwithstanding that the Debt Yield is
less than the Minimum Debt Yield or the Debt Service Coverage Ratio is less than
the Minimum DSCR as of any Calculation Date, no Cash Trap Event shall be deemed
to have occurred as a result of such event if the Borrowers make a principal
prepayment of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance (which prepayment
amount shall be disbursed in accordance with the term of the Cash Management
Agreement) in such amounts, and applied, on the next Payment Date), within three
(3) Business Days after the date of delivery of the financial statements
disclosing the existence of such Cash Trap Event (or the date on which such
financial statements are required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.1), in
an amount equal to the greater of (x) one percent (1%) of the Aggregate
Outstanding Principal Balance, or (y) 120% of the amount, as determined by
Lender in its reasonable discretion, sufficient to cause the Debt Yield to meet
or exceed the Minimum Debt Yield and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio to meet or
exceed the Minimum DSCR if such calculations were recalculated as provided above
assuming that such amount was applied to reduce the Aggregate Outstanding
Principal Balance as of the first day of the relevant measuring period. During
the continuance of a Cash Trap Event, any funds on deposit in the Cash Trap
Reserve may, at the Borrowers' election, be retained in the Cash Trap Reserve or
may be applied to (i) prepayment of the Aggregate Outstanding Principal Balance
as provided above, (ii) Capital Expenditures reasonably approved by Lender, or
(iii) scheduled payments (not to exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate) of
principal and interest under the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan (to be applied in
accordance with the terms of the Cash Management Agreement). Any funds of
deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve shall continue to be held as additional
Collateral in accordance with this Section 6.8 until the earlier of (a) the date
that such funds are applied or disbursed pursuant to the foregoing sentence and
(b) the date the Minimum Debt Yield and the Minimum DSCR tests have each been
satisfied for three (3) consecutive months (as determined above), at which time,
provided no Event of Default exists, such funds shall be released to the
Borrowers. The existence of a Cash Trap Event shall be determined by Lender in
its reasonable good faith determination. If Lender determines that a Cash Trap
Event has occurred, Lender shall send the Borrowers written notice thereof.
Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, all funds on deposit in the Cash Trap Reserve and
any subsequent Excess Cash Flow, while such Event of Default is continuing, may
be applied by Lender to payment of the Loan (including payment of any Prepayment
Consideration) or other Obligations (or to the obligations of the Mezzanine
Borrowers to Mezzanine Lender) as Lender may elect.

SECTION 7.1 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNT AND LOCK BOX ACCOUNT.

         (A)      (i) DEPOSIT ACCOUNT. On or before the Closing Date, one or
more deposit accounts shall be established at the Borrowers' sole cost and
expense in the name of Lender, as secured party hereunder (said accounts, and
any accounts replacing same in accordance with this Loan Agreement and the
Deposit Account Agreement, collectively, the "DEPOSIT ACCOUNT") with one or more
financial institutions reasonably approved by Lender (collectively, the "DEPOSIT
BANK"), pursuant to one or more agreements (collectively, the "DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
AGREEMENT") substantially similar to Lender's form or otherwise in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Lender, executed and delivered by the
Borrowers and the Deposit Bank. The Deposit Account shall be under the sole
dominion and control of Lender (which dominion and control may be exercised by
Servicer). Among other things, the Deposit Account Agreement shall provide that
the Borrowers shall have no access to or control over the Deposit Account, that
all available funds on deposit in the Deposit Account shall be transferred by
wire transfer (or transfer via the ACH System) on each Business Day by the
Deposit Bank into the Lock Box Account, for application in accordance with the
Cash Management Agreement. The Deposit Bank and the Lock Box Account Bank shall
be directed to deliver to the Borrowers copies of bank statements and other
information made available by the Deposit Bank and the Lock Box Account Bank
concerning the Deposit Account and the Lock Box Account.

                  (ii)     Upon establishing the Deposit Account, (1) the
Borrowers shall cause any and all Operating Revenues, including distributions or
other payments made directly or indirectly to the Borrowers, Manager, or any of
their respective Affiliates, from any Beverage Company, but excluding any award
made to the Borrowers with respect to the Pre-Closing Condemnation, to be
deposited promptly into the Deposit Account and in no event later than two (2)
Business Days after the same are paid to or for the benefit of the Borrowers,
and (2) the Borrowers shall each obtain an agreement (each, a "CREDIT CARD
RECEIVABLES PAYMENT DIRECTION LETTER") from each of the Persons paying or
disbursing credit card receivables (the "CREDIT CARD COMPANIES"), substantially
similar to Lender's form or otherwise in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Lender, pursuant to which the Credit Card Companies agree to pay
all credit card receivables into the Lock Box Account, and acknowledge and agree
that Lender shall have a first priority perfected security interest in such
credit card receivables. To the extent that the Borrowers or any Person on the
Borrowers' behalf holds any Receipts, whether in accordance with this Loan
Agreement or otherwise, the Borrowers shall be deemed to hold the same in trust
for Lender for the protection of the interests of Lender hereunder and under the
Loan Documents. The Borrowers represent and warrant that, as of the date hereof,
the only Credit Card Companies paying or disbursing credit card receivables with
respect to the Property are Chase Merchant Services, American Express, Discover
Financial Service, Diners Club, JCB (Japanese Credit Bureau), and, if any of the
Borrowers shall hereafter enter into an agreement with any other Credit Card
Company pursuant to which such Credit Card Company shall pay credit card
receivables with respect to the Properties, such Borrower shall promptly obtain
a Credit Card Receivables Payment Direction Letter in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Lender from such Credit Card Company.

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    The Borrowers shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the transactions and
other matters contemplated by this Section 7.1, including but not limited to,
Lender's reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, and all reasonable fees and
expenses of the Deposit Bank and the Lock Box Account Bank, including without
limitation their reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.

         (B)      LOCK BOX ACCOUNT. On or before the Closing Date, pursuant to
the terms of the Cash Management Agreement, an Eligible Account shall be
established in the name of Lender, as secured party hereunder, to serve as the
"Lock Box Account" (said account, and any account replacing the same in
accordance with this Loan Agreement and the Cash Management Agreement, the "LOCK
BOX ACCOUNT"; and the depositary institution in which the Lock Box Account is
maintained, the "LOCK BOX ACCOUNT BANK"). The Lock Box Account shall be under
the sole dominion and control of Lender (which dominion and control may be
exercised by Servicer); and except as expressly provided hereunder and/or in the
Cash Management Agreement, the Borrowers shall not have the right to control or
direct the investment or payment of funds therein during the continuance of an
Event of Default. Lender may elect to change any financial institution in which
the Lock Box Account shall be maintained if such institution is no longer an
Eligible Bank, upon not less than five (5) Business Days' notice to the
Borrower. The Lock Box Account shall be deemed to contain such sub-accounts as
Lender may designate ("SUB-ACCOUNTS"), which may be maintained as separate
ledger accounts and need not be separate Eligible Accounts. The Sub-Accounts
shall include the following as more particularly described in the Cash
Management Agreement.

                  (i)      "DEBT SERVICE SUB-ACCOUNT" shall mean the Sub-Account
of the Lock Box Account established for the purposes of reserving for payments
of principal and interest and other amounts due under the Loan Documents (but
without duplication of amounts covered under item (ii) below); and

                  (ii)     "RESERVE SUB-ACCOUNTS" shall mean the Sub-Accounts of
the Lock Box Account established for the purpose of holding funds in the
Reserves including: (a) the "Imposition and Insurance Reserve Sub-Account"; (b)
the "Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve Sub-Account"; (c) the
"Extraordinary Receipts Sub-Account" (d) the "Mezzanine Loan Debt Service
Sub-Account"; and (e) the "Cash Trap Reserve Sub-Account".

SECTION 7.2 APPLICATION OF FUNDS IN LOCK BOX ACCOUNT. Funds in the Lock Box
Account shall be allocated to the Sub-Accounts or the other Accounts (or paid,
as the case may be) in accordance with the Cash Management Agreement.

SECTION 7.3 APPLICATION OF FUNDS AFTER EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default
shall occur and be continuing, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section or elsewhere, Lender shall have all rights and remedies available
under applicable law and under the Loan Documents. Without limitation of the
foregoing, for so long as an Event of Default exists, Lender may apply any and
all funds in the Deposit Account, the FF&E Reserve, the Lock Box Account, the
Hazardous Materials Remediation Reserve Sub-Account, the Extraordinary Receipts
Sub-Account, the Cash Trap Reserve Sub-Account and/or any Sub-Accounts against
all or any portion of any of the Obligations, in any order.

5.19, 5.20, Article IX, or Section 11.1 (provided that in the case of an
involuntary Lien under Section 5.18 or 11.1, the same shall not constitute an
Event of Default if within thirty (30) days after the filing thereof, the
Borrowers shall either (i) cause the same to be removed of record, or (ii)
provide to Lender security for the same in an amount and pursuant to terms both
satisfactory to Lender in Lender's sole discretion; provided however that if (x)
the default under Section 5.18 or 11.1 is capable of cure but with diligence

event beyond ninety (90) days after the original notice of default); or

         (E)      BREACH OF WARRANTY. Any representation, warranty,
certification or other statement made by any Borrower, Guarantor or Manager
thereof in any Loan Document or in any statement or certificate at any time
given in writing pursuant to or in connection with any Loan Document is false in
any material respect as of the date made; or

         (F)      OTHER DEFAULTS UNDER LOAN DOCUMENTS. A default shall occur in
the performance of or compliance with any term contained in this Loan Agreement
or the other Loan Documents and such default is not fully cured within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Borrowers of written notice from Lender of such
default (other than occurrences described in other provisions of this Section
8.1 for which a different grace or cure period is specified or which constitute
immediate Events of Default); provided however that if (i) the default is
capable

                                       86

<PAGE>

of cure but with diligence cannot be cured within such period of thirty (30)
days, (ii) the Borrowers (or the applicable Borrower Party) has commenced the
cure within such thirty (30) day period and has pursued such cure diligently,
and (iii) each Borrower delivers to Lender promptly following written demand

Party or over all or a substantial part of its property, is entered, or (z) an
interim receiver, trustee or other custodian is appointed without the consent of
any Borrower Party, for all or a substantial part of the property of such
Person; or

         (H)      VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY; APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER, ETC. (i) An

warrant of attachment, or similar process is entered or filed against any
Borrower Party or any of its assets,, which claim is not fully covered by

agency from conducting all or any material part of their business and such order
continues for more than thirty (30) days; or

         (M)      INVALIDITY OF LOAN DOCUMENTS. This Loan Agreement, any Deed of
Trust or any of the Loan Documents for any reason ceases to be in full force and

Encumbrances (except in any of the foregoing cases in accordance with the terms
hereof or under any other Loan Document) and the Borrowers do not take all
actions requested by Lender to correct such defect within ten (10) days after
the written request by Lender to take such action, or any Person under the
control of the Borrowers or Guarantor who is a party thereto, other than Lender,
denies that it has any further liability (as distinguished from denial of the
existence of a Default or Event of Default) under any Loan Documents to which it
is party, or gives notice to such effect; or

         (N)      CROSS-DEFAULT WITH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. A default beyond any
applicable grace periods shall occur under any of the other Loan Documents; or

         (O)      DEFAULT UNDER MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS OR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.
(i) An Uncured Franchise Default occurs; (ii) or any breach or default shall
occur in the material obligations of the Borrowers under any of the Management
Agreements, and such breach or default either is of such a nature or continues

that Manager shall have the right to exercise material remedies as a consequence
thereof; or

         (P)      GROUND LEASE/MORTGAGED CONDOMINIUM PROPERTY. Any default by
any of the Borrowers beyond any applicable grace period shall occur under any
Ground Lease or any Mortgaged Condominium Property Document or any actual or
attempted surrender, termination, modification or amendment of any Ground Lease
or any Mortgaged Condominium Property Document without Lender's prior written
consent.

                  If more than one of the foregoing paragraphs shall describe
the same condition or event, then Lender shall have the right to select which
paragraph or paragraphs shall apply. In any such case, Lender shall have the
right (but not the obligation) to designate the paragraph or paragraphs which
provide for non-written notice (or for no notice) or for a shorter time to cure
(or for no time to cure).

SECTION 8.2 ACCELERATION AND REMEDIES

         (A)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default described in any of Subsections 8.1(G), 8.1(H), or 8.1(I), the unpaid
principal amount of and accrued interest and fees on the Loan and all other
Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
acceleration or other requirements of any kind, all of which are hereby

                                       88

<PAGE>

expressly waived by the Borrowers. Upon and at any time after the occurrence of
any other Event of Default, at the option of Lender, which may be exercised
without notice or demand to anyone, all or any portion of the Loan and other
Obligations shall immediately become due and payable.

         (B)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, all or any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other
remedies available to Lender against the Borrowers under this Loan Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, or at law or in equity, may be exercised by
Lender at any time and from time to time, whether or not all or any of the
Obligations shall be declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall
have commenced any foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of
its rights and remedies under any of the Loan Documents with respect to the
Properties. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and concurrent
and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together or otherwise,
at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its sole discretion,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, without impairing or otherwise affecting
the other rights and remedies of Lender permitted by law, equity or contract or
as set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, if an Event of Default is continuing (i) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, Lender shall not be subject to any "one action"
or "election of remedies" law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights,
remedies or privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect
until Lender has exhausted all of its remedies against each Property and the
Deeds of Trust have been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Obligations or the Obligations have been paid in full.

         (C)      Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially
foreclose the Deeds of Trust in any manner and for any amounts secured by the
Deeds of Trust then due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole
discretion including, without limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in
the event the Borrowers default beyond any applicable grace period in the
payment of one or more scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may
foreclose the Deed of Trust to recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the
event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire outstanding principal
balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose the Deed of Trust or any of them to
recover so much of the principal balance of the Loan as Lender may accelerate
and such other sums secured by the Deed of Trust as Lender may elect.
Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Property shall remain
subject to the Deed of Trust to secure payment of sums secured by the Deed of
Trust and not previously recovered.

         (D)      During the continuance of an Event of Default, Lender shall
have the right from time to time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents
into one or more separate notes, mortgages and other security documents in such
denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion for purposes of
evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. The
Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Lender from time to time, within ten (10)
days after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents
as Lender shall reasonably request in order to effect the severance described in
the preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Lender. The Borrowers hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoint Lender as their
true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest, in their name and stead to
make and execute all documents reasonably necessary to effect the aforesaid

                                       89

<PAGE>

severance if the Borrowers fail to do so within ten (10) days of Lender's
written request, the Borrowers ratifying all that their said attorney shall do
by virtue thereof.

         (E)      Any amounts recovered from the Properties or any other
collateral for the Loan after an Event of Default may be applied by Lender
toward the payment of any interest and/or principal of the Loan and/or any other
amounts due under the Loan Documents in such order, priority and proportions as
Lender in its sole discretion shall determine.

         (F)      The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Loan
Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy which Lender may have against the Borrowers pursuant to this Loan
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. Lender's rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singly,
concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may
determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any
remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such
remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such
remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be
deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to
the Borrowers shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or
Event of Default by the Borrowers or to impair any remedy, right or power
consequent thereon.

SECTION 8.3 PERFORMANCE BY LENDER.

         (A)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, if any of the Borrowers shall fail to perform, or cause to be
performed, any material covenant, duty or agreement contained in any of the Loan
Documents (subject to applicable notice and cure periods), Lender may perform or
attempt to perform such covenant, duty or agreement on behalf of the Borrowers
including making protective advances on behalf of any Borrower, or, in its sole
discretion, causing the obligations of any of the Borrowers to be satisfied with
the proceeds of any Reserve. In such event, the Borrowers shall, at the request
of Lender, promptly pay to Lender, or reimburse, as applicable, any of the
Reserves, any actual amount reasonably expended or disbursed by Lender in such
performance or attempted performance, together with interest thereon at the
Default Rate (including reimbursement of any applicable Reserves), from the date
of such expenditure or disbursement, until paid. Any amounts advanced or
expended by Lender to perform or attempt to perform any such matter shall be
added to and included within the indebtedness evidenced by the applicable Note
and shall be secured by all of the Collateral securing the applicable Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly agreed that Lender shall not have
any liability or responsibility for the performance of any obligation of the
Borrowers under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, and it is
further expressly agreed that no such performance by Lender shall cure any Event
of Default hereunder.

         (B)      Lender may cease or suspend any and all performance required
of Lender under the Loan Documents upon and at any time after the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default.

SECTION 8.4 EVIDENCE OF COMPLIANCE. Promptly following request by Lender, each
Borrower shall provide such documents and instruments as shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Lender to

                                       90

<PAGE>

evidence compliance with any material provision of the Loan Documents applicable
to the Borrowers.

                                    ARTICLE X
                RESTRUCTURING LOAN, SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS

SECTION 10.1 SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY. Lender shall have the
right to engage in one or more Secondary Market Transactions with respect to the
Loan, and to structure and restructure all or any part of the Loan, including
without limitation in multiple tranches, as a wraparound loan, or for inclusion
in a REMIC or other Securitization. Without limitation, Lender shall have the
right, at Lender's sole cost (other than each Borrower's internal costs and
expenses and the costs and expenses of the Borrowers' counsel), to cause the
Note and any Deed of Trust to be split into a first and a second mortgage loan,
or into one or more loans evidenced by multiple notes and secured by multiple
deeds of trust and/or by ownership interests in any of

                                       94

<PAGE>

the Borrowers in whatever proportion Lender determines, and thereafter to engage
in Secondary Market Transactions with respect to all or any part of the
indebtedness and loan documentation. Each of the Borrower Parties acknowledge
that it is the intention of the parties that all or a portion of the Loan will
be securitized and that all or a portion of the Loan will be rated by one or
more Rating Agencies. Each of the Borrower Parties further acknowledge that
additional structural modifications may be required to satisfy issues raised by
any Rating Agencies. As used herein, "SECONDARY MARKET TRANSACTION" means any of
(i) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of all or any portion of the
Obligations or the Loan Documents or any interest therein to one or more
investors, (ii) the sale, assignment, or other transfer of one or more
participation interests in the Obligations or Loan Documents to one or more
investors, (iii) the transfer or deposit of all or any portion of the
Obligations or Loan Documents to or with one or more trusts or other entities
which may sell certificates or other instruments to investors evidencing an
ownership interest in the assets of such trust or the right to receive income or
proceeds therefrom or (iv) any other Securitization backed in whole or in part
by the Loan or any interest therein.

SECTION 10.2 COOPERATION; LIMITATIONS. The Borrower Parties shall use all
reasonable efforts and cooperate reasonably and in good faith with Lender in
effecting up to three (3) such restructuring or Secondary Market Transactions at
Lender's sole cost (other than, with respect to the first successful Secondary
Market Transaction only, each Borrower's internal costs and expenses and the
costs and expenses of the Borrowers' counsel). Such cooperation shall include
without limitation, executing and delivering such reasonable amendments to the
Loan Documents and the organizational documents of each Borrower as Lender or
any Interested Party (as defined below) may request, provided however that, no
such amendment shall modify (i) the weighted average interest rate payable under
the Note (or notes); (ii) the stated maturity date of the Note, (iii) the
amortization of the principal amount of the Note, (iv) any other material
economic terms of the Obligations, (v) the non-recourse provisions of the Loan
or (vi) any provision, the effect of which would increase the Borrowers'
obligations or decrease the Borrowers' rights under the Loan Documents except to
a de minimis extent. The Borrower Parties shall not be required to provide
additional collateral to effect any such restructuring or Secondary Market
Transaction after the Closing Date. The Borrower Parties shall not be required
to pay any third party (other than, with respect to the first successful
Secondary Market Transaction only, the costs and expenses of the Borrowers'
counsel) costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with any such
Secondary Market Transaction unless otherwise expressly payable by the Borrower
Parties under this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

SECTION 10.3 INFORMATION. The Borrower Parties, at Lender's cost and expense
(other than the Borrowers' internal costs and, with respect to the first
successful Secondary Market Transaction only, expenses and the costs and
expenses of the Borrowers' counsel), shall provide such access to personnel and
such information and documents relating to the Borrower Parties, Manager, the
Properties and Collateral and the business and operations of all of the
foregoing and access to such opinions of counsel (including nonconsolidation
opinions) as any Rating Agency may request or as Lender or any other Interested
Party may reasonably request in connection with any such Secondary Market
Transaction including, without limitation, updated financial information,
appraisals, market studies, environmental reviews (Phase I's and, if
appropriate, Phase II's), mold inspection, property condition reports and other
due diligence investigations together with appropriate verification of such
updated information and reports through letters of auditors and

                                       95

<PAGE>

consultants and, as of the closing date of the Secondary Market Transaction,
updated representations and warranties made in the Loan Documents and such
additional representations and warranties as any Rating Agency may request or
any purchaser, transferee, assignee, trustee, servicer or potential investor
(the Rating Agencies and all of the foregoing parties, collectively, "INTERESTED
PARTIES") may reasonably request, to the extent such updated representations and
warranties are true. On or prior to the date of closing of any Secondary Market
Transaction, the Borrowers, at Lender's cost and expense (other than the
Borrowers' internal costs and expenses and, with respect to the first successful
Secondary Market Transaction only, the costs and expenses of the Borrowers'
counsel), shall, if required by any Rating Agency or reasonably required by
Lender, provide revisions or "bringdowns" to any opinions delivered at Closing
(including nonconsolidation opinions), or if required by the Rating Agencies,
new versions of such opinions, which opinions shall be consistent in substance
with the opinions covered by the original opinions, addressed to Lender, any
trustee under any Securitization backed in whole or in part by the Loan, any
Rating Agency that assigns a rating to any securities in connection therewith
and any investor purchasing securities therein. Lender shall be permitted to
share all such information with the investment banking firms, Rating Agencies,
accounting firms, law firms, other third party advisory firms, potential
investors, servicers and other service providers and other parties directly
involved in any proposed Secondary Market Transaction. The Borrowers understand
that any such information may be incorporated into any offering circular,
prospectus, prospectus supplement, private placement memorandum or other
offering documents for any Secondary Market Transaction. Lender and the Rating
Agencies shall be entitled to rely upon such information. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Borrowers and Guarantor shall each provide in connection with
each of (i) a preliminary and a final private placement memorandum or (ii) a
preliminary and final prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable (the
documents referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the
"DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS"), an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Borrowers
and Guarantor certifying that the Borrowers and Guarantor have examined such
Disclosure Documents specified by Lender and, that the sections of such
Disclosure Document describing the Borrowers, Guarantor, the Properties and
Manager do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not materially misleading. The
Borrowers and Guarantor shall each indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless
Lender, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MERRILL LYNCH"),
and their respective Affiliates, directors, employees, agents and each Person,
if any, who controls Lender, Merrill Lynch or any such Affiliate within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 20 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and any other placement agent or underwriter
with respect to any Securitization or Secondary Market Transaction from and
against any losses, claims, damages and liabilities that arise out of or are
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact
contained in the Disclosure Document as to the Borrowers, Guarantor, Manager and
the Properties or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated in such
information or necessary in order to make the statements in such information not
materially misleading; provided, however, the Borrowers shall not be required to
indemnify Merrill Lynch for any liabilities arising out of untrue statements or
omissions that were identified to Lender in writing or are set forth in any
third party report not prepared by the Borrowers or their Affiliates unless such
reports are caused to be incorrect or misleading based upon information provided
by the Borrowers or their Affiliates. Lender may publicize the existence of

                                       96

<PAGE>

the Obligations in connection with Lender's Secondary Market Transaction
activities or otherwise.

SECTION 10.4 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. In any Secondary Market Transaction, Lender
may transfer its obligations under this Loan Agreement and under the other Loan
Documents (or may transfer the portion thereof corresponding to the transferred
portion of the Obligations), and thereafter Lender shall be relieved of any
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents arising after the date
of said transfer with respect to the transferred interest. Each transferee
investor shall become a "Lender" hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE XI
           RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS, TRANSFERS; ASSUMABILITY; RELEASE OF
                                   PROPERTIES

SECTION 11.1 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND ENCUMBRANCE. Except for a Transfer or
a Permitted Assumption expressly permitted under this Article XI, Leases entered
into as permitted hereunder, and pledges in connection with the Mezzanine Loan,
the Borrowers shall not cause or suffer to occur or exist, directly or
indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, by operation of law or otherwise, any
sale, transfer, mortgage, pledge, Lien or encumbrance (other than the Permitted
Encumbrances) of (i) all or any part of the Properties or any interest therein,
or (ii) any direct or indirect ownership or beneficial interest in any Borrower
(other than to Mezzanine Lender), irrespective of the number of tiers of
ownership without Lender's consent.

SECTION 11.2 TRANSFERS OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN BORROWERS. The following
voluntary or involuntary sales, encumbrances, conveyances, transfers and pledges
(each, a "TRANSFER") of a direct, indirect or beneficial interest in any
Borrower shall be permitted without Lender's consent ("PERMITTED OWNERSHIP
INTEREST TRANSFERS"):

         (A)      A Transfer of no more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the
direct or indirect ownership interests in such Borrower (in the aggregate),
provided that, following such Transfer, Guarantor maintains control of such
Borrower.

         (B)      A Transfer or a series of Transfers that result in the
proposed transferee, together with Affiliates of such transferee, owning in the
aggregate (directly or indirectly) more than forty-nine percent (49%) of the
economic and beneficial interests in such Borrower (where, prior to such
Transfer, such proposed transferee and its Affiliates owned in the aggregate
(directly or indirectly) forty-nine percent (49%) or less of such interests in
that Borrower); and, provided that such Transfer shall not be a Permitted
Ownership Interest Transfer unless Lender receives, prior to such Transfer, both
(x) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender (which shall include a legal
non-consolidation opinion reasonably acceptable to Lender and the Rating
Agencies) that the single purpose nature and bankruptcy remoteness of such
Borrower (and its members and general partners, as applicable) following such
Transfer or Transfers will be the same as prior to such Transfer or Transfers
and (y) a Rating Agency Confirmation.

         (C)      For so long as Guarantor's (or its successor's) stock is
traded through the "over-the-counter market" or through any recognized stock
exchange, any Transfer of all or any portion of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Guarantor, or the issuance of additional

                                       97

<PAGE>

capital stock of Guarantor (including common or preferred shares) through the
"over-the-counter market" or through any recognized stock exchange.

         (D)      The pledge of ownership interests granted by the Mezzanine
Borrowers pursuant to the Pledge Agreement (as such term is defined in the
Mezzanine Loan Agreement).

For purposes of this Section 11.2, "control" shall have the meaning given
thereto in the definition of "Affiliate" in Section 1.1 and a "change of
control" of any Person shall include the Transfer of legal or equitable
ownership interests in such Person which after giving effect to such Transfer
results in any transferee or pledgee of such interests holding more than a 49%
legal or equitable ownership interest or security interest in such Person.

SECTION 11.3 ASSUMABILITY.

         (A)      The Borrowers shall have the right to request that Lender
consent to (i) a transfer of all of the Properties to another Person (the
"TRANSFEREE BORROWER") and the assumption by the Transferee Borrower of all of
the Borrowers' obligations under the Loan Documents, (ii) replacement of
Guarantor with new guarantors and indemnitors who shall assume all of the
obligations of the Guarantors arising from and after such date and release of
the Borrowers and Guarantor from obligations arising after such date and (iii)
the replacement of the Mezzanine Borrowers with pledgors of the ownership
interests in the Transferee Borrower (collectively, an "ASSUMPTION"), subject to
the conditions set forth in paragraphs (C) and (D) of this Section. Together
with such written application, the Borrowers will pay to Lender the reasonable
review fee of $10,000. The Borrowers also shall pay on demand all of the
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of Rating
Agencies, if any, and other outside entities, in connection with considering any
proposed Transfer and Assumption, whether or not the same is permitted or
occurs.

         (B)      Lender shall not withhold its consent to an Assumption (any
such Assumption consented to by Lender, a "PERMITTED ASSUMPTION") provided and
upon the conditions that:

                  (i)      No Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such Assumption;

                  (ii)     The Borrowers shall have submitted to Lender true,
correct and complete copies of any and all information and documents reasonably
requested by Lender concerning the Transferee Borrower, replacement guarantors
and indemnitors and all of such information and documents shall be reasonably
acceptable to Lender;

                  (iii)    Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lender shall have
been provided showing that the Transferee Borrower and such of its Affiliates as
shall reasonably be designated by Lender comply and will comply with Article IX,
as those provisions may be modified by Lender taking into account the ownership
structure of Transferee Borrower and its Affiliates;

                  (iv)     The Borrowers shall have obtained (and delivered to

                                  ARTICLE XIII
                 WAIVERS OF DEFENSES OF GUARANTORS AND SURETIES

SECTION 13.1 WAIVERS. To the extent that any of the Borrowers (in this Article,
a "WAIVING PARTY") is deemed for any reason to be a guarantor or surety of or
for any other Borrower Party or Affiliate or to have rights or obligations in
the nature of the rights or obligations of a guarantor or surety (whether by
reason of execution of a guaranty, provision of security for the obligations of
another, or otherwise) then this Article shall apply. This Article shall not
affect the rights of the Waiving Party other than to waive or limit rights and
defenses that Waiving Party would have (i) in its capacity as a guarantor or
surety or (ii) in its capacity as one having rights or obligations in the nature
of a guarantor or surety.

         Waiving Party hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
filing of claims with a court in the event of receivership or bankruptcy of any
of the other Borrower Parties, protest or notice with respect to any of the
obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties, setoffs and counterclaims and
all presentments, demands for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests,
notices of protest, notices of dishonor and notices of acceptance, the benefits
of all statutes of limitation, and all other demands whatsoever (and shall not
require that the same be made on any of the other Borrower Parties as a
condition precedent to the obligations of Waiving Party), and covenants that the
Loan Documents will not be discharged, except by complete payment and
performance of the obligations evidenced and secured thereby, except only as
limited by the express contractual provisions of the Loan Documents. Waiving

                                      104

<PAGE>

Party further waives all notices that the principal amount, or any portion
thereof, and/or any interest on any instrument or document evidencing all or any
part of the obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties to Lender is due,
notices of any and all proceedings to collect from any of the other Borrower
Parties or any endorser or any other guarantor of all or any part of their
obligations, or from any other person or entity, and, to the extent permitted by
law, notices of exchange, sale, surrender or other handling of any security or
collateral given to Lender to secure payment of all or any part of the
obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties.

         Except only to the extent provided otherwise in the express contractual
provisions of the Loan Documents, Waiving Party hereby agrees that all of its
obligations under the Loan Documents shall remain in full force and effect,
without defense, offset or counterclaim of any kind, notwithstanding that any
right of Waiving Party against any of the other Borrower Parties or defense of
Waiving Party against Lender may be impaired, destroyed, or otherwise affected
by reason of any action or inaction on the part of Lender. Waiving Party waives
all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by the Lender,
even though that election of remedies, may have destroyed the Waiving Party's
rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the other Borrower Parties.

         Lender is hereby authorized, without notice or demand, from time to
time, (a) to renew, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment
of, or other terms relating to, all or any part of the obligations of any of the
other Borrower Parties; (b) to accept partial payments on all or any part of the
obligations of any of the other Borrower Parties; (c) to take and hold security
or collateral for the payment of all or any part of the obligations of any of
the other Borrower Parties; (d) to exchange, enforce, waive and release any such
security or collateral for such obligations; (e) to apply such security or
collateral and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as in its discretion
it may determine; (f) to settle, release, exchange, enforce, waive, compromise
or collect or otherwise liquidate all or any part of such obligations and any
security or collateral for such obligations. Any of the foregoing may be done in
any manner, and Waiving Party agrees that the same shall not affect or impair
the obligations of Waiving Party under the Loan Documents.

         Waiving Party hereby assumes responsibility for keeping itself informed
of the financial condition of all of the other Borrower Parties and any and all
endorsers and/or other guarantors of all or any part of the obligations of the
other Borrower Parties, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of such obligations, and Waiving Party hereby agrees that Lender
shall have no duty to advise Waiving Party of information known to it regarding
such condition or any such circumstances.

         Waiving Party agrees that neither Lender nor any person or entity
acting for or on behalf of Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any
assets in favor of Waiving Party or against or in payment of any or all of the
obligations secured hereby. Waiving Party further agrees that, to the extent
that any of the other Borrower Parties or any other guarantor of all or any part
of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties makes a payment or payments to
Lender, or Lender receives any proceeds of collateral for any of the obligations
of the other Borrower Parties, which payment or payments or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid or refunded, then, to the extent of such payment or
repayment, the part of such obligations which has been paid,

                                      105

<PAGE>

reduced or satisfied by such amount shall be reinstated and continued in full
force and effect as of the time immediately preceding such initial payment,
reduction or satisfaction.

         Waiving Party (i) shall have no right of subrogation with respect to
the obligations of the other Borrower Parties; (ii) waives any right to enforce
any remedy that Lender now has or may hereafter have against any of the other
Borrower Parties any endorser or any guarantor of all or any part of such
obligations or any other person; and (iii) waives any benefit of, and any right
to participate in, any security or collateral given to Lender to secure the
payment or performance of all or any part of such obligations or any other
liability of the other parties to Lender.

         Waiving Party agrees that any and all claims that it may have against
any of the other Borrower Parties, any endorser or any other guarantor of all or
any part of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties, or against any of
their respective properties, shall be subordinate and subject in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all obligations secured hereby.
Notwithstanding any right of any of the Waiving Party to ask, demand, sue for,
take or receive any payment from the other Borrower Parties, all rights, liens
and security interests of Waiving Party, whether now or hereafter arising and
howsoever existing, in any assets of any of the other Borrower Parties (whether
constituting part of the security or collateral given to Lender to secure
payment of all or any part of the obligations of the other Borrower Parties or
otherwise) shall be and hereby are subordinated to the rights of Lender in those
assets.

         4.       You represent and warrant to us that you are not party to any
contract that would conflict with this Agreement. If the Hotel is presently
operated under a franchise agreement with another franchisor, this Agreement is
contingent on you furnishing verification satisfactory to us within thirty (30)
days, but in any event before entering the System, evidencing your right to
terminate the other franchise. Furthermore, you agree to defend, indemnify and
hold us harmless against any claims, losses, or liabilities that may be asserted
against us by the other franchisor arising out of or related to the termination
of the other franchise, including tortious interference with contractual
relations or similar claims.

         5.       The secondary name "Airport" may be used so long as the Hotel
is located within five (5) miles of the airport, you provide or have arranged
transportation to and from the airport upon guest demand (this service does not
need to be complimentary) and you must have a direct-dial telephone in the
terminal of the airport. In the event any of the aforementioned requirements
have not been met or cease to be met, the Hotel will not be authorized to use
the secondary name.

         6.       We agree that you may use the secondary name of airport. Your
property will now be referred to as "CLARION HOTEL Airport". Please bear in mind
that our approval of this secondary marketing name does not grant you a
contractual right to use this name indefinitely. If the circumstances, market
conditions, or our criteria change, we reserve the right to revoke our approval
of this secondary name at a later date.

         7.       Subject to the provisions of paragraph 8 below, paragraph 4(b)

                  (a)      "You must pay to Us a monthly Royalty Fee as follows:

                           beginning on the Opening Date, a sum equal to 3.13%
                           of the Gross Room Revenues for each month.

                  (b)      "You must pay to Us a monthly Marketing Fee as
                           follows:

                           beginning on the Opening Date, a sum equal to 0.83%
                           of the Gross Room Revenues for each month.

         We may increase the Marketing Fee for increases in inflation or costs
of advertising, publicity, public relations or marketing so long as any the
increases apply to all or most of the U.S. hotels in the System unless we get
your approval to a greater amount.

                  (c)      "You must pay to Us a monthly Reservations Fee as
                           follows:

                           the Gross Room Revenues for each month.

express  conditions that you permit no material  default of your  obligations in
this Agreement (including any Addenda thereto) to continue for more than 30 days
or, after the Opening  Date,  that you not receive a failing  Quality  Assurance
Review  score in any of the  categories  which are scored  (i.e.,  Housekeeping,
Mandatory or Maintenance & Capital  Improvements).  "Material  default" includes
non payment of any fees or other monies  required to be paid by this  Agreement.
In the  event  either  of  the  aforementioned  deficiencies  shall  occur,  the
modification(s) referred to in paragraph 7 shall thereafter automatically become
null  and  void  and  shall  not  be  reinstated  even  if  the  conditions  are
subsequently  removed  and  paragraph  4(b) of the  Agreement  thereto  shall be
reinstated. Such modification is exclusive to you and is not transferable to any
other party.

         9.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in paragraph 10
of the  Agreement,  if the  Hotel  is  sold  to a bona  fide  purchaser  and the
purchaser  does not enter into a  Franchise  Agreement  with us for the Hotel or
does not assume  this  Agreement,  the amount of  liquidated  damages  shall not
exceed  $25,000 so long as liquidated  damages and all fees  accruing  under the
Agreement are paid in certified funds within 30 days from the sale of the Hotel.

         10. Notwithstanding anything contained in paragraph 9(b) of the
Agreement, you may transfer a direct or indirect interest in the Hotel or in
this Agreement to a limited liability company, a corporation or a partnership
formed within 60 months of the date of this Agreement without payment of any

         (b)      You are not in default under this Agreement;

         (c)      You execute and deliver to us a general release of all claims

                  limited liability company, corporation or partnership after
                  the transfer;

         (e)      You agree that you are not relieved of your obligation under
                  this Agreement unless we specifically release you in writing;

         (f)      Your successor assumes, in a writing that we accept, your
                  obligations under this Agreement;

         (g)      Your successor submits evidence to us that it owns the Hotel;
                  and

         (h)      We approve of the transfer after a credit and legal review.

         11. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if we approve and enter
into 2 additional franchise agreements with you for NE069-CLHO (Omaha) and
IA078-QIIN (Council Bluffs) by September 10, 2000, then the Affiliation Fee
pursuant to paragraph 4(a) of this Agreement will be $25,000, the discounted
fees contained in paragraph 7 of Addendum No. 1 will be in effect and
liquidated damages pursuant to paragraph 9 of Addendum No. 1 will be in effect.
The additional franchise agreements will be entitled to the same discounted
fees in this Agreement. If we do not approve and enter into the 2 additional
franchise agreements with you pursuant to this paragraph, then the affiliation
fee will be $40,000 and you must pay the balance according to the terms of the
attached Promissory Note that you will execute, and the modification(s)
referred to in paragraphs 7 and 9 shall thereafter automatically become null
and void and paragraph 4(b) of the Agreement shall be reinstated. If we do
execute the 2 additional franchise agreements with you, then we will waive the
terms of the Promissory Note.

                                    EXTERIOR
================================================================================

This is a six-story interior corridor hotel. It was converted to a Doubletree
Club hotel approximately six years ago. The actual building is twenty-eight
years old. The curb appeal is average at best. The repair of the damaged canopy
ceiling and the addition of decorative pavers under the canopy will help create
a sense of arrival for guests. The numerous areas of ceiling damaged throughout
the interior of the property indicate the need for a new roof. There is a
missing section of mansard that will also need to be replaced.

=====================================================================================================
Closing   The gift shop has been eliminated and is now currently being             6 months
          used as a vending area. There are numerous vending machines
          lining the walls. Although a vending area is required on each floor,
          this space could potentially be used as an arcade area or other
          amenity for guests. Approval must be obtained and specifications
          must be submitted for approval. An arcade would require a door
          (with view panel) to reduce the noise level as this area is adjacent
          to the registration area. As a vending area, vinyl wall
          covering must be added and ceramic floor tile installed.

The swimming pool area is in very poor condition. It is covered by a dome type
structure that will need to be replaced, repaired, or removed. It is cracking
and the leaks from the cracks and condensation create a need for constant
operational attention. This area will require a complete

The guestrooms are dated and in severe need of a complete facelift. Carpet,
bedspreads, mattresses and box springs, window treatment, wall vinyl all need to
be replaced. On the positive side, the guestrooms are large and there is
tremendous potential with a new room package in place. The undersized desk will
need to be replaced with the larger executive workspace and an ergonomic desk
chair must also be added. The required new lamp package must also contain a task
lamp for the desk surface.

pursuant to an agreement of lease dated February 6, 1981, which lease was
recorded February 16, 1981, in Deed Book 391, page 79 in the Office of the Judge

(the "Loan") secured by a first leasehold mortgage upon Tenant's interest as
tenant in the Lease.

                  WHEREAS, Lender is unwilling to make the Loan unless Landlord

                  NOW THEREFORE, Landlord hereby certifies to Lender as follows:

                  1.       Without implying that Landlord's acknowledgment or

                  5.       Landlord hereby agrees that for so long as any sums

written consent of both Lender and Mezzanine Lender: (a) notwithstanding any
provisions of the Lease to the contrary, accept, consent to or join in the

(b) permit or accept the

<PAGE>

exercise by Tenant of any right it may have to purchase the Premises without
having first obtained Lender's written consent thereto. To the extent Lender
shall have approved any such exercise by Tenant of such right, the conveyance
instrument executed in connection therewith shall expressly provide for the
preservation of the leasehold under the Lease, and for the non-merger of the fee
and leasehold estates in the Premises.

                  6.       Landlord hereby confirms with respect to the new
lease referred to in Section 5 of the 1995 Amendment that should Lender or

                  7.       Landlord acknowledges that as between Landlord and
Lender, its nominee, or a purchaser at a foreclosure or other sale, the Lease
shall not be deemed to be terminated, notwithstanding the rejection of the Lease
by the Tenant thereunder or its representative in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. ) (the "Bankruptcy Code") or any
other insolvency law. Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to
commence foreclosure proceedings by asserting a claim in a proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency proceeding, and Lender shall not be deemed
to have failed to satisfy such obligation if Lender is unable to do so as a
result of the provisions of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar
provisions of any other insolvency law.

                  8.       Landlord acknowledges that Lender shall have the
right to act on behalf of Tenant in any proceeding commenced by or against
Landlord under the Bankruptcy Code.

                  9.       Landlord acknowledges that Lender and Mezzanine
Lender have requested that Landlord execute this Agreement in connection with
the Loan and the Mezzanine Loan, and that Lender has agreed to make the Loan and
Mezzanine Lender has agreed to make the Mezzanine Loan in reliance on the
matters set forth herein.

                  10.      Landlord hereby confirms that pursuant to Section 1
of the 1995 Amendment, any mortgage placed by Landlord on the fee estate of the
Premises shall be subject to and subordinate to the terms of this Lease and the
Leasehold Mortgage.

                  11.      Landlord hereby certifies as follows:

                           the Premises and there are currently no fee simple

                           encumbering the fee estate in the Premises.

                  6.       In the event Lender shall acquire, assume or succeed
to Lessee's interest under the Lease, then in such event, so long as Lender is
not in default in the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions
of the Lease on Lessee's part to be performed and has cured all prior defaults,
Lender's possession under the Lease and Lender's rights and privileges
thereunder, or under any extensions thereof which may be effected in accordance
with any option therefor contained in the Lease, shall not be diminished or
interfered with by Lessor, and Lender's occupancy shall not be disturbed by
Lessor during the term of the Lease or any such extensions or renewals thereof.

                  7.       Lender understands and agrees that Lessor is neither
a party to the Loan nor are Lessor's fee title and Lessor's interest in the
Lease subordinate to the security interest of the Mortgage on the lessee's
interest in the Lease.

                  8.       Lessor hereby agrees that either Lender or Mezzanine
Lender shall have the right, pursuant to the terms of the Lease, to exercise
either of the remaining two (2) options to renew the term of the Lease, if the
Lessee shall fail to do so, whether or not an event of default under the
Mortgage shall have occurred, provided that Lender or Mezzanine Lender shall do
so strictly in accordance with the Lease. In the event Lender or Mezzanine
Lender does so exercise any option to renew, Lender or Mezzanine Lender shall
become obligated with the Lessee for the performance of the obligations set
forth in the Lease.

                  9.       Lessor hereby agrees that for so long as any sums in
respect of the Loan remain outstanding, it shall not, without the prior written
consent of both Lender and Mezzanine Lender: (a) notwithstanding any provisions
of the Lease to the contrary, accept, consent to or join in the execution of any
instrument purporting to (i) effect the termination, prior to April 30, 2022, of
the Lease by Lessee, or (ii) amend or modify the Lease; (b) permit or accept the
exercise by Lessee of any right it may have to purchase the Leased Premises
without having first obtained Lender's written consent thereto. To the extent
Lender shall have approved any such exercise by Lessee of such right, the
conveyance instrument executed in connection therewith

                                       3

<PAGE>

shall expressly provide for the preservation of the leasehold under the Lease,
and for the non-merger of the fee and leasehold estates in the Leased Premises.

                  10.      Lessor's fee simple interest in the Leased Premises
and the Lessor's interest under the Lease are not encumbered.

                  11.      Lessor acknowledges that as between Lessor and
Lender, its nominee, or a purchaser at a foreclosure or other sale, the Lease
shall not be deemed to be terminated, notwithstanding the rejection of the Lease
by the Lessee thereunder or its representative in any proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. ) (the "Bankruptcy Code") or any
other insolvency law. Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to
commence foreclosure proceedings by asserting a claim in a proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency proceeding, and Lender shall not be deemed
to have failed to satisfy such obligation if Lender is unable to do so as a
result of the provisions of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar
provisions of any other insolvency law.

                  12.      Lessor acknowledges that Lender shall have the right
to act on behalf of Lessee in any proceeding commenced by or against Lessor
under the Bankruptcy Code.

                  13.      Lessor acknowledges that Lender and Mezzanine Lender
have requested that Lessor execute this Agreement in connection with the Loan
and the Mezzanine Loan, and that Lender has agreed to make the Loan and
Mezzanine Lender has agreed to make the Mezzanine Loan in reliance on the
matters set forth herein.

                  14.      Lessor hereby agrees that for so long as any sums in
respect of the Loan remain outstanding, notwithstanding any provisions of the
Lease to the contrary, in the event of a casualty to or condemnation affecting
the Leased Premises, Lender shall be entitled to receive all insurance proceeds
and condemnation awards and apply the same in accordance with the terms of the
loan documents entered into between Lessee and Lender in connection with the
Loan, and shall have the right, but not the obligation, to restore the Leased
Premises

                  15.      This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and
each such counterpart shall constitute an original.

                  16.      Except as amended hereby, the Lease and all the
terms, covenants and conditions thereof remain unchanged and in full force and
effect, and the Lease, as amended hereby, is hereby ratified and confirmed in
all respects.

                  17.      The parties agree that the protections and rights
granted to the Lender and Mezzanine Lender by this Agreement shall also apply to
any other prospective mortgages of Lessee's interest in the Lease or any other
prospective pledgee of the ownership interests in Lessee, provided that the name
and address of such lender is provided in writing to Lessor, and such other
lender shall be deemed the "Servicer" or the "Leasehold Mortgagee" for the
purposes of this Agreement and for the purposes of the Lease.

                  18.      This Agreement shall be binding upon, and may be
relied upon by, the parties, their successors and assigns, and the terms hereof
shall inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.

"Bankruptcy Code") or any other insolvency law provided Lender shall, from and
after the date it acquires the lessee's interests in the Assigned Interests,
comply with the lessee's obligations under the Lease Agreements.

accrued prior to the date of this Agreement have been fully performed; (g)
Exhibit "A" lists the only instruments governing Lessor's and Lessee's rights
and obligations with respect to the Leased Premises; and (h) to the best of
Lessor's knowledge, the Option to purchase the Leased Premises granted by Lessor
in favor of Lessee expired on June 30, 2002.

         6.       Lender understands and agrees that Lessor is neither a party
to the Loan nor are Lessor's fee title and Lessor's interest in the Lease
subordinate to the security interest of the Leasehold Mortgage on the lessee's
interest in the Lease.

         7.       Lessor's fee simple interest in the Leased Premises and the
Lessor's interest under the Lease are encumbered by the liens described on
Exhibit "C" attached hereto and made a part hereof, in the approximate current
principal balance(s) shown on Exhibit "C."

         8.       Lessor acknowledges that Lender has requested that Lessor
execute this Agreement in connection with the Loan, and that Lender has agreed
to make the Loan in reliance on the matters set forth herein.

         9.       This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each such
counterpart shall constitute an original.

         10.      Except as amended hereby, the Lease and all the terms,
covenants and conditions thereof remain unchanged and in full force and effect,
and the Lease, as amended hereby, is hereby ratified and confirmed in all
respects.

         11.      The parties agree that the protections and rights granted to
the Lender by this Agreement shall also apply to any other prospective mortgagee
of Lessee's interest in the Lease or any other prospective pledgee of the
ownership interests in Lessee, provided that the name and address of such lender
is provided in writing to Lessor, and such other lender shall be deemed the
"Servicer" or the "Leasehold Mortgagee" for the purposes of this Agreement and
for the purposes of the Lease.

         12.      This Agreement shall be binding upon, and may be relied upon
by, the parties, their successors and assigns, and the terms hereof shall inure
to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.

         Re: Holiday Inn, Glen Burnie, MD

         Dear Sir/Madam:

         Prime has been requested by our tenant to provide you with information
         concerning our lease of the hotel premises described on Schedule A to
         his letter.

         1.       The lease consists of an agreement dated May 10, 1968 by and
                  between David H. Greenberg and Janice C. Greenberg and A.O.
                  Krisch, Joel Krisch and Rosalie K. Shaftman, as amended by
                  Amendment to Lease dated February 24, 1971, Second Amendment
                  to Lease dated August 22, 1975, and Amendment to Lease dated
                  as of December 20, 1986, all attached to this letter.

         2.       The present monthly rental is $2,000 and rent has been paid
                  through November 30, 2002.

         3.       There is no notice of default outstanding and uncured. Prime
                  is not aware of the occurrence of any event of default that is
                  uncured.

         4.       Prime will forward to Merrill Lynch Mortgage Lending, Inc.
                  ("Merrill") a copy of any notice sent to tenant, to the extent
                  that the Lease requires a copy of such notice to be sent to
                  the "Servicer," as defined in the Lease. The failure of Prime
                  to forward to Merrill a copy of any other notice or
                  communication to tenant shall not limit Prime's rights under
                  the Lease nor create any liability or obligation to Merrill,
                  the tenant, or another party. Required notices will be sent to
                  the following addresses unless Prime is otherwise notified by
                  Merrill in writings;

Code or similar provisions of any other insolvency law.

         10.      Lessor acknowledges that Lender has requested that Lessor
execute this Agreement in connection with the Loan, and that Lender has agreed
to make the Loan in reliance on the matters set forth herein.

                      ACKNOWLEDGMENT, ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE
                                 AND AGREEMENT
                             (Lancaster, PA - East)

         THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT, ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE AND AGREEMENT ("Agreement")
is executed and delivered as of this 14th day of November, 2002, among JOYCE A.
BRISTOW, as Personal Representative of the estate of Dorothy H. Herr,
("Lessor"); MERRILL LYNCH MORTGAGE LENDING, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Lender") and AMI OPERATING PARTNERS, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
("Lessee").

                                    RECITALS

         A.       Lessor is the lessor under the ground lease described on
Exhibit "A" hereto between Lessor, as lessor, and Lessee, as lessee, affecting
the real property ("Land") and improvements ("improvements") known as and
located at 521 Greenfield Road, Lancaster, Pennsylvania 17601 more particularly
described on Exhibit "B" hereto (the Land and Improvements, collectively, the
"Leased Premises"; such lease, as so amended and assigned, and as it may be
further amended and assigned from time to time, the "Lease");

         B.       Lessee is now in the process of obtaining from Lender a
refinancing loan (the  "Loan ") to be secured by, among other things, a mortgage
and collateral assignment of all of Lessee's interests under the Lease;

         C.       In order to facilitate the transactions described herein,
Lessor has agreed to enter into this Agreement, without which Lender would not
make the Loan.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars ($10.00),
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, Lessor agrees as follows:

         1.       Without implying herein that Lessor's acknowledgment or
consent may be required under the Lease, Lessor does hereby acknowledge (a) the
granting by Lessee of a leasehold mortgage ("Leasehold Mortgage") to Lender on
Lessee's interests in the Leased Premises (b) the pledge of the ownership
interests in the Lessee by the holder or holders of all ownership interests in
Lessee (i.e. the mezzanine borrower) to the applicable Merrill Lynch mezzanine
lending entity (together with its successors and assigns, the "Mezzanine
Lender") as security for a mezzanine loan (the "Mezzanine Loan") and the right
of Mezzanine Lender to foreclose on such ownership interests in the event of a
default under the Mezzanine Loan and (c) the address for delivery of notices to
Lender and Mezzanine Lender as set forth below. Upon the mortgaging of the
Leased Premises, the pledge of the ownership interests in Lessee pursuant to the
Mezzanine Loan and the execution of this Agreement, Lessor acknowledges and
agrees that both Lender and Mezzanine Lender shall be deemed to be, and shall
have all of the rights and protections granted to the "Servicer" under the
Lease.

         2.       Lessor and Lessee hereby certify to Lender that: (a) Lessor is
the current owner of (i) the fee interest in the Leased Premises, and (ii) all
of the rights and benefits of "Lessor" under the Lease; (b) all rents and other
sums due and owing under the Lease as of the date hereof are current and not in
arrears; (c) there exists no uncured default under the Lease by Lessor or

<PAGE>

Lessee; (d) the Lease is in full force and effect; (e) the current renewal term
of the Lease expires June 30, 2024, and Lessee has remaining two (2) 20-year
options to renew the term; (f) all of the material obligations under the Lease
which have accrued prior to the date of this Agreement have been fully
performed; and (g) Exhibit "A" lists the only instruments governing Lessor's and
Lessee's rights and obligations with respect to the Leased Premises.

         3.       The annual rental for the current period (08/01/99 through
07/30/04) is $67,456, payable $5,621,34 per month. Annual rental shall next be
adjusted in August, 2004, to be effective for the 5-year period beginning
08/01/04. Rent is due in advance on the 1st day of each month. Rent is paid
through November, 2002 and the next rent payment is due on December 1, 2002.

         4.       Lessor confirms that, notwithstanding any provisions of the
Lease to the contrary, in the event of casualty to the Improvements on the
Leased Premises, insurance proceeds in respect of such casualty shall be paid to
and held by Lender for Lender's disbursement to Lessee for repair and/or
reconstruction of the Improvements.

         5.       In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Lease,
Lessor has at all times complied with the covenants regarding non-competition
contained therein.

         6.       Unless otherwise notified by Lender or Mezzanine Lender,
copies of any notices to Lender or Mezzanine Lender, as the case may be, shall
be sent to the following addresses:

                  Facsimile: (212) 839-5599

         7.       In the event Lender shall acquire, assume or succeed to
Lessee's interest under the Lease, then in such event, so long as Lender is not
in default in the performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
the Lease on Lessee's part to be performed, Lender's possession under the Lease
and Lender's rights and privileges thereunder, or under any extensions or
renewals thereof which may be effected in accordance with any option therefor
contained in the Lease, shall not be diminished or interfered with by Lessor,
and Lender's occupancy shall not be disturbed by Lessor during the term of the
Lease or any such extensions or renewals thereof.

         8.       Lender understands and agrees that Lessor is neither a party
to the Loan nor are Lessor's fee title and Lessor's interest in the Lease
subordinate to the security interest of the Leasehold Mortgage on the lessee's
interest in the Lease.

         9.       Lessor's Encumbrances. Lessor's fee simple interest in the
Leased Premises and the Lessor's interest under the Lease are not encumbered.

         10.      Lessor hereby agrees that either Lender or Mezzanine Lender
shall have the right, pursuant to the terms of the Lease, to exercise the
remaining two (2) options to renew the term of the Lease, if the Lessee shall
fail to do so, whether or not an event of default under the Leasehold Mortgage
shall have occurred, provided that Lender or Mezzanine Lender shall do so
strictly in accordance with the Lease. In the event Lender or Mezzanine Lender
does so exercise any option to renew, Lender or Mezzanine Lender shall become
obligated with the Lessee for the performance of the obligations set forth in
the Lease.

         11.      Lessor hereby agrees that for so long as any sums in respect
of the Loan remain outstanding, it shall not, without the prior written consent
of both Lender and Mezzanine Lender: (a) notwithstanding any provisions of the
Lease to the contrary, accept, consent to or join in the execution of any
instrument purporting to (i) effect the termination, prior to June 30, 2024, of
the Lease by Lessee, or (ii) amend or modify the Lease with respect to the term,
amounts payable by

<PAGE>

the Lessee thereunder, the protections afforded to Lender as a leasehold
mortgagee thereunder or other material non-monetary modifications and shall give
Lender written notice of any other proposed modification thirty (30) days prior
to the effective date; (b) permit or accept the exercise by Lessee of any right
it may have to purchase the Leased Premises without having first obtained
Lender's written consent thereto. To the extent Lender shall have approved any
such exercise by Lessee of such right, the conveyance instrument executed in
connection therewith shall expressly provide for the preservation of the
leasehold under the Lease, and for the non-merger of the fee and leasehold
estates in the Leased Premises.

         12.      Lessor acknowledges that as between Lessor and Lender, its
nominee or a purchaser at a foreclosure or other sale, the Lease shall not be
deemed to be terminated notwithstanding the rejection of the Lease by the Lessee
thereunder or its representative in any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code (11
U. S. C. Section 101 et seq.) (the "Bankruptcy Code") or any other insolvency
law. Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied its obligation to commence
foreclosure proceedings by asserting a claim in a proceeding under the
Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency proceeding, and Lender shall not be deemed
to have failed to satisfy such obligation if Lender is unable to do so as a
result of the provisions of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar
provisions of any other insolvency law, provided all arrearages and rents are
paid within ninety (90) days of the institution of the bankruptcy proceeding.

         13.      Lessor acknowledges that Lender and Mezzanine Lender have
requested that Lessor execute this Agreement in connection with the Loan and the
Mezzanine Loan, and that Lender has agreed to make the Loan and Mezzanine Lender
has agreed to make the Mezzanine Loan in reliance on the matters set forth
herein.

         14.      This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and each such
counterpart shall constitute an original.

         15.      Except as amended hereby, the Lease and all the terms,
covenants and conditions thereof remain unchanged and in full force and effect,
and the Lease, as amended hereby, is hereby ratified and confirmed in all
respects.

         16.      The parties agree that the protections and rights granted to
the Lender and Mezzanine Lender by this Agreement shall also apply to any other
prospective mortgagee of Lessee's interest in the Lease or any other prospective
pledgee of the ownership interests in Lessee, provided that the name and address
of such lender is provided in writing to Lessor, and such other lender shall be
deemed the "Servicer" or the "Leasehold Mortgagee" for the purposes of this
Agreement and for the purposes of the Lease.

         17.      This Agreement shall be binding upon, and may be relied upon
by, the parties, their successors and assigns, and the terms hereof shall inure
to the benefit of the parties, their successors and assigns.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed Agreement as of
the date and year first above written.
