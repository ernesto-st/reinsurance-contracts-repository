<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.1.&#9;<U>Costs<B> </B>of Preparation; Brokers Fees</U>.  Borrower shall bear all reasonable expenses of the Bank in connection with the Loan(s) and with the investigation, review and approval of this transaction, the preparation of this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and the issuance and delivery of the Note or any Term Loan Note(s) to Bank and also in connection with any amendment or modification thereto, and the administration thereof, including, without limitation, (i) all legal fees, expenses and disbursements and other actual third-party expense reimbursements incurred or sustained by Bank in connection with this transaction, (ii) all travel, appraisal, audit, search and filing fees incurred or sustained by Bank in connection with this transaction or the administration of the Loan(s); (iii) all recording and filing fees, intangibles taxes, documentary and revenue stamps, other taxes or other expenses and charges payable in connection with this Agreement, the Note, any Term Loan Note(s) or any Loan Document and (iv) all costs, expenses (including fees and expenses of outside consultants), related to the administration of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and/or periodic audits and appraisals performed by Bank.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.3.&#9;<U>Legal Counsel</U>.  Borrower acknowledges and agrees that legal counsel to Bank does not represent Borrower as Borrower's attorney, that Borrower has retained (or has had an opportunity to retain) counsel of its own choice and has not and will not rely upon any advice from Bank's counsel.  In no event shall Borrower's reimbursement of expenses pursuant to this Agreement (even if effected by payment directly by Borrower to Bank's counsel) be deemed to establish any attorney-client relationship between Borrower and Bank's counsel.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.5.&#9;<U>Headings</U>.  Except for the definitions set forth in Section 1, the headings of the articles, sections, paragraphs and subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part hereof, and shall not limit or otherwise affect any of the terms hereof.</P>

Borrower consents to the service of process relating to any such action or proceeding by mail to the address set forth in this Agreement.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.10.&#9;<U>Continuing Obligation; Benefits</U>.  This Agreement, and each and every provision hereof, is a continuing obligation and shall (i) be binding upon the Borrower and the Bank, their successors and assigns, and (ii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Borrower and Bank and their successors and assigns; provided, that the Borrower may not assign all or any part of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Bank, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of Bank.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.11.&#9;<U>Controlling Law</U>.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to conflict or choice of law principles.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.12.&#9;<U>Standard of Review</U>.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, any document, writing or instrument required or permitted to be delivered to Bank under this Agreement shall be deemed satisfactory only if approved by Bank in the exercise of its sole discretion, and any act or approval permitted to be done by Bank under this Agreement shall be in Bank's sole discretion.  Where in this Agreement reference is made to Bank's "discretion," or "sole discretion," said reference shall mean that with respect to the matter so designated, Bank shall have the absolute right to make decision with respect thereto and shall not be subject to any standard of good faith, fair dealing, reasonableness, or any other standard implied by any court or imposed by law, it being the intention of the parties that the decision of the Bank with respect to said matter shall be absolutely final and binding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.13.&#9;<U>Participation</U>.  Borrower acknowledges that Bank may, at its option, sell participation interests in the Loan(s) to participating banks.  The amounts of any such participations shall be determined solely by the Bank.  Borrower agrees with each present and future participant in the Loan(s), the names and addresses of which will be furnished to Borrower, that if an Event of Default should occur, each present and future participant shall have all of the rights and remedies of Bank with respect to any deposit due from any participant to Borrower.  The execution by a participant of a participation agreement with Bank, and the execution by Borrower of this Agreement, regardless of the order of execution, shall evidence an agreement between Borrower and said participant in accordance with the terms of this Section&nbsp;11.13.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.14.&#9;<U>Miscellaneous</U>.  This Agreement and the instruments and agreements referred to herein or called for hereby supersede and incorporate all representations, promises, and statements, oral or written, made by the Borrower and the Bank in connection with the Loan.  This Agreement may not be varied, altered, or amended except by a written instrument executed by an authorized officer of the Borrower and the Bank.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.  Any provision in this Agreement which may be unenforceable or invalid under any law shall be ineffective to the extent of such unenforceability or invalidity without affecting the enforceability or validity of any other provisions hereof.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.15.&#9;<U>General Waivers</U>.  To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower waives (i) presentment, demand and protest and notice of presentment, protest, default, nonpayment, maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension or renewal of any or all commercial paper, accounts, contract rights, documents, instruments, chattel paper and guaranties at any time held by Bank on which Borrower may in any way be liable; (ii) the benefit of all valuation, appraisement and exemption laws; and (iii) notice of Bank's acceptance hereof or of any Loan Document.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.16.&#9;<U>Maximum Interest</U>.  Regardless of any provision contained in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, in no event shall the aggregate of all amounts that are contracted for, charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Note, any Term Note(s) or any of the Loan Documents, and that are deemed interest under Applicable Law, exceed the Maximum Rate.  No provision of this Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents or the exercise by Bank of any right hereunder or under any Loan Document or the prepayment by Borrower of any of the Obligations or the occurrence of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle Bank to charge or receive, or to require Borrower to pay, interest or any amounts deemed interest by Applicable Law (such amounts being referred to herein collectively as "Interest") in excess of the Maximum Rate, and all provisions hereof or in any Loan Document which may purport to require Borrower to pay Interest exceeding the Maximum Rate shall be without binding force or effect to the extent only of the excess of Interest over such Maximum Rate.  Any Interest charged or received in excess of the Maximum Rate ("Excess"), shall be conclusively presumed to be the result of an accident and bona fide error, and shall, to the extent received by Bank, at the option of Bank, either be applied to reduce the principal amount of the Obligations or returned to Borrower.  The right to accelerate the maturity of any of the Obligations does not include the right to accelerate unaccrued interest, and no such interest will be collected by Bank.  All moneys paid to Bank hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents shall be subject to any rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by Applicable Law.  By the execution of this Agreement, Borrower covenants that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against Bank, based in whole or in part upon contracting for, charging or receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate.  For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by Bank, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from Borrower in connection with this Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full term of the Obligations.  Borrower and Bank shall, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof.  The provisions of this Section&nbsp;10.16 shall be deemed to be incorporated into the Note, any Term Note(s) and each Loan Document (whether or not any provision of this Section&nbsp;10.16 is referred to therein).</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.17.&#9;<U>Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury</U>.  <B>Borrower and Bank hereby waive any right to trial by jury on any claim, counterclaim, setoff, demand, action or cause of action (a) arising out of or in any way pertaining or relating to this Agreement, the Note, any Term Note(s), the Loan Documents, or any other instrument, document or agreement executed or delivered in connection with this agreement or (b) in any way connected with or pertaining or related to or incidental to any dealings of the parties hereto with respect to this agreement, the Note, any Term Note(s), the Loan Documents, or any other instrument, document or agreement executed or delivered in connection herewith or in connection with the transactions related thereto or contemplated thereby or the exercise of either party's rights and remedies thereunder, in all of the foregoing cases whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise.  Borrower and Bank agree that either or both of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive trial by jury, and that any dispute or controversy whatsoever between them shall instead be tried in a court of competent jurisdiction by a judge sitting without a jury.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.18&#9;<U>Bank Not in Control; No Partnership.</U>  None of the covenants of other provisions contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be deemed to, give Bank the right or power to exercise control over the affairs or management of Borrower, the power of Bank being limited to the rights to exercise the remedies referred to in the Loan Documents.  The relationship between Borrower and Bank is, and at all times shall remain, solely that of debtor and creditor.  No covenant or provision of the Loan Documents is intended, nor shall it be deemed or construed, to create a partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income between Bank and Borrower.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Loan Documents: (1)&nbsp;Bank is not, and shall not be construed as, a partner, joint venturer, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other business associate or participant of any kind of Borrower or its stockholders, members, or partners and Bank does not intent to ever assume such status; (2)&nbsp;Bank shall in no event be liable for any Debts, expenses or losses incurred or sustained by Borrower; and (3)&nbsp;Bank shall not be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Borrower or its stockholders, members, or partners.  Bank and Borrower disclaim any intention to create any partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income between Bank and Borrower or any sharing of liabilities, losses, costs or expenses.</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">FOR VALUE RECEIVED, </B>the undersigned, <B>1<SUP>ST</SUP> FRANKLIN FINANCIAL CORPORATION </B>("Borrower"), a Georgia corporation, promises to pay to the order of <B>SOUTHTRUST BANK </B>("Bank"), at the office of Bank in Atlanta, Georgia, or at such other place as the holder of this Note may from time to time designate in writing, the principal sum of Twenty-One Million and No/l00 Dollars ($21,000,000.00), or so much thereof as may have been advanced to Borrower from time to time and not repaid by Borrower pursuant to the terms hereof, together with interest on the unpaid principal amount of such advances at a per annum in accordance with that certain Loan Agreement (as may be amended or modified from time to time, the "Loan Agreement") dated as of even date hereof between Borrower and Bank so long as the principal amount, or any part thereof, is outstanding.  The principal amount of such advances shall bear interest from the date of each such advance in accordance with the Loan Agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interest provided for herein shall be due and payable monthly in arrears commencing on the 1st day of October, 2001, and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter through and until such time as there remains no unpaid principal balance on the amounts advanced to Borrower hereunder or under the Loan Agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Principal and interest shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America.  Interest on the principal amount shall be calculated on the basis of a 365-day year by multiplying the principal amount by the per annum rate set forth above, multiplying the product thereof by the actual number of days elapsed, and dividing the product so obtained by 365.  The term "Base Rate" means the rate of interest designated by the Bank periodically as its Base Rate.  Borrower understands that the Base Rate merely serves as a basis for calculating rates of interest and is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by the Bank.  The Base Rate on the date of this Note is 6.0%.  Time is of the essence with respect to the amounts due hereunder.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Commitment Period (as defined in the Loan Agreement), Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow the principal sum of this Note, all in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement but only in such amounts and to the extent therein provided.  On September&nbsp;25, 2002 or such earlier date as may be provided in the Loan Agreement (the "Maturity Date"), this Note shall mature and all principal, interest, and other fees and charges due with respect hereto, if not previously paid, shall be immediately due and payable.</P>

<P>This Note may be prepaid as set forth in the Loan Agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Borrower will pay to Bank a late charge equal to three percent (3%) of any payment not received by Bank within fifteen (15) days after the due date thereof.  Collection or acceptance by Bank of such late charge shall not constitute a waiver of any remedies of Bank provided herein.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Note is referred to in and is entitled to the benefits of the Loan Agreement.  Any capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning set forth in the Loan Agreement.  Funds disbursed hereunder shall be disbursed in accordance with the Loan Agreement.  This Note is unconditionally guaranteed by that certain Guaranty Agreement executed by Franklin Securities, Inc. ("Guarantor") bearing even date herewith.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal sum evidenced by this Note, together with accrued but unpaid interest, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date, but in any event at the option of Bank upon the occurrence of any Event of Default under the Loan Agreement.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Upon any default, Borrower agrees to pay interest to Bank (or any holder) at the annual rate of two percent (2%) in excess of the rate otherwise herein provided, as said rate shall change from time to time, on the aggregate indebtedness represented by this Note, including interest earned to maturity, from maturity, whether or not resulting from acceleration, until such aggregate indebtedness is paid in full. The Bank (or any holder) shall be entitled to recover all expenses of collecting this Note, including, without limitation, costs of court and reasonable and actual attorneys' fees.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The acceptance by the Bank of any payment or payments due hereunder, or any part of such payment, after any default shall not constitute a waiver of such default by the Bank.</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>With respect to the amounts due under this Note, Borrower waives the following:</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<OL>

<OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>All rights of exemption of property from levy or sale under execution or other process for the collection of debts under the Constitution or laws of the United States or any state thereof; and</LI></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Demand, presentment, protest, notice of dishonor, notice of non-payment, suit against any party, diligence in collection, and all other requirements necessary to charge or hold the undersigned liable on any obligations hereunder.</LI></P></OL>
</OL>


<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of any provision contained in this Note or any of the Loan Documents, in no event shall the aggregate of all amounts that are contracted for, charged or collected pursuant to the terms of this Note or any of the Loan Documents, and that are deemed interest under Applicable Law, exceed the Maximum Rate.  No provision of this Note or in any of the Loan Documents or the exercise by Bank of any right hereunder or under any Loan Document or the prepayment by Borrower of any of the Obligations or the occurrence of any contingency whatsoever, shall entitle Bank to charge or receive, or to require Borrower to pay, interest or any amounts deemed interest by Applicable Law (such amounts being referred to herein collectively as "Interest") in excess of the Maximum Rate, and all provisions hereof or in any Loan Document which may purport to require Borrower to pay Interest exceeding the Maximum Rate shall be without binding force or effect to the extent only of the excess of Interest over such Maximum Rate.  Any Interest charged or received in excess of the Maximum Rate ("Excess"), shall be conclusively presumed to be the result of an accident and bona fide error, and shall, to the extent received by Bank, at the option of Bank, either be applied to reduce the principal amount of the Obligations or returned to Borrower.  The right to accelerate the maturity of any of the Obligations does not include the right to accelerate unaccrued interest and no such interest will be collected by Bank.  All monies paid to Bank hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents shall be subject to any rebate of unearned interest as and to the extent required by Applicable Law.  By the execution of this Note, Borrower covenants that (i) the credit or return of any Excess shall constitute the acceptance by Borrower of such Excess, and (ii) Borrower shall not seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against Bank, based in whole or in part upon contracting for, charging or receiving any Interest in excess of the Maximum Rate.  For the purpose of determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or received by Bank, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or received from Borrower in connection with this Note shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full term of the Obligations.  Borrower and Bank shall, to the maximum extent permitted under Applicable Law, (i) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense, fee or premium rather than as Interest and (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof.  The provisions of this Section shall be deemed to be incorporated into each Loan Document (whether or not any provision of this Section is referred to therein).</P>

<B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Borrower and Bank hereby waive any right to trial by jury on any claim, counterclaim, setoff, demand, action or cause of action (a) arising out of or in any way pertaining or relating to this Note, the Loan Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other instrument, document or agreement executed or delivered in connection with this Note or (b) in any way connected with or pertaining or related to or incidental to any dealings of the parties hereto with respect to this Note, the Loan Agreement, any Loan Document, or any other instrument, document or agreement executed or delivered in connection herewith or in connection with the transactions related thereto or contemplated thereby or the exercise of either party's rights and remedies thereunder, in all of the foregoing cases whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether sounding in contract, tort or otherwise.  Borrower and Bank agree that either or both of them may file a copy of this paragraph with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive trial by jury, and that any dispute or controversy whatsoever between them shall instead be tried in a court of competent jurisdiction by a judge sitting without a jury.</P>
</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bank shall not by any act, delay, omission, or otherwise be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies, and no waiver of any kind shall be valid unless in writing and signed by the Bank.  All rights and remedies of Bank under the terms of this Note and under applicable statutes or rules of law shall be cumulative and may be exercised successively or concurrently. Borrower agrees that there are no defenses, equities or setoffs in respect to the obligations set forth herein.  The obligations of Borrower hereunder shall be binding upon and enforceable against Borrower's successors and assigns.  The obligations of each person named as Borrower herein shall be joint and several obligations of all such persons.  This Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Georgia without regard to any choice or conflict of law principles.  Any provision in this Note which may be unenforceable or invalid under any law shall be ineffective to the extent of such unenforceability or invalidity without affecting the enforceability or validity of any other provision hereof.  Any notice required to be given shall be deemed given if mailed, postage prepaid, to Borrower at the address set forth in the Loan Agreement.</P>
