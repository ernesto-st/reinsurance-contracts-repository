deemed to be conclusive, final and binding on the parties. Any
disputes regarding the amounts calculated by the Companies

resolving the disputes, together with such documentation as may
be requested by the Independent Accountant. The parties shall
instruct the Independent Accountant to resolve such disputes and
issue a written report with respect thereto within 45&nbsp;days
following its receipt of such documentation. The determination
of the Independent Accountant will, with respect to each item in
dispute, be limited to the range for such item proposed by the
Companies in the Post-Effective Time Accounting or the
Post-Transition Accounting, as applicable, and the
Retrocessionaires in the appropriate Objection Notice. The
decision of the Independent Accountant will be final and binding
on the parties with the same effects as if the issues in dispute
had been resolved by arbitration pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.9
of this Agreement. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accountant will be allocated between the parties in accordance
with the Independent Accountant&#146;s assessment of the merits
of the parties&#146; positions with respect to the matters in
dispute.

5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Pre-Closing Access.</I>
Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, subject
to any applicable law relating to antitrust, employment or
privacy issues, the Companies shall afford to the
Retrocessionaires and their Representatives access, upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to all
contracts, documents and information of or relating to the
assets, liabilities, business, operations and other aspects of
the business related to the Treaties, the Ancillary Agreements
or the Existing Retrocession Agreements. The Companies shall,
and shall cause their respective employees to, cooperate with
the Retrocessionaires and their Representatives in their
investigation of matters relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however,<I> </I>that the
Retrocessionaires&#146; investigation shall be conducted in a
manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal
operations of the Companies. Without limiting any of the terms
thereof, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall govern
the Retrocessionaires&#146; and their Representatives&#146;
obligations with respect to all confidential information made
available to the Retrocessionaires or their Representatives
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.3.

5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Transition Services.</I>
(a)&nbsp;Between the Coinsurance Effective Date and the
Transition Date, the Companies shall continue to service the
Treaties, Existing Retrocession Agreements and Ancillary
Agreements (including without limitation any of such agreements
that have been assigned or novated to either Retrocessionaire)
in a manner consistent with their current practices.

(b)&nbsp;Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days following the end of each
calendar month ending between the Coinsurance Effective Date and
the Transition Date, the Companies will provide to the
Retrocessionaires the information needed by the
Retrocessionaires for reporting the Treaties on the
Retrocessionaires&#146; statutory financial statements. The
report will be in a form mutually agreed upon by the parties.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; color: #000000; background: #ffffff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;From the date of this Agreement to the Transition Date,
the Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Retrocessionaires in preparing to transition the
administration of the Treaties from the Companies to the
Retrocessionaires on the Transition Date.
</DIV>

(d)&nbsp;As consideration for the services provided by the
Companies pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.4 (the
<B>&#147;Company Services&#148;</B>), the Retrocessionaires
shall pay or reimburse the Companies: (i)&nbsp;$30,000&nbsp;per
month, prorated for any portion of a month, for Company Services
provided by the Company, and (ii)&nbsp;for Company Services
provided by third parties not affiliated with either Company, at
the actual costs charged by such third parties, provided that
the provision of such services by a third party (including an
appropriate adjustment of the monthly fee contemplated by
clause&nbsp;(i) above) is approved in advance by the
Retrocessionaires. The Retrocessionaires acknowledge that, while
a reduction in the monthly fee contemplated by clause&nbsp;(i)
above is appropriate in the event any Company Service currently
provided by the Companies (or an affiliate of the Companies) is
moved to a third party, there may be circumstances in which the
aggregate amount paid by the Retrocessionaires for Company
Services may exceed $30,000. For as long as the Companies are
obligated to perform any Company Services, not later than twenty
(20)&nbsp;days following the end of each calendar month, the
Companies shall submit to the Retrocessionaires in writing an
invoice for the Company Services performed by the Companies
during the preceding month that sets forth, in reasonable
detail, costs for services provided by unaffiliated third
parties. The Retrocessionaires shall pay the aggregate amount
shown on each such invoice no later than ten (10)&nbsp;days
after receipt of the invoice, and any monthly payment that is
not so paid shall bear interest from such due date until the
date paid at the Treasury Rate.

5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Continued Access to Books
and Records Transferred to the Retrocessionaires.</I> On and

the Companies with access to all information in the possession
or control of the Retrocessionaires which the Companies
reasonably request in connection with the Treaties relating to
the preparation or examination of the Companies&#146; tax
returns and financial statements, the review of payment and
claims procedures, the adequacy of established reserves, the
compliance by the Retrocessionaires with any obligations they
have under this Agreement or the Coinsurance Agreements, and the
conduct of any litigation or regulatory dispute resolution,

Retrocessionaires during normal business hours of the
Retrocessionaires upon forty-eight (48)&nbsp;hours advance

to facilitate the transfer of the Books and Records on the
Transition Date, the Companies shall cooperate with the
Retrocessionaires and their respective designees in converting
the Books and Records from the Companies&#146; systems to the
Retrocessionaires&#146; systems. Historical treaty, accounting,
claims, policy master file, retrocession and financial and
actuarial information concerning the Treaties, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Existing Retrocession Agreements will be
provided to the Retrocessionaires in formats reasonably
designated thereby with file layouts and mapping documents as
reasonably designated thereby. Any third-party expense incurred
by the Companies in connection with providing any such
information in the formats designated shall be reimbursed by the
Retrocessionaires. The Companies will make appropriate personnel
available to respond to questions from the
Retrocessionaires&#146; systems personnel in order to enable the
Retrocessionaires to understand the data and file layouts and
effectuate a transfer of the Books and Records.

efforts to procure the consent of (i)&nbsp;the relevant Cedent
to the novation of each of the Treaties to the Retrocessionaires
pursuant to a Novation Amendment, (ii)&nbsp;the relevant
retrocessionaire to the execution and delivery of an Existing

Retrocession Agreements, and (iii)&nbsp;the appropriate Person
to the assignment or novation to and assumption by the relevant

each Third-Party Retrocessionaire now assuming any risk as to
such Treaty under an Existing Retrocession Agreement has
executed an Existing Retrocession Agreement Assignment with
respect thereto.

(c)&nbsp;In the event that the Companies and the

a Retrocessionaire, (i)&nbsp;the Companies shall use
commercially reasonable efforts in cooperation with the relevant
Retrocessionaire to (A)&nbsp;provide or cause to be provided to
such Retrocessionaire the benefits of such Ancillary Agreement
and (B)&nbsp;enforce for the benefit of such Retrocessionaire
any rights of either Company arising from such Ancillary
Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;such Retrocessionaire shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to perform the obligations of
the relevant Company under such Ancillary Agreement. If and when
any such required consent to the assignment of an Ancillary
Agreement is obtained, the relevant Company shall promptly

relevant Retrocessionaire without the payment of further
consideration therefore, and such Retrocessionaire shall assume
such rights and obligations.

(e)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Section&nbsp;5.9 to
the contrary, on the Closing Date, each Existing Retrocession
Agreement under which ALR America retrocedes to ALR Bermuda
risks assumed under any of the other Treaties (an
&#147;Inter-Affiliate Agreement&#148;) will be novated in part,
by means of a bifurcation of such Inter-Affiliate Agreement, to
substitute Wilton America for ALR America and Wilton Bermuda for
ALR Bermuda as to each Treaty that is a Novated Treaty on the
Closing Date. Following the Closing Date, at such time as any
Treaty is novated to Wilton America, each Inter-Affiliate
Agreement covering such Treaty will be further novated in part
to substitute Wilton America for ALR America and Wilton Bermuda
for ALR Bermuda as to such Treaty. The documentation effecting
the partial novations contemplated by this Section&nbsp;5.9(e)
shall be in a form reasonably satisfactory to the parties
hereto. Regardless of whether any Treaties have not yet been
novated at the time in question, the Inter-Affiliate Agreements
shall be finally and completely novated to substitute Wilton
America for ALR America and Wilton Bermuda for ALR Bermuda
effective either (i)&nbsp;the last day of the sixth calendar
month following the month in which the Closing Date falls, or
(ii)&nbsp;the last day of such earlier calendar month as the
Retrocessionaires shall elect in their sole discretion.

funds on deposit pursuant to such agreement to be returned to

5.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Letters of Credit or
Similar Collateral.</I> (a)&nbsp;Following the date of this
Agreement, the Companies and the Retrocessionaires will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to arrange to replace any
letters of credit required to be maintained by the Companies
under any Treaty (each, a &#147;Collateralized Treaty&#148;)
with letters of credit provided by the Retrocessionaires, with
such replacement to be effectuated on the Closing Date or as
promptly thereafter as practicable. As to any letters of credit
the Companies continue to maintain following the Closing, the
Retrocessionaire reinsuring the applicable Collateralized Treaty
shall reimburse the applicable Company for (i)&nbsp;all amounts
paid or incurred by such Company for such letter of credit after
the Closing Date (excluding letter of credit facility commitment
fees or other similar amounts not specifically relating to the
letter of credit in question), and, (ii)&nbsp;in the event of
any draw against any such letter of credit securing a
Collateralized Treaty following the Closing Date, including
without limitation a draw resulting from the non-renewal of such
letter of credit, an amount equal to the amount of such draw. If
the Retrocessionaire is obligated to make any payment under
clause&nbsp;(ii) of the preceding sentence, the Company
receiving such payment shall, upon receipt of such payment,
assign to the Retrocessionaire all of its right, title and
interest in and to the return of such collateral under the terms
of the applicable Collateralized Treaty. Any payment to either
Company required pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.10(a) shall be
made to such Company within five (5)&nbsp;days of the
appropriate Retrocessionaire&#146;s receipt of notice of the
event giving rise to such payment, and any payment not so made
to the appropriate Company shall bear interest from such due
date until the date paid at the Treasury Rate.

Companies shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all approvals,
authorizations and clearances of governmental and regulatory
authorities to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Coinsurance Agreements, and shall cooperate
with each other and provide such information and communications
to such governmental and regulatory authorities as the party

The Retrocessionaires and the Companies will provide each other

comment on all such filings with any governmental and regulatory
authorities and will keep each other informed of the status of

It is expressly understood by the parties hereto that each party

the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms or the Closing Date, none of ALR Holdings, the
Companies or any of their respective Representatives shall (and
each of ALR Holdings and the Companies shall cause their
respective Representatives not to), directly or indirectly,
(i)&nbsp;initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, is intended to result in, or could be expected to
lead to any Competing Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or
(ii)&nbsp;engage in negotiations or discussions concerning the
Treaties or any Company with, or provide any confidential
information with respect to the Treaties or any Company to, any
person making or proposing to make any Competing Acquisition
Proposal. Each of ALR Holdings and each Company will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,

heretofore with respect to any Competing Acquisition Proposal,
and will take the necessary steps to promptly inform such
parties of the obligations undertaken in this Section&nbsp;5.20.

(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
the foregoing Section&nbsp;5.20(a), nothing herein shall
prohibit ALR Holdings, prior to the receipt of the approval of
its shareholders of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (as provided for on Schedule&nbsp;3.2), (i)&nbsp;from
complying with Rule&nbsp;14e-2 and Rule&nbsp;14d-9 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with regard to a
bona fide tender offer or exchange offer, or (ii)&nbsp;from
participating in negotiations or discussions with or furnishing
information to any person in connection with an unsolicited bona
fide Competing Acquisition Proposal that is submitted in writing
by such Person to the Board of Directors of ALR Holdings after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the receipt of the
approval of ALR Holdings&#146; shareholders of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided that, prior to
participating in any such discussions or negotiations or
furnishing any information (A)&nbsp;ALR Holdings shall promptly
provide the Retrocessionaires with notice of the receipt of any
communication regarding a potential Competing Acquisition
Proposal, including the identity of the person making or
proposing to make such Competing Acquisition Proposal and the
material terms thereof, (B)&nbsp;ALR Holdings shall have
received from such person an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms not less favorable to ALR Holdings than the
Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided
only for informational purposes to the Retrocessionaires,
(C)&nbsp;the Board of Directors of ALR Holdings shall have
concluded in good faith, after obtaining the advice of its
outside financial advisors, that such Competing Acquisition
Proposal is reasonably likely to be or to result in a Superior
Proposal (as defined below), and (D)&nbsp;the Board of Directors
of ALR Holdings shall have concluded in good faith, after
obtaining the advice of its outside legal advisors, that
participating in such negotiations or discussions or furnishing
such information is required in order for the Board of Directors
of ALR Holdings to fulfill its fiduciary duties to its
shareholders. The Board of Directors of ALR Holdings shall
promptly notify the Retrocessionaires of any material changes or
amendment to the primary terms of such Competing Acquisition
Proposal.

(c)&nbsp;In the event that, prior to the receipt of the approval
of its shareholders of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (as provided for on Schedule&nbsp;3.2), the Board of
Directors of ALR Holdings determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor, that such Competing
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, and that, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to accept
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors of ALR Holdings, the Board of
Directors of ALR Holdings may accept such Superior Proposal and
the Companies may terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section&nbsp;9.1.3(b) of this Agreement; provided, however, that
prior to any such acceptance of the Superior Proposal and
termination of this Agreement, ALR Holdings shall
(i)&nbsp;notify the Retrocessionaires in writing that it intends
to enter into an agreement relating to a Superior Proposal,
which notice shall include the most recent draft of the relevant
acquisition agreement (and which

notice shall give the Retrocessionaires the immediate right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section&nbsp;9.1.2(b) of this Agreement), (ii)&nbsp;during the
five Business Days following receipt by the Retrocessionaires of
such notice, ALR Holdings shall have offered the
Retrocessionaires the opportunity to make such adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that any
Competing Acquisition Proposal is no longer a Superior Proposal,
and (iii)&nbsp;the Board of Directors of ALR Holdings shall have
concluded, after termination of the five Business Day period,
that the Competing Acquisition Proposal giving rise to ALR
Holdings&#146; obligations to provide notice hereunder continues
to be a Superior Proposal. ALR Holdings and the Companies may
not terminate this Agreement under Section&nbsp;9.1.3(b) in
connection with a Superior Proposal unless ALR Holdings pays to
the Retrocessionaires in immediately available funds the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section&nbsp;9.2 of this Agreement.
ALR Holdings agrees that it will not enter into a binding
agreement relating to a Superior Proposal until at least the
sixth Business Day after it has provided the notice to the
Retrocessionaires described above. ALR Holdings further agrees
that it shall notify the Retrocessionaires promptly if ALR
Holdings has changed its intention with respect to entering into
the agreement identified in the notice provided hereunder,
whether as a result of the Retrocessionaires modifying their
offer or otherwise.

(d)&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Competing
Acquisition Proposal&#148; means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person relating to (x)&nbsp;any direct or indirect
sale, transfer, pledge, disposition, reinsurance, novation, bulk
reinsurance or other conveyance of rights or interests with
respect to the Treaties other than a transaction expressly
provided for herein, (y)&nbsp;a direct or indirect sale of any
of the outstanding shares of, or other securities issued by,
either Company or ALR Holdings or (z)&nbsp;a merger,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, share
exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving any Company other than a transaction
expressly provided for herein; provided, however, that any such
inquiry, proposal or offer that relates to a transaction that
would, by its terms, be consummated following the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not be
considered a Competing Acquisition Proposal so long as such
transaction would not interfere with the Retrocessionaires&#146;
rights hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Superior
Proposal&#148; means any Competing Acquisition Proposal with
respect to which any required financing is committed or, in the
good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of ALR Holdings,
based on the advice of its outside financial advisors, is
reasonably capable of being financed by the person making the
proposal and, with respect to which the Board of Directors of
ALR Holdings shall have concluded in good faith is reasonably
capable of being completed, taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the Competing
Acquisition Proposal and the person making the proposal, and
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to
ALR Holding&#146;s shareholders from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Notice of Claim.</I> As soon
as reasonably practicable, but in no event subsequent to the
first to occur of the expiration of the relevant survival period
of a representation or warranty (as set forth in
Article&nbsp;VII) or thirty (30)&nbsp;days after receipt by an
indemnified party hereunder of written notice of any demand,
claim or circumstances which, upon the lapse of time, would give
rise to a claim or the commencement (or threatened commencement)
of any action, proceeding or investigation (a &#147;Claim&#148;)
that may result in a Loss, such indemnified party shall give
notice thereof (&#147;Claims Notice&#148;) to the indemnifying
party. The Claims Notice shall describe the Claim in reasonable
detail, and shall indicate the amount (if quantifiable and
estimated, if necessary) of the Loss that has been or may be
suffered by such indemnified party. The failure of the
indemnified party to give the Claims Notice within in the time
provided for herein shall not affect the indemnifying
party&#146;s obligation under this Article&nbsp;VIII except if,
and then only to the extent that, such failure prejudices the
indemnifying party or its ability to defend such Claim.

8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Opportunity to Defend.</I>
Within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt of any Claims Notice
given pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.4, the indemnifying party shall
notify the indemnified party in writing of the acceptance of or
objection to the Claim and whether the indemnifying party will
indemnify the indemnified party and, in the case of a Claim by a
third party, defend the same at the expense of the indemnifying
party with counsel selected by the indemnifying party (who shall
be approved in writing by the indemnified party, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld); provided that the indemnified
party shall at all times have the right to fully participate in
the defense of any third-party Claim at its own expense or, as
provided herein below, at the expense of the indemnifying party.
Failure by the indemnifying party to object in writing within
such thirty (30)&nbsp;day period shall be deemed to be
acceptance of the Claim by the indemnifying party. In the event
that the indemnifying party objects to a third-party Claim
within said thirty (30)&nbsp;day period or does not object but
fails to vigorously defend and appears to be unable or unwilling
to meet its indemnification obligations hereunder, the
indemnified party shall have the right, but not the obligation,
to undertake the defense, and to compromise and/or settle (in
the exercise of reasonable business judgment) such Claim. Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, the indemnified party
shall not compromise and/or settle any third-party Claim without
the prior written consent of the indemnifying party. If a
third-party Claim is one that cannot by its nature be defended
solely by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party shall
make available all information and assistance that the
indemnifying party may reasonably request, provided that any
associated expense shall be paid by the indemnifying party.

remedies provided in this Article&nbsp;VIII shall be the
exclusive remedies available to the Company Indemnified Parties
and the Retrocessionaire Indemnified Parties with respect to any
breach of representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation
under this Agreement or any document or instrument delivered
under this Agreement (other than the Coinsurance Agreement, any
Novation Amendment, Existing Retrocession Agreement Assignment

of, resulting from or related to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Neither party shall be entitled to
indemnification unless the party seeking indemnification makes
claim therefor pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section&nbsp;8.4 of this Agreement. In addition, for purposes of
determining any indemnifiable amount under this Agreement or the
agreements contemplated hereby, the amount of a Loss shall be
reduced by any net tax benefit to the indemnified party from the
Loss and any insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or
similar payments recoverable by the indemnified party from any
third party with respect to the Loss. Except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement with respect to any
Company Extracontractual Liability or Retrocessionaire
Extracontractual Liability, in no event shall the indemnifying
party under this Article&nbsp;VIII have liability to the
indemnified party for any consequential, special, incidental,
indirect, or punitive damages, lost revenue, profits or income,
diminution in value, loss of business reputation or opportunity
or similar items; provided, that the term &#147;Loss&#148; shall

Agreements.

such court. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court and any claim
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party
hereto agrees that final judgment in any such action, suit or
proceeding brought in any such court shall be conclusive and
binding upon such party and may be enforced in any other courts
to whose jurisdiction such party may be subject, by suit upon
such judgment.

(b)&nbsp;The parties intend this Section&nbsp;10.9 to be
enforceable in accordance with the United States Federal

amendments to that Act which are subsequently adopted. In the

provision of this Agreement other than any provision of
Article&nbsp;II, Article&nbsp;III or Article&nbsp;VIII is held
to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or
future law or is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be unenforceable, and if the rights or obligations of the

provision had never comprised a part of this Agreement, and the
remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and will not be affected by the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance herefrom.

2.01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Reinsurance Premiums.</I>
(a)&nbsp;In connection with the Closing under the Master
Agreement, in order to effect the reinsurance on the Covered
Treaties at the Effective Time, the Company has paid to the
Retrocessionaire an initial reinsurance premium equal to [insert
allocable portion of Master Agreement consideration].
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; color: #000000; background: #ffffff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b)&nbsp;The Retrocessionaire shall be entitled to receive, as
additional reinsurance premium, immediate payment of an amount
equal to (i)&nbsp;Premiums received on and after the Effective
Time attributable to the Covered Treaties less
(ii)&nbsp;Premiums paid by the Company to Third-Party
Retrocessionaires under any Existing Retrocession Agreements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; margin-bottom: 0; color: #000000; background: #ffffff;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c)&nbsp;To the extent that the Company recovers amounts from
any third party relating to the Covered Treaties (including,
without limitation, Premiums from any Ceding Company and
litigation recoveries, but excluding recoveries under Existing
Retrocession Agreements that have not been assigned or novated
to Retrocessionaire), immediately upon receipt of any such
amounts the Company shall transfer such amounts to the
Retrocessionaire and provide the Retrocessionaire with any
pertinent information that the Company may have relating thereto.

(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
Section&nbsp;2.01(b) and (c)&nbsp;of this Agreement, any amounts
paid, received or due by the Company thereunder prior to the
Transition Date shall be accounted for and paid pursuant to
Section&nbsp;5.3(b) and (c)&nbsp;of the Master Agreement.

2.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Delayed Payments.</I> If
there is a delayed settlement of any payment due hereunder,
interest will accrue on such payment on a daily compounded basis
at an annual rate equal to the Treasury Rate. For purposes of
this Section&nbsp;2.02, a payment will be considered overdue,
and such interest will begin to accrue, on the first day
immediately following the date such payment is due. For greater
clarity, (i)&nbsp;a payment shall be deemed to be due hereunder
on the last date on which such payment may be timely made under
the applicable provision, and (ii)&nbsp;interest will not accrue
on any payment due the Retrocessionaire hereunder unless the
delayed settlement thereof was caused by the Company.

2.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Failure to Pay Reinsurance
Premiums.</I> The payment of reinsurance premiums is a condition
precedent to the continuing liability of the Retrocessionaire
under this Agreement, unless such failure is a result of any
action or inaction of the Retrocessionaire or any of its
Representatives during the time it is administering the Covered
Treaties pursuant to Article&nbsp;III of this Agreement. If
reinsurance premiums with respect to this Agreement are not paid
when due, the Retrocessionaire shall have the right to provide
the Company 45&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice (the
&#147;Initial Notice&#148;) of its intent to terminate because
of the Company&#146;s failure to pay reinsurance premiums. If
such reinsurance premiums have not been paid within 45&nbsp;days
of the delivery of the Initial Notice, the Retrocessionaire
shall provide to the Company a second notice (the &#147;Second
Notice&#148;) of its intent to terminate because of the
Company&#146;s failure to pay such premiums. The reinsurance
hereunder of all Covered Treaties shall terminate as of the last
date upon which premiums with respect to such Covered Treaties
were paid.

promptly to review (which review shall commence no later than
five (5) days after the selection of such independent

Such independent accountants shall deliver to Retrocessionaire

thirty (30)&nbsp;days after the commencement of their review), a
report setting forth such calculation, which calculation shall
result in a net consideration between the amount thereof shown
in the Company&#146;s calculation delivered and the amount
thereof shown in Retrocessionaire&#146;s calculation. Such
report shall be final and binding upon Retrocessionaire and the
Company. The fees, costs and expenses of such independent
accountant shall be borne (i)&nbsp;by the Company if the
difference between the net consideration as calculated by the
independent accountants and the Company&#146;s calculation is
greater than the difference between the net consideration as
calculated by the independent accountants and
Retrocessionaire&#146;s calculation, (ii)&nbsp;by the
Retrocessionaire if the first such difference is less than the
second such difference, and (iii)&nbsp;otherwise equally by
Retrocessionaire and the Company.
