<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan is to attract,
retain and motivate officers, directors, employees (including prospective employees), consultants
and others who may perform services for the Firm (as hereinafter defined), to compensate them for
their contributions to the long-term growth and profits of the Firm and to encourage them to
acquire a proprietary interest in the success of the Firm.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan was originally adopted by the Board of Directors of GS Inc. on April&nbsp;30, 1999 as The
Goldman Sachs 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the &#147;1999 SIP&#148;) and was amended and restated by the Board
on January&nbsp;16, 2003, subject to the approval by the shareholders of GS Inc. Such shareholder
approval was obtained on April&nbsp;1, 2003. The Plan was further amended and restated, effective as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments made to the 1999 SIP shall affect only Awards granted on or after the
&#147;Effective Date&#148; (as hereinafter defined). Awards granted prior to the Effective Date shall be
governed by the terms of the 1999 SIP and Award Agreements as in effect prior to the Effective
Date. The terms of this Plan are not intended to affect the interpretation of the terms of the
1999 SIP as they existed prior to the Effective Date.
