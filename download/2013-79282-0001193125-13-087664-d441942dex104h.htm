Employee&#146;s employment with Company. For purposes of this Agreement, Employee acknowledges that informing existing clients or prospects that Employee is or may be leaving Company prior to

of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this <B>Section&nbsp;8</B>, Company shall be entitled to injunctive relief as well as any other applicable remedies at law or in equity. Employee understands and agrees that without such

the purposes of this <B>Section&nbsp;8</B> would be frustrated by measuring the period of restriction from the date of termination of employment where the Employee failed to honor the Agreement until directed to do so by court order. </FONT></P>

employment with the Company for any reason (whether voluntary or involuntary), directly or indirectly solicit or seek to induce any of the Company&#146;s employees to leave the Company&#146;s employ for any reason, including, without limitation, to
work for Employee or any other competitive company. Employee acknowledges and agrees that all activities under this <B>Section&nbsp;9</B> shall be presumed to be in aid of prohibited solicitation under the terms of <B>Section&nbsp;8</B> of this
Agreement, and shall justify injunctive relief as provided in <B>Section&nbsp;8</B>. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">10. <U>Protection of Company
