<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">(a) Revolving Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Lender agrees to make revolving loans (&#8220;Revolving Loans&#8221;) in Dollars to the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Revolving Commitment; provided that after giving effect to the making of any Revolving Loan, the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Commitment. The Revolving Loans may consist of Base Rate Loans or Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans (each, a &#8220;Type&#8221; of Revolving Loan), or a combination thereof, as the Borrower may request. Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1(a) may be repaid without premium or penalty (subject to Section 3.1(c)) and, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, re- borrowedre-borrowed during the Revolving Commitment Period. (b) [Reserved]. (c) Mechanics for Revolving Loans. (i) All Revolving Loans shall be made in an aggregate minimum principal amount of Five-Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and integral multiples of One-Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof. (ii) The Borrower shall request a Revolving Loan by delivering to the Lender a fully executed Funding Notice no later than (x) 2:00 p.m. on the date that is at least three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the proposed Credit Date in the case of an Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan and (y) 2:00 p.m. on the date that is at least one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed Credit Date in the case of a Base Rate Loan. Except as otherwise provided herein, any Funding Notice in respect of an Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and the Borrower shall be bound to make a borrowing in accordance therewith. (iii) Upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent specified herein (including, without limitation, Section 5.2(d)), the Lender shall make the proceeds of the requested Credit Extension available to the Borrower on the applicable Credit Date by crediting the account of the Borrower at the Lender or such other account as may be designated in writing to the Lender by the Borrower and approved by the Lender. Section 2.2 [Reserved]. Section 2.3 Evidence of Debt; Lender&#8217;s Books and Records; Note. (a) Lender&#8217;s Evidence of Debt. The Lender shall maintain on its internal records an account or accounts evidencing the Obligations, including the amounts of the Revolving Loans made by it and each repayment and prepayment in respect thereof. Any such recordation shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower, absent manifest error; provided, that the failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall not affect the Obligations. (b) Note. The Borrower shall execute and deliver to the Lender a Note to evidence the Revolving Loans. Section 2.4 Scheduled Principal Payments. The principal amount of Revolving Loans shall be due and payable in full on the Maturity Date. Section 2.5 Interest on Revolving Loans. 30 LEGAL02/44107030v1 (a) Except as otherwise set forth herein, each Revolving Loan shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof from, and including, the date made to, and including, the date of repayment thereof as follows: (i) if a Base Rate Loan, the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin; or (ii) if an Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan, the Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR plus the Applicable Margin. (b) The basis for determining the rate of interest with respect to any Revolving Loan, and the Interest Period with respect to any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan, shall be selected by the Borrower pursuant to the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, as the case may be. If on any day a Revolving Loan is outstanding with respect to which a Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice has not been delivered to the Lender in accordance with the terms hereof specifying the applicable basis for determining the rate of interest, then for that day (i) if such Revolving Loan is an Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan, such Revolving Loan shall become a Base Rate Loan and (ii) if such Revolving Loan is a Base Rate Loan, such Revolving Loan shall remain a Base Rate Loan. (c) In connection with Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans, there shall be no more than six (6) Interest Periods outstanding at any time. In the event the Borrower fails to specify an Interest Period for any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan in the applicable Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month.  As soon as practicable after 10:00 a.m10:00 a.m. on each Interest Rate Determination Date and each Index Rate Determination Date, the Lender shall determine (which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final, conclusive and binding upon the Borrower) the interest rate that shall apply to each LIBOR Loanof the Adjusted Term SOFR Loans for which an interest rate is then being determined (and for the applicable Interest Period in the case of Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans) and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower. (d) Interest payable pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be computed on the basis of (i) for interest at the Base Rate (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to the LIBO Index Rate), a year of three hundred sixty-five (365) or three hundred sixty-six (366) days, as the case may be, and (ii) for all other computations of fees and interest, a year of three hundred sixty (360) days, in each case for the actual number of days elapsed in the period during which it accrues. In computing interest on any Revolving Loan, the date of the making of such Revolving Loan or the first day of an Interest Period applicable to such Revolving Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted from a SOFR Loan, the date of conversion of such SOFR Loan to such Base Rate Loan, as the case may be, shall be included, and the date of payment of such Revolving Loan or the expiration date of an Interest Period applicable to such Revolving Loan or, with respect to a Base Rate Loan being converted to a SOFR Loan, the date of conversion of such Base Rate Loan to such SOFR Loan, as the case may be, shall be excluded; provided, that, if a Revolving Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one (1) day&#8217;s interest shall be paid on that Revolving Loan. (e) If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lender determines that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Lender promptly on demand by the Lender (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under Debtor Relief Laws, automatically and without further action by the Lender) an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This subsection (e) shall not limit the rights of 31 LEGAL02/44107030v1 the Lender under any other provision of this Agreement. The Borrower&#8217;s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations. (f) Except as otherwise set forth herein, interest on each Revolving Loan shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be payable in arrears on and to (i) each Interest Payment Date applicable to that Revolving Loan; (ii) upon any prepayment of that Revolving Loan (other than a voluntary prepayment of a Revolving Loan which interest shall be payable in accordance with clause (i) above), to the extent accrued on the amount being prepaid; and (iii) at maturity, including on the Maturity Date. Section 2.6 Conversion/Continuation. (a) The Borrower shall have the option, subject to Section 3.1(c) in the case of the conversion of an Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan, prior to the end of the applicable Interest Period: (i) to convert at any time all or any part of any Revolving Loan in a principal amount equal to One-Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) and integral multiples of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in excess thereof, from one Type of Revolving Loan to another Type of Revolving Loan, or (ii) upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan, to continue all or any portion of such Revolving Loan as an Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan. (b) The Borrower shall deliver a Conversion/Continuation Notice to the Lender no later than 2:00 p.m. on the date that is at least three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date. Except as otherwise provided herein, a Conversion/Continuation Notice for conversion to, or continuation of, any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans (or telephonic notice in lieu thereof) shall be irrevocable on and after the related Interest Rate Determination Date, and the Borrower shall be bound to effect a conversion or continuation in accordance therewith. Section 2.7 Default Rate of Interest. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default (other than a Specified Acceleration Event of Default), the Borrower shall, at the request of the Lender, pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Specified Acceleration Event of Default, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (b) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. (c) In the case of any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan, upon the expiration of the Interest Period in effect at the time the Default Rate is effective, each such Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loan shall thereupon become a Base Rate Loan and shall thereafter bear interest at the Default Rate then in effect for Base Rate Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of interest provided for in this Section 2.7 is not a permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of the Lender. Section 2.8 Fees. (a) Upfront Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender an upfront fee (the &#8220;Upfront Fee&#8221;) in an amount equal to seventy-five basis points (0.75%) of the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the 32 LEGAL02/44107030v1 Revolving Commitment on the Closing Date. The Upfront Fee will be due and payable by the Borrower on the Closing Date. (b) Commitment Fee.

In Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Credit Document (and any Swap Agreement shall be deemed not to be a &#8220;Credit Document&#8221; for purposes of this Section 3.1), in the event that the Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto) that (i) by reason of circumstances affecting the London or other applicable interbank market, on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect to any Adjusted Term SOFR Loans, that (i) adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining theSOFR, Term SOFR, Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR or the LIBO Index Rate, as applicable, or (ii) theSOFR, Term SOFR, Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR or the LIBO Index Rate, as applicable, for any proposed LIBOR LoanAdjusted Term SOFR Loans does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lender of funding or maintaining such LIBORAdjusted Term SOFR Loan, the Lender shall give notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower of such determination, whereupon (x) no Revolving Loans may be made as, or converted to, LIBORAdjusted Term SOFR Loans until such time as the Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, and (y) any Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice given by the Borrower with respect to the Revolving Loans in respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by the Borrower and (z) all such Revolving Loans described in clause (y) hereof shall be automatically made or continued as, or converted to, as applicable, Base Rate Loans on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto without reference to the LIBO Index Rate component of the Base Rate., unless the Borrower prepays such Revolving Loans in accordance with this Agreement. If the circumstances described in this Section 3.1(a) occur but only with respect to limited, but not all, tenors of the then applicable term rate Benchmark (including Term SOFR), then (A) the Lender may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such illegal or impracticable tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) of this sentence is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark, then the Lender may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (b) Illegality or Impracticability of the Benchmark. (i) (b) Illegality or Impracticability of LIBOR Loans. InSubject to Section 3.1(b)(ii), in the event that on any date the Lender shall have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but shall be made only after notice to and consultation with the Borrower) that the making, maintaining or continuation of its LIBOR Loans (i) has become unlawful as a result of compliance by the Lender in good faith with any law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order (or would conflict with any such treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order not having the force of law even though the failure to comply therewith would not be unlawful), or (ii) has become impracticable, as a result of contingencies occurring after the Closing Date which materially and adversely affect the London interbank market or the position of the Lender in that market, then, and in any such eventa Benchmark Illegality/Impracticability Event has occurred, the Lender shall on that day give notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Borrower of such determination.  Thereafter (1) the obligation of the Lender to make Revolving Loans as, or to convert Revolving Loans to, LIBORAdjusted Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended until such 35 LEGAL02/44107030v1 notice shall be withdrawn by the Lender, (2) to the extent such determination by the Lender relates to a LIBORan Adjusted Term SOFR Loan then being requested by the Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Lender shall make such Revolving Loan as (or continue such Revolving Loan as or convert such Revolving Loan to, as the case may be) a Base Rate Loan (without reference to the LIBO Index Rate (or other then-current Benchmark) component of the Base Rate), (3) the Lender&#8217;s obligation to maintain its outstanding LIBORAdjusted Term SOFR Loans (the &#8220;Affected Loans&#8221;) shall be terminated at the earlier to occur of the expiration of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the Affected Loans or when required by Applicable Law, and (4) the Affected Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans without reference to the LIBO Index Rate (or other then-current Benchmark) component of the Base Rate on the date of such termination.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a determination by an Lender as described above relates to an Adjusted Term SOFR Loan then being requested by the Borrower pursuant to a Funding Notice or a Conversion/Continuation Notice, the Borrower shall have the option, subject to the provisions of Section 3.1(a), to rescind such Funding Notice or Conversion/Continuation Notice by giving notice (by facsimile or by telephone confirmed in writing) to the Lender of such rescission on the date on which the Lender gives notice of its determination as described above.  Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Section 3.1(b)(i) shall affect the obligation of the Lender other than a Lender to make or maintain Revolving Loans as, or to convert Revolving Loans to, Adjusted Term SOFR Loans in accordance with the terms hereof. If a Benchmark Illegality/Impracticability Event occurs but only with respect to limited, but not all, tenors of the then applicable term rate Benchmark (including Term SOFR), then (x) the Lender may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such illegal or impracticable tenor and (y) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (x) of this sentence is not, or is no longer, subject to a Benchmark Illegality/Impracticability Event, then the Lender may modify the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221; (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, if the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that a Benchmark Illegality/Impracticability Event has occurred, then, on a date and time determined by the Lender (any such date, the &#8220;Benchmark Replacement Date&#8221;), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant Interest Payment Date, as applicable, for interest calculated, the then current Benchmark will be replaced hereunder and under any other Credit Document with the Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, (x) if the Lender determines that the non-Term SOFR alternatives set forth in the definition of Benchmark Replacement is available on or prior to the Benchmark Replacement Date or (y) a Benchmark Illegality/Impracticability Event has occurred with respect to the non-Term SOFR Benchmark Replacement then in effect, then in each case, the Lender and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing Term SOFR or any then current Benchmark Replacement in accordance with this Section 3.1 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant Interest Payment Date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated bilateral credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including Benchmark Replacement Adjustment giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated bilateral credit facilities for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such Benchmark Replacement Adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by 36 LEGAL02/44107030v1 the Lender from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance of doubt, any such proposed rate and Benchmark Replacement Adjustment shall constitute a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date the Lender and the Borrower shall executed such amendment. The Lender will notify (in one or more notices) the Borrower of the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement. Any Benchmark Replacement shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Lender, such Benchmark Replacement shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Lender. Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Credit Document, if at any time any Benchmark Replacement as so determined would otherwise be less than zero percent (0%), the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be zero percent (0%) for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Lender will have the right (following consultation with the Borrower) to make Benchmark Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Credit Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided, that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Lender shall post each such amendment implementing such Benchmark Conforming Changes to the Borrower reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Lender pursuant to this Section 3.1(b)(ii), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 3.1(b)(ii). (c) Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods. The Borrower shall compensate the Lender, promptly upon written request by the Lender (which request shall set forth the basis for requesting such amounts), for all reasonable out-of-pocket losses, expenses and liabilities (including any interest paid or calculated to be due and payable by the Lender to lenders of funds borrowed by it to make or carry its Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans and any loss, expense or liability sustained by the Lender in connection with the liquidation or re-employment of such funds but excluding loss of anticipated profits) which the Lender sustains: (i) if for any reason (other than a default by the Lender) a borrowing of any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Funding Notice or a telephonic request for borrowing, or a conversion to or continuation of any Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans does not occur on a date specified therefor in a Conversion/Continuation Notice or a telephonic request for conversion or continuation; (ii) if any prepayment or other principal payment of, or any conversion of, anany of its Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans occurs on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to that Revolving Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or (iii) if any 37 LEGAL02/44107030v1 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">prepayment of anany of its Adjusted LIBO RateTerm SOFR Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the Borrower. (d) Booking of Adjusted SOFR Loans. The Lender may make, carry or transfer Adjusted Term SOFR Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of the Lender. (e) Certificates for Reimbursement.  A certificate of the Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate the Lender and the circumstances giving rise thereto shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. In the absence of any such manifest error, the Borrower shall pay the Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate promptly and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof. (f) Delay in Requests.  The Borrower shall not be required to compensate athe Lender pursuant to this Section 3.1(c)  for any such amounts incurred more than six (6) months prior to the date that suchthe Lender delivers to the Borrower the certificate referenced abovein Section 3.1(e). (d) Booking of LIBOR Loans. The Lender may make, carry or transfer LIBOR Loans at, to, or for the account of any of its branch offices or the office of an Affiliate of the Lender. (e) Assumptions Concerning Funding of Adjusted LIBO Rate Loans. Calculation of all amounts payable to the Lender under this Section 3.1 and under Section 3.2 shall be made as though the Lender had actually funded each of the relevant Adjusted LIBO Rate Loans through the purchase of a LIBOR deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of Adjusted LIBO Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such Adjusted LIBO Rate Loans and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period and through the transfer of such LIBOR deposit from an offshore office of the Lender to a domestic office of the Lender in the United States; provided, however, that the Lender may fund each of its Adjusted LIBO Rate Loans in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of calculating amounts payable under this Section 3.1 and under Section 3.2. (f) LIBOR Phase Out Disclosure. The United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) has announced it will phase out its support of LIBOR. LIBOR may be sustained until the end of 2021. The Borrower acknowledges that if, during the term of this Agreement, the Lender determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that LIBOR is unavailable, cannot be determined, does not adequately reflect the cost to the Lender of making, funding, or maintaining the Revolving Loans, has become impracticable or unreliable for use, is no longer representative of the underlying market or economic reality, or cannot be lawfully used, the Borrower&#8217;s variable interest rate will be determined based on an alternate interest rate index subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The effect of the FCA&#8217;s decision to no longer support LIBOR cannot be predicted, or, if changes are ultimately made to LIBOR, the effect of those changes cannot be predicted. In addition, the Borrower acknowledges the impact of any interest rate index change related to the Revolving Loans due to the FCA&#8217;s decision to phase out its support of LIBOR, should this occur, cannot be predicted and may or may not be advantageous to the Borrower. Section 3.2 Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally. The Borrower will pay the Lender, promptly on demand, for the Lender&#8217;s costs or losses arising from any Change in Law which are allocated to this Agreement, any Credit Document or any credit outstanding under or arising in connection with this Agreement and/or any 38 LEGAL02/44107030v1 other Credit Document. The allocation will be made as determined by the Lender, using any reasonable method. The costs include, without limitation, the following: (i) any reserve or deposit requirements; and (ii) any capital or liquidity ratios or requirements relating to the Lender&#8217;s assets and commitments for credit. (b) Reserves on LIBOR Loans. The Borrower shall pay to the Lender, as long as the Lender shall be required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as &#8220;Eurocurrency liabilities&#8221;), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Revolving Loan by the Lender (as determined by the Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive and binding), which shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such Revolving Loan. (b) (c) Delay. Failure or delay on the part of the Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2 shall not constitute a waiver of suchthe Lender&#8217;s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate the Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.2 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that the Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of the Lender&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six (6) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). Section 4. GUARANTY Section 4.1 The Guaranty. Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the Lender and the other holders of the Obligations as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt payment of the Obligations in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof. The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Obligations are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same, without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any of the Obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, in any other Credit Document, any other document relating to the Obligations, the obligations of each Guarantor under the Credit Documents shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render such obligations subject to avoidance under the Debtor Relief Laws.

Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, which shall remain absolute and unconditional as described above: (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be waived; (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any Credit Document or any other document relating to the Obligations, shall be done or omitted; (c) the maturity of any of the Obligations shall be accelerated, or any of the Obligations shall be modified, supplemented and/or amended in any respect, or any right under any Credit Document or any other document relating to the Obligations, shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired and/or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with; (d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Lender as security for any of the Obligations shall fail to attach or be perfected; or (e) any of the Obligations shall be determined to be void or voidable (including for the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including any creditor of any Guarantor). With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that the Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents or any other document relating to the Obligations against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Obligations. Section 4.3 Reinstatement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Lender promptly on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees, charges and disbursements of counsel) incurred by the Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any Debtor Relief Laws. 40 LEGAL02/44107030v1 Section 4.4 Certain Additional Waivers. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse to security for the Obligations, except through the exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6. Section 4.5 Remedies. The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, as between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Lender, on the other hand, the Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2) for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person) shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents and that the Lender may exercise its remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof. Section 4.6 Rights of Contribution. The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other Guarantors as permitted under Applicable Law. Such contribution rights shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the obligations of such Guarantors under the Credit Documents and no Guarantor shall exercise such rights of contribution until all Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments have expired or been terminated. Section 4.7 Guarantee of Payment; Continuing Guarantee. The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising. Section 4.8 Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each Specified Credit Party to honor all of such Specified Credit Party&#8217;s obligations under the Guaranty and the Collateral Documents in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section 4.8 for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering such Qualified ECP Guarantor&#8217;s obligations and undertakings under this Section 4, voidable under applicable Debtor Relief Laws, and not for any greater amount). The obligations and undertakings of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section 4.8 shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitments have expired or terminated. Each Qualified ECP Guarantor intends that this Section 4.8 constitute, and this Section 4.8 shall be deemed to constitute, a &#8220;keepwell, support, or other agreement&#8221; for the benefit of each Specified Credit Party for all purposes of section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act. 41 LEGAL02/44107030v1 </FONT></DIV>

(b) Indemnification by the Credit Parties. The Credit Parties, on a joint and several basis, shall indemnify the Lender and each Related Party of the Lender (each such Person an &#8220;Indemnitee&#8221;) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (which, in the case of legal counsel, shall be limited to the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of one primary counsel for the Indemnitees, taken as a whole, and of one special and local counsel to the Indemnitees, taken as a whole, in each applicable jurisdiction retained by the Lender), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (including, without limitation, any Credit Party or Subsidiary) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, (i) the execution or delivery by any Credit Document of any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) any Revolving Loan, or the use, or proposed use, of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by any Credit Party or Subsidiary, or any Environmental Liability, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by any Credit Party or Subsidiary, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided, that, such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, in a final and non-appealable judgment, to have directly and proximately resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of 64 LEGAL02/44107030v1 such Indemnitee and its officers, directors and employees or from a material breach by such Indemnitee of its obligations under this Agreement. (c) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, none of the Credit Parties shall assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, any Credit Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the transactions contemplated thereby, any Revolving Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

Section 10.3 Set-Off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Lender and each of its respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by the Lender or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of such Credit Party now or hereafter existing under any Credit Document to the Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not the Lender or such Affiliate shall have made any demand under any Credit Document and although such obligations of such Credit Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of the Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The rights of the Lender and its Affiliates under this Section 10.3 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Lender or its Affiliates may have. The Lender agrees to notify the Borrower promptly after any such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, participants of the Lender and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Lender) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement. 65 LEGAL02/44107030v1 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">(b) The Borrower understands that the Lender may from time to time enter into a participation agreement or agreements with one or more participants pursuant to which each such participant shall be given a participation in the Revolving Loan and that any such participant may from time to time similarly grant to one or more subparticipants subparticipations in the Revolving Loans; provided that (i) the Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the Lender shall remain solely responsible to the Credit Parties for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrower and the Lender shall continue to deal solely and directly with each other in connection with the Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the above, the Borrower agrees that any participant or subparticipant may exercise any and all rights of banker&#8217;s lien or set-off with respect to the Borrower, as fully as if such participant or subparticipant had made a loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of the participation or subparticipation given to such participant or subparticipant in the Revolving Loans. For the purposes of this Section 10.5(b) only, the Borrower shall be deemed to be directly obligated to each participant or subparticipant in the amount of its participation interest in the amount of the principal of, and interest on, the Revolving Loans. Nothing contained in this Section 10.5(b) shall affect the Lender&#8217;s right of set-off (under Section 10.3 or Applicable Law) with respect to the entire amount of the Revolving Loans, notwithstanding any such participation or subparticipation. The Lender may divulge to any participant or subparticipant all information, reports, financial statements, certificates and documents obtained by it from the Borrower or any other Person under any provision of the Agreement or otherwise. Section 10.6 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. All representations, warranties and agreements made herein shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and the making of any Credit Extension. Notwithstanding anything herein or implied by Applicable Law to the contrary, the agreements of each Credit Party set forth in Section 2.11, Section 3.1(c), Section 3.2, Section 10.2, Section 10.3, and Section 10.10 shall survive the payment of the Revolving Loans, and the termination hereof. Section 10.7 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part of the Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege under any Credit Document shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right or privilege. The rights, powers and remedies given to the Lender hereby are cumulative and shall be in addition to and independent of all rights, powers and remedies existing by virtue of any statute or rule of law or in any of the other Credit Documents or in any Swap Agreements or any Treasury Management Agreements with the Lender or an Affiliate of the Lender. Section 10.8 Marshalling; Payments Set Aside. The Lender shall not be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Credit Party, or any other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any Credit Party makes a payment or payments to the Lender, or the Lender enforces any security interests or exercise its rights of setoff, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or setoff or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any Debtor Relief Law, any other state or federal law, common law or any equitable cause, then, to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied, and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor or related thereto, shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment or payments had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred. Section 10.9 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation under any other Credit Document shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. 66 LEGAL02/44107030v1 Section 10.10 Applicable Laws. (a) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of New York. (b) Submission to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property and/or assets, to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State court, or, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment, or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document against any Credit Party, or any of its properties and/or assets, in the courts of any jurisdiction. (c) Waiver of Venue. Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document in any court referred to in subsection (b) of this Section 10.10. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. (d) Service of Process. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.1. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. Section 10.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.11. Section 10.12 Usury Savings Clause. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, the aggregate interest rate charged, or agreed to be paid, with respect to any of the Obligations, including, without limitation, all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under Applicable Laws, shall not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate, and, in the event any such excess payment is made by the Borrower or received by the Lender, such excess shall be credited to the payment of principal. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Lender exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws: (a) characterize 67 LEGAL02/44107030v1 any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest; (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof; and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest, throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. Section 10.13 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other Credit Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 5, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Lender and when the Lender shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means (e.g. &#8220;pdf&#8221; or &#8220;tif&#8221; format) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. Section 10.14 No Advisory or Fiduciary Relationship. The relationship between the Lender, on one hand, and the Credit Parties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor. Neither Lender nor any of its Affiliates has any fiduciary relationship or duty to any Credit Party arising out of or in connection with, and there is no agency, tenancy or joint venture relationship between the Lender and its Affiliates and the Credit Parties by virtue of, any Credit Document or any transaction contemplated therein. Section 10.15 Electronic Execution of Assignments and Other Documents. The words &#8220;execution,&#8221; &#8220;signed,&#8221; &#8220;signature,&#8221; and words of like import in any amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, supplement, waiver, modification or consent relating hereto shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any Applicable Laws, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Section 10.16 USA PATRIOT Act. The Lender hereby notifies each of the Credit Parties that, pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, the Lender is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each of the Credit Parties, and other information that will allow the Lender to identify each of the Credit Parties in accordance with the Patriot Act. Section 10.17 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. (a) The Lender agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed: (i) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential); (ii) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over the Lender or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners); 68 LEGAL02/44107030v1 (iii) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (iv) to any other party hereto; (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Credit Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder; (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to: (A) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in (including, for purposes hereof, any new lenders invited to join hereunder on an increase in the Revolving Loans and Commitments hereunder, whether by exercise of an accordion, by way of amendment or otherwise), any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement; or (B) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower or its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder; (vii) on a confidential basis to: (A) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided for herein; or (B) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided for herein; (viii) with the consent of the Borrower; (ix) to the extent such Information: (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 10.17; or (y) becomes available to the Lender or any of its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower; or (x) for purposes of establishing a &#8220;due diligence&#8221; defense. For purposes of this Section, &#8220;Information&#8221; means all information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Lender on a non-confidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 10.17 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. 69 LEGAL02/44107030v1 </FONT></DIV>
