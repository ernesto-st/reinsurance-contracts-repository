otherwise may be required by applicable law, rules or regulations, or (b)&nbsp;disclosing information
concerning the Employee or the termination of Employee&#146;s employment to officers of the Company or
its affiliates who, at the discretion of the Company, should know such information. &#147;Disparaging&#148;

in this Section&nbsp;6) or distribution by the Company, Holdings or any of their affiliates to or for
the benefit of the Employee, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy,

performance unit, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any
restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a &#147;Payment&#148;), would be

&#147;contingent on a change in ownership or control&#148; of the Company or Holdings, within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;280G of the Code, or any similar tax imposed by state or local law, or any interest or
penalties with respect to such tax (such tax or taxes, together with any such interest and
penalties, being hereafter collectively referred to as the &#147;Excise Tax&#148;), then the Employee shall
be entitled to receive an additional payment or payments (collectively, a &#147;Gross-Up Payment&#148;). The
Gross-Up Payment shall be in an amount such that, after payment by the Employee of all taxes
(including any interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including any Excise Tax
imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the Employee retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to
the Excise Tax imposed upon the Payment. For purposes of determining the amount of the Gross-Up
Payment, the Employee will be considered to pay (x)&nbsp;federal income taxes at the highest rate in
effect in the year in which the Gross-Up Payment will be made and (y)&nbsp;state and local income taxes
at the highest rate in effect in the state or locality in which the Gross-Up Payment would be

obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes.

this Section&nbsp;6, including whether an Excise Tax is payable by the Employee and the amount of such
Excise Tax and whether a Gross-Up Payment is required to be paid by the Company to the Employee and
the amount of such Gross-Up Payment, if any, shall be made by a nationally recognized accounting
firm (the &#147;Accounting Firm&#148;) selected by the Company in his sole discretion. The Company shall
direct the Accounting Firm to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both
the Company and the Employee within thirty (30)&nbsp;calendar days after the Date of Termination, if
applicable, and any such other time or times as may be requested by the Company or the Employee.
If the Accounting Firm determines that any Excise Tax is payable by the Employee, the Company shall
pay the required Gross-Up Payment to the Employee within five (5)&nbsp;business days after receipt of
such determination and calculations with respect to any Payment to the Employee or to the Internal
Revenue Service on the Employee&#146;s behalf. If the Accounting Firm determines that no Excise Tax is
payable by the Employee with respect to any material benefit or amount (or portion thereof), it
shall, at the same time as it makes such determination, furnish the Company and the Employee an
opinion that the Employee has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax on his federal,
state or local income or other tax return. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of
Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code and the possibility of similar uncertainty regarding applicable state or
local tax law at the time of any determination by the Accounting Firm

the Employee has breached the covenants applicable to the Employee contained in Section&nbsp;7, the

Parties will have no obligation to pay any of the amounts that remain payable by the Company under
Section&nbsp;5.2 or 5.3.
