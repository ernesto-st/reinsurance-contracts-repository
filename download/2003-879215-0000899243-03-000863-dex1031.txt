                  (b)   The Term B Borrowings. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, each Term B Lender severally agrees to convert all
of its existing advances in respect of the Polaris Facility to a Term B Loan to
the Borrower on the Closing Date. The Term B Borrowing shall consist of Term B
Loans made simultaneously by the Term B Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share of the Term B Facility. Amounts borrowed under this
Section 2.01(b) and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Term B Loans may be
Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.

                  (c)   The Revolving Credit Borrowings. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, each Revolving Credit Lender severally agrees
to make loans (each such loan, a "Revolving Credit Loan") to the Borrower from
time to time, on any Business Day during the Revolving Availability Period, in
an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment; provided, however, that after giving
effect to any Revolving Credit Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not
exceed the Aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
the Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving L/C Obligations shall not exceed such
Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment. Each Revolving Credit Lender agrees that
an amount of its existing advances under the DHI Existing Revolvers as indicated
opposite its name on Part A of Schedule 2.01 under the caption "Revolving Credit
Commitment" shall be deemed to be Revolving Credit Loans for all purposes of the
Loan Documents. Within the limits of each Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment,
and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow
under this Section 2.01(c), prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this
Section 2.01(c). Revolving Credit Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar
Rate Loans, as further provided herein.

                  (d)   The Reallocated Facility Borrowings. Upon the occurrence
of a Reallocation Event, the Administrative Agents shall notify each Revolving
Credit Lender of such Reallocation Event, the related Reallocation Amount and
each Revolving Credit Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Reallocation Amount. Each
Revolving Credit Lender shall reallocate a portion of its Revolving Credit
Commitment (and, if necessary, a portion of its Revolving Credit Loans) to the
Reallocated Facility in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share with respect to
the Revolving Credit Facility at such time of the Reallocation Amount at such
time and such amount (together with any other amount previously reallocated to
the Reallocated Facility) shall be such

                                       44

<PAGE>

Lender's Reallocated Facility Commitment. In no event shall the aggregate amount
of the Reallocated Lenders' Reallocated Facility Commitments exceed
$200,000,000. Upon any such reallocation, each Revolving Credit Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment (and, if necessary, its Revolving Credit Loans)
shall be reduced by the amount so reallocated. Any Revolving Credit Loan so
converted shall be a Reallocated Facility Loan for all purposes hereof and any
Revolving Letter of Credit so converted shall be a Reallocated Letter of Credit
for all purposes hereof. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Reallocated Facility Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan,
a "Reallocated Facility Loan") to the Borrower from time to time, on any
Business Day during the Reallocated Availability Period, in an aggregate amount
not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of such Lender's Reallocated
Facility Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to any
Reallocated Facility Borrowing, (i) the Total Outstandings shall not exceed the
Aggregate Commitments and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the
Reallocated Facility Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share of
the Outstanding Amount of all Reallocated L/C Obligations shall not exceed such
Lender's Reallocated Facility Commitment. Within the limits of each Lender's
Revolving Credit Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions
hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(d), prepay under Section
2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(d). Reallocated Loans may be Base
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further provided herein.

                  2.02. Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.

                  (a)   Each Term Borrowing, each Revolving Credit Borrowing,
each Reallocated Facility Borrowing, each conversion of Term Loans, Revolving
Credit Loans or Reallocated Loans from one Type to the other, and each
continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made upon the Borrower's
irrevocable notice to the Payment Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each
such notice must be received by the Payment Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
(eastern time) (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any
conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans and (ii) on the requested
date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the
Payment Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and
signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower; provided that upon request by
the Payment Agent, such confirmation shall be received prior to the date of the
related Borrowing (but shall not be required to be received prior to the date
referenced in the previous sentence had the request not been made by telephone).
Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be in a principal amount of $10,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each
Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Committed
Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the
Borrower is requesting a Term Borrowing, a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a
Reallocated Facility Borrowing, a conversion of Term Loans, Revolving Credit
Loans or Reallocated Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or
continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the
principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type
of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Term Loans, Revolving Credit Loans
or Reallocated Facility Loans are to be

                                       45

<PAGE>

converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with
respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed
Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a
conversion or continuation, then the applicable Term Loans, Revolving Credit
Loans or Reallocated Facility Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate
Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of
the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the
applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of,
conversion to, or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Committed
Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have
specified an Interest Period of one month.

                  (b)   Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the
Payment Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its
Pro Rata Share of the applicable Term Loans, Revolving Credit Loans or
Reallocated Facility Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or
continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Payment Agent shall notify each
Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described
in Section 2.02(a). In the case of a Term Borrowing, a Revolving Credit
Borrowing or a Reallocated Facility Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall
make the amount of its Loan available to the Payment Agent in immediately
available funds at the Payment Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. (eastern
time) on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice.
Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 or 4.03
(and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the
Payment Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like
funds as received by the Payment Agent either by (i) crediting the account of
the Borrower on the books of Citibank with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire
transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to
(and reasonably acceptable to) the Payment Agent by the Borrower.

                  (c)   Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate
Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period
for such Eurodollar Rate Loan. During the existence of an Event of Default, no
Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans
without the consent of the Required Lenders.

                  (d)   The Payment Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. The
determination of the Eurodollar Rate by the Payment Agent shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding,
the Payment Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the
Payment Agent's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly following
the public announcement of such change.

                  (e)   After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all
Revolving Credit Borrowings, all Reallocated Facility Borrowings, all
conversions of Term Loans, Revolving Credit Loans or Reallocated Facility Loans
from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans, Revolving
Credit Loans or Reallocated Facility Loans as the same Type, there shall not be
more than ten Interest Periods in effect.

                  (f)   The failure of any Lender to make the Loan to be made by
it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Loan

                                       46

<PAGE>

on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to make the Loan to be made by such other Lender on
the date of any Borrowing.

                  (g)   Anything in this Section 2.02 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate for the initial
Credit Extension hereunder.

                  2.03. Revolving Letters of Credit.

                  (a)   The Revolving Letter of Credit Sublimit.

                  (i)   Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
         (A) the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other
         Revolving Credit Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time
         to time on any Business Day during the period from the Closing Date
         until the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, to issue Revolving Letters
         of Credit for the account of the Borrower (it being understood and
         agreed that subject to the other terms herein, the Borrower may obtain
         for its account Revolving Letters of Credit on behalf of the Parent
         Guarantor or any of its Affiliates), and to amend or renew Revolving
         Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in accordance with Section
         2.03(b), and (2) to honor drafts under the Revolving Letters of Credit;
         and (B) the Revolving Credit Lenders severally agree to participate in
         Revolving Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower;
         provided that the L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to make any
         Revolving L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Revolving Letter of
         Credit, and no Revolving Credit Lender shall be obligated to
         participate in any Revolving Letter of Credit if as of the date of such
         Revolving L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Total Outstandings would exceed
         the Aggregate Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the
         Revolving Credit Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro Rata Share
         of the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving L/C Obligations would exceed
         such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, or (z) the Outstanding
         Amount of the Revolving L/C Obligations would exceed the Revolving
         Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to
         the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain
         Revolving Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and accordingly
         the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain Revolving Letters
         of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have expired or that have
         been drawn upon and reimbursed. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be
         deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the
         Closing Date shall be Revolving Letters of Credit and shall be subject
         to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

                  (ii)  The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any
         Revolving Letter of Credit if:

                        (A)  any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
                  Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin
                  or restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Revolving Letter
                  of Credit, or any Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any
                  request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
                  from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C
                  Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the L/C Issuer refrain
                  from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such
                  Revolving Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon
                  the L/C

                                       47

<PAGE>

                  Issuer with respect to such Revolving Letter of Credit any
                  restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C
                  Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect
                  on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any
                  unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on
                  the Closing Date and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems
                  material to it;

                        (B)   the expiry date of such requested Revolving Letter
                  of Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration
                  Date, unless all the Revolving Credit Lenders have approved
                  such expiry date and have agreed to extend their obligations
                  under Section 2.03(c) with respect to such Revolving Letter of
                  Credit; or

                        (C)   the issuance of such Revolving Letter of Credit
                  would violate one or more generally applicable policies of the
                  L/C Issuer;

                  (iii) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any
         Revolving Letter of Credit in any way (whether or not such amendment
         increases the amount of the applicable Letter of Credit) (A) at any
         time on or after the Maturity Date, or (B) if the beneficiary of such
         Revolving Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to
         such Revolving Letter of Credit. In addition, and without limiting the
         terms of the first sentence of this Section 2.03(a)(iii), the L/C
         Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any Revolving Letter of
         Credit to increase the amount thereof if the L/C Issuer would have no
         obligation at such time to issue such Revolving Letter of Credit in its
         amended form under the terms hereof by reason of the provisions of
         Section 2.03(a)(i), Section 2.03(a)(ii), Section 4.02 or otherwise.

                  (b)   Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Revolving
Letters of Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.

                  (i)   Each Revolving Letter of Credit shall be issued or
         amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered
         to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Payment Agent) in the form of a
         Letter of Credit Application. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
         received by the L/C Issuer and the Payment Agent not later than 11:00
         a.m. (eastern time) at least two Business Days (or such later date and
         time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in its sole
         discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment,
         as the case may be. In the case of a request for an initial issuance of
         a Revolving Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall
         specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer:
         (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Revolving Letter of
         Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the
         expiry date thereof; (D) the currency (which may be Dollars, Canadian
         Dollars, Pounds Sterling or Euros); (E) the name and address of the
         beneficiary thereof; (F) the account party or parties thereof; (G) the
         full text of any certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in
         case of any drawing thereunder; and (H) the transactions or obligations
         to be supported thereby. In the case of a request for an amendment of
         any outstanding Revolving Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit
         Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably satisfactory to
         the L/C Issuer (A) the Revolving Letter of Credit to be amended; (B)
         the proposed date of amendment

                                       48

<PAGE>

         thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed
         amendment; and (D) such other matters consistent with the items set
         forth in clauses (A)-(H) in the preceding sentence as the L/C Issuer
         may reasonably require.

                  (ii)  Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Payment Agent (by
         telephone or in writing) that the Payment Agent has received a copy of
         such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the
         L/C Issuer will provide the Payment Agent with a copy thereof. Upon
         receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Payment Agent that
         the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the
         terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C
         Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Revolving Letter of Credit
         for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment,
         as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's
         usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance
         of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Lender shall be deemed
         to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from
         the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an
         amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata Share times the
         amount of such Revolving Letter of Credit. The L/C Issuer shall not be
         obligated to make any independent determination as to whether the
         requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the
         terms hereof, and, unless and until the L/C Issuer receives such
         confirmation from the Payment Agent, the L/C Issuer shall have no
         obligation to issue the requested Revolving Letter of Credit.

                  (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of
         Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
         discretion, agree to issue an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit. Unless
         otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be
         required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such
         renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the
         Borrower and the Revolving Credit Lenders shall be deemed to have
         authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal
         of such Revolving Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not
         later than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however,
         that (A) the L/C Issuer may give a notice of non-renewal and thereby
         prevent the renewal of an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit if the L/C
         Issuer has determined at any time within 30 calendar days prior to the
         Nonrenewal Notice Date of such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit that it
         would have no obligation at such time to issue such Revolving Letter of
         Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the
         provisions of Section 2.03(a)(i), Section 2.03(a)(ii), Section
         2.03(a)(iii) or otherwise), and (B) the L/C Issuer shall not permit any
         such renewal if it has received notice (which may be by telephone, if
         immediately confirmed in writing, or in writing) on or before the day
         that is ten days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date from the Payment
         Agent or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions
         specified in Section 2.03(a)(i) is not then satisfied.

                  (iv)  Promptly after its delivery of any Revolving Letter of
         Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with
         respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also
         deliver to the Borrower and the Payment Agent a true and complete copy
         of such Revolving Letter of Credit or amendment.

                                       49

                  (c)   Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                  (i)   Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Revolving
         Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Revolving Letter
         of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
         Payment Agent thereof (which may be telephonic, promptly confirmed by
         telecopy). Not later than 12:00 p.m. (eastern time) on an Honor Date,
         the Borrower may reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Payment Agent in
         an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing. If the
         Borrower does not so reimburse the L/C Issuer on the date necessary to
         settle the obligations of the L/C Issuer under any draft drawn or
         demand made under a Revolving Letter of Credit issued for its L/C
         account, the Payment Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit
         Lender of the Honor Date, the Dollar Equivalent of the unreimbursed
         drawing (the "Unreimbursed Revolving Amount"), and the amount of such
         Revolving Credit Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In such event, the
         Unreimbursed Revolving Amount shall automatically be converted (unless
         the Borrower is in Default under Section 8.01(f) or (g)) to a Revolving
         Credit Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date
         in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of the Unreimbursed
         Revolving Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified
         in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans and without
         regard to whether the conditions in Section 4.02 are then satisfied.
         Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Payment Agent pursuant to
         this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if immediately
         confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate
         confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of
         such notice.

                  (ii)  Each Revolving Credit Lender (including the Lender
         acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section
         2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Payment Agent for the account of
         the L/C Issuer at the Payment Agent's Office in an amount equal to its
         Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Revolving Amount not later than 1:00
         p.m. (eastern time) on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
         Payment Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
         2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Credit Lender that so makes funds
         available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower
         in such amount. The Payment Agent shall remit the funds so received to
         the L/C Issuer.

                  (iii) Such Base Rate Loan shall be made as of the date of such
         settlement of such Revolving Letter of Credit. The proceeds of such
         Base Rate Loan shall be paid by the Lenders to the Payment Agent for
         payment to the L/C Issuer of such Revolving Letter of Credit (and the
         Payment Agent shall promptly pay such proceeds to such L/C Issuer) to
         reimburse the L/C Issuer of such Revolving Letter of credit for each
         Lender's Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount actually
         disbursed by the L/C Issuer of such Revolving Letter of Credit pursuant
         to such draft or demand. In the event that the L/C Issuer of a
         Revolving Letter of Credit makes the Draw Amount available to the
         beneficiary of such Revolving Letter of Credit and the Dollar
         Equivalent of such amount made available by the Lenders to the Payment
         Agent for payment to the L/C Issuer is not sufficient to enable the L/C
         Issuer to obtain Alternative Currency equal to the entire Draw Amount,
         the Borrower shall pay the Payment Agent on demand for the benefit of
         such L/C Issuer an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent required to
         enable the L/C Issuer to

                                       50

<PAGE>

         obtain Alternative Currency equal to the Draw Amount, but any shortfall
         shall be immediately converted to an additional Revolving Credit
         Borrowing of Base Rate Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower to the
         extent the Borrower does not immediately make such payment, and the L/C
         Issuer shall be reimbursed therefrom. With respect to any Unreimbursed
         Revolving Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Revolving Credit
         Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the Borrower is in Default under
         Section 8.01(f) or (g) or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be
         deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer a Revolving L/C Borrowing
         in the amount of the Unreimbursed Revolving Amount that is not so
         refinanced, which Revolving L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on
         demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default
         Rate. In such event, each Revolving Credit Lender's payment to the
         Payment Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section
         2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in
         such Revolving L/C Borrowing and shall constitute a Revolving L/C
         Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation
         obligation under this Section 2.03.

              (iv) Until each Revolving Credit Lender funds its Revolving Credit
         Loan or Revolving L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to
         reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any Letter of
         Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
         amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.

              (v)  Each Revolving Credit Lender's obligation to make Revolving
         Credit Loans or Revolving L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for
         amounts drawn under Revolving Letters of Credit, as contemplated by
         this Section 2.03(c), shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not
         be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,
         counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may
         have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other Person for any
         reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, or
         (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to
         any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Credit
         Lender's obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans (but not its
         obligation to make Revolving L/C Advances) pursuant to this Section
         2.03(c) is subject to the Borrower not being in Default under Section
         8.01(f) or (g). No such making of a Revolving L/C Advance shall relieve
         or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C
         Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any
         Revolving Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

              (vi) If any Revolving Credit Lender fails to make available to the
         Payment Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to
         be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
         Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the L/C
         Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through
         the Payment Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for
         the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which
         such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate per
         annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect for
         the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest equal to
         the Base Rate. A certificate of the L/C Issuer submitted to any
         Revolving Credit Lender (through the Payment Agent) with respect to any
         amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent
         manifest error.

                                       51

<PAGE>

              (vii) If at any time a distribution is to be made by the Payment
         Agent to any Lender and such Lender has failed to make available to the
         Payment Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to
         be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
         Section 2.03(c), the Payment Agent shall pay such distribution to the
         L/C Issuer, to the extent of such unpaid amount together with any
         interest thereon accrued pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(vi).

              (d)   Repayment of Participations.

              (i)   At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under
         any Revolving Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving
         Credit Lender such Lender's Revolving L/C Advance in respect of such
         payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c), if the Payment Agent
         receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of
         the related Unreimbursed Revolving Amount or interest thereon (whether
         directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash
         Collateral applied thereto by the Payment Agent), the Payment Agent
         will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof
         (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect
         the period of time during which such Lender's Revolving L/C Advance was
         outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Payment Agent.

              (ii)  If any payment received by the Payment Agent for the account
         of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be
         returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06
         (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in
         its discretion), each Revolving Credit Lender shall pay to the Payment
         Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on
         demand of the Payment Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
         such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at a
         rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
         effect for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of interest
         equal to the Base Rate.

              (e)   Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Revolving Letter of Credit
and (without duplication) to repay each Revolving L/C Borrowing shall be
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including
the following:

              (i)   any lack of validity or enforceability of such Revolving
         Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
         relating thereto;

              (ii)  the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or
         other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any
         beneficiary or any transferee of such Revolving Letter of Credit (or
         any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
         acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with
         this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
         Revolving Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating
         thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                                       52

<PAGE>

              (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented
         under such Revolving Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
         invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
         untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the
         transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a
         drawing under such Revolving Letter of Credit;

              (iv)  any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Revolving Letter of
         Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Revolving Letter of Credit; or
         any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Revolving Letter of
         Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy,
         debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
         liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any
         beneficiary or any transferee of such Revolving Letter of Credit,
         including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any
         Debtor Relief Law;

              (v)   any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Collateral, or
         any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from the
         Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of
         the Borrower in respect of such Revolving Letter of Credit; or

              (vi)  any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
         that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
         of, the Borrower, except as otherwise provided in clause (f) of this
         Section 2.03.

              The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Revolving
Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the
event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other
irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower
shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C
Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

              (f)   Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Credit Lender and the
Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Revolving Letter of Credit,
the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other
than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the
Revolving Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or
accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or
delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person
nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C
Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in
connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the
Required Revolving Credit Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken or
omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii) the
due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Revolving Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of
any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Revolving Letter of
Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall
not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have
against the

                                       53

<PAGE>

beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C
Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or responsible for
any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 2.03(e);
provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer, and the
L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the extent,
of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the
Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C Issuer's willful
misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful failure to pay under
any Revolving Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary
of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying with the terms and
conditions of a Revolving Letter of Credit AND THE PARENT GUARANTOR AND THE
BORROWER FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, HEREBY WAIVES AND RELINQUISHES
ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IT MAY HAVE FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY
DAMAGES AND FOR DIRECT DAMAGES RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE BY THE L/C ISSUER WHICH
DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of
any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Revolving Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for
any reason.

              (g)   Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Payment Agent or
the L/C Issuer to the Borrower, if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date,
any Revolving Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and
partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize
the then Outstanding Amount of all Revolving L/C Obligations (in an amount equal
to such Outstanding Amount determined as of the Letter of Credit Expiration
Date). The Borrower hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of
the L/C Issuer and the Revolving Credit Lenders, a security interest in all such
cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the
foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a Cash Collateral Account. If
at any time the Collateral Agent determines that any funds held as Cash
Collateral are subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the
Collateral Agent or that the total amount of such funds is less than the
aggregate Outstanding Amount of all Revolving L/C Obligations that are required
to be Cash Collateralized at such time, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand
by the Collateral Agent, pay to the Collateral Agent, as additional funds to be
deposited and held in such Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the
excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of
funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Collateral Agent determines
to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any
Revolving Letter of Credit for which funds are on deposit as Cash Collateral,
such funds shall be applied, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to
reimburse the L/C Issuer. So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, upon payment, expiration or termination of a Letter of Credit
that was Cash Collateralized, applicable amounts on deposit in Cash Collateral
Accounts shall be promptly returned to the Borrower.

                                       54

              (h)   Applicability of ISP98 and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by the L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Revolving Letter of Credit is
issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of
Credit), (i) the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published
by the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later version
thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to each standby
Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision
published by the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998
regarding the European single currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial
Letter of Credit, and to the extent not inconsistent with the above referred
rules, the laws of the State of New York.

              (i)   Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Payment
Agent for the account of each Revolving Credit Lender in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share a Letter of Credit fee for each Revolving Letter of Credit equal to
the Applicable Rate per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans times the daily maximum
amount available to be drawn under such Revolving Letter of Credit provided,
however, that for purposes of this Section 2.03(i), the Dollar Equivalent of
each Revolving Letter of Credit in an Alternative Currency will be deemed to be,
on any day (i) during the month the Revolving Letter of Credit was issued or
renewed, the Dollar Equivalent on the date of issuance or renewal of such
Revolving Letter of Credit or (ii) in any month subsequent to the month of
issuance or renewal, the Dollar Equivalent on the first Business Day of such
subsequent month, in each case from and including the date issued to and
including the date of its expiration or earlier termination. Such letter of
credit fees shall be computed on a monthly basis in arrears. Such letter of
credit fees shall be due and payable on the 5th Business Day following receipt
by the Borrower of an invoice for such Letter of Credit fees owing with respect
to the prior calendar month commencing with the first such date to occur after
the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

              (j)   Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable
to L/C Issuer. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay to the L/C Issuer solely for
its benefit, (i) in the case of Revolving Letters of Credit that are standby
Letters of Credit a Letter of Credit fronting fee of 15.0 basis points per annum
(calculated for the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year
consisting of 365, or when appropriate 366, days) on the daily average available
amount under each such Revolving Letter of Credit issued, increased or extended
by the L/C Issuer from and including the date issued, increased or extended to
and including the date of its expiration or earlier termination, (ii) in the
case of Revolving Letters of Credit that are commercial Letters of Credit a
Letter of Credit fronting fee of 15.0 basis points per annum (calculated for the
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year consisting of 365, or when
appropriate 366, days) on the daily average available amount under each such
Revolving Letter of Credit issued, increased or extended by the L/C Issuer from
and including the date issued, increased or extended to and including the date
of its expiration or earlier termination, and (iii) a fee for each issuance,
amendment or renewal of, and for each negotiation of a draft drawn under, a
Revolving Letter of Credit issued, increased or extended by such L/C Issuer in
the amount customarily charged by such Issuer from time to time or such other
amount that may be agreed to in writing from time to time by the L/C Issuer and
the Borrower provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 2.03, the
Dollar Equivalent of each Revolving Letter of Credit in an Alternative Currency
will be deemed to be, on any day (i) during the month the Revolving Letter of
Credit

                                       55

<PAGE>

was issued or renewed, the Dollar Equivalent on the date of issuance or renewal
of such Revolving Letter of Credit or (ii) in any month subsequent to the month
of issuance or renewal, the Dollar Equivalent on the first Business Day of such
subsequent month, in each case from and including the date issued to and
including the date of its expiration or earlier termination. The Borrower shall
pay to the Payment Agent on the 5th Business Day following receipt by the
Borrower of an invoice for such fees owing with respect to the prior calendar
month, the Letter of Credit fronting fee due with respect to each outstanding
Revolving Letter of Credit in respect of each Revolving Letter of Credit
outstanding commencing on the first such date to occur after such Revolving
Letter of Credit is issued, increased or extended and on the Maturity Date in
respect of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Payment Agent shall promptly remit
to the L/C Issuer any Letter of Credit fronting fee due to the L/C Issuer after
the Payment Agent's receipt of such fee.

              (k)   Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of

any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

              2.04. Reallocated Letters of Credit.

              (a)   The Reallocated Letter of Credit Sublimit.

              (i)   Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A)
         the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the other
         Reallocated Facility Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, (1) from
         time to time on any Business Day during the Reallocated Availability
         Period, to issue Reallocated Letters of Credit for the account of the
         Borrower (it being understood and agreed that subject to the other
         terms herein, the Borrower may obtain for its account Reallocated
         Letters of Credit on behalf of the Parent Guarantor or any of its
         Affiliates), and to amend or renew Reallocated Letters of Credit
         previously issued by it, in accordance with Section 2.04(b), and (2) to
         honor drafts under the Reallocated Letters of Credit; and (B) the
         Reallocated Facility Lenders severally agree to participate in
         Reallocated Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower;
         provided that the L/C Issuer shall not be obligated to make any
         Reallocated L/C Credit Extension with respect to any Reallocated Letter
         of Credit, and no Reallocated Facility Lender shall be obligated to
         participate in any Reallocated Letter of Credit if as of the date of
         such Reallocated L/C Credit Extension, (x) the Total Outstandings would
         exceed the Aggregate Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount
         of the Reallocated Facility Loans of any Lender, plus such Lender's Pro
         Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all Reallocated L/C Obligations
         would exceed such Lender's Reallocated Facility Commitment, or (z) the
         Outstanding Amount of the Reallocated L/C Obligations would exceed the
         Reallocated Letter of Credit Sublimit. Within the foregoing limits, and
         subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to
         obtain Reallocated Letters of Credit shall be fully revolving, and
         accordingly the Borrower may, during the foregoing period, obtain
         Reallocated Letters of Credit to replace Letters of Credit that have
         expired or that have been drawn upon and reimbursed.

              (ii)  The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to issue any
         Reallocated Letter of Credit if:

                                       56

<PAGE>

                (A)  any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
         or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the L/C
         Issuer from issuing such Reallocated Letter of Credit, or any Law
         applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or
         not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with
         jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that the
         L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or
         such Reallocated Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon
         the L/C Issuer with respect to such Reallocated Letter of Credit any
         restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C Issuer
         is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing
         Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost
         or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the
         L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

                (B)  the expiry date of such requested Reallocated Letter of
         Credit would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless
         all the Reallocated Lenders have approved such expiry date and have
         agreed to extend their obligations under Section 2.04(c) with respect
         to such Reallocated Letter of Credit; or

                (C)  the issuance of such Reallocated Letter of Credit would
         violate one or more generally applicable policies of the L/C Issuer.

         (iii)  The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any
    Reallocated Letter of Credit in any way (whether or not such amendment
    increases the amount of the applicable Letter of Credit ) (A) at any time on
    or after the Maturity Date, or (B) if the beneficiary of such Reallocated
    Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such Reallocated
    Letter of Credit. In addition, and without limiting the terms of the first
    sentence of this Section 2.04(a)(iii), the L/C Issuer shall be under no
    obligation to amend any Reallocated Letter of Credit to increase the amount
    thereof if the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue
    such Reallocated Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof
    by reason of the provisions of Section 2.04(a)(i), Section 2.04(a)(ii),
    Section 4.02 or otherwise.

         (b)    Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Reallocated Letters of
Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.

         (i)    Each Reallocated Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as
    the case may be, upon the request of the Borrower delivered to the L/C
    Issuer (with a copy to the Payment Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit
    Application. Such Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C
    Issuer and the Payment Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (eastern time) at
    least two Business Days (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may
    agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed
    issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a
    request for an initial issuance of a Reallocated Letter of Credit, such
    Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and detail reasonably
    satisfactory to the L/C Issuer: (A) the proposed issuance date of the
    requested Reallocated Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B)
    the amount thereof; (C) the expiry date thereof; (D) the currency (which may

                                       57

<PAGE>

         be Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Pounds, Sterling or Euros); (E) the name
         and address of the beneficiary thereof; (F) the account party or
         parties thereof; (G) the full text of any certificate to be presented
         by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (H) the
         transactions or obligations to be supported thereby. In the case of a
         request for an amendment of any outstanding Reallocated Letter of
         Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and
         detail reasonably satisfactory to the L/C Issuer (A) the Reallocated
         Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the proposed date of amendment
         thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C) the nature of the proposed
         amendment; and (D) such other matters consistent with the items set
         forth in clauses (A)-(H) in the preceding sentence as the L/C Issuer
         may reasonably require.

                (ii)  Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
         Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Payment Agent (by
         telephone or in writing) that the Payment Agent has received a copy of
         such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower and, if not, the
         L/C Issuer will provide the Payment Agent with a copy thereof. Upon
         receipt by the L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Payment Agent that
         the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in accordance with the
         terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C
         Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Reallocated Letter of
         Credit for the account of the Borrower or enter into the applicable
         amendment, as the case may be, in each case in accordance with the L/C
         Issuer's usual and customary business practices. Immediately upon the
         issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Reallocated Facility Lender
         shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
         to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of
         Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Lender's Pro Rata
         Share times the amount of such Reallocated Letter of Credit. The L/C
         Issuer shall not be obligated to make any independent determination as
         to whether the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in
         accordance with the terms hereof and, unless and until the L/C Issuer
         receives such confirmation from the Payment Agent, the L/C Issuer shall
         have no obligation to issue the requested Reallocated Letter of Credit.

                (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of
         Credit Application, the L/C Issuer may, in its sole and absolute
         discretion, agree to issue an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit. Unless
         otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be
         required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer for any such
         renewal. Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the
         Borrower and the Reallocated Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized
         (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such
         Reallocated Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later
         than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that (A)
         the L/C Issuer may give a notice of non-renewal and thereby prevent the
         renewal of an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer has
         determined at any time within 30 calendar days prior to the Nonrenewal
         Notice Date of such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit that it would have no
         obligation at such time to issue such Reallocated Letter of Credit in
         its renewed form under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of
         Section 2.04(a)(i), Section 2.04(a)(ii), Section 2.04(a)(iii) or
         otherwise), and (B) the L/C Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if
         it has received notice (which may be by telephone, if immediately
         confirmed in writing, or in writing) on or before the day that is ten
         days

                                       58

<PAGE>

         before the Nonrenewal Notice Date from the Payment Agent or the
         Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
         Section 2.04(a)(i) is not then satisfied.

                (iv)  Promptly after its delivery of any Reallocated Letter of
         Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with
         respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also
         deliver to the Borrower and the Payment Agent a true and complete copy
         of such Reallocated Letter of Credit or amendment.

                (c)   Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                (i)   Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Reallocated
         Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Reallocated
         Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall promptly notify the Borrower and
         the Payment Agent thereof (which may be telephonic, promptly confirmed
         by telecopy). Not later than 12:00 p.m. (eastern time) on an Honor
         Date, the Borrower may reimburse the L/C Issuer through the Payment
         Agent in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing. If
         the Borrower does not so reimburse the L/C Issuer on the date necessary
         to settle the obligations of the L/C Issuer under any draft drawn or
         demand made under a Reallocated Letter of Credit issued for its L/C
         account, the Payment Agent shall promptly notify each Reallocated
         Facility Lender of the Honor Date, the Dollar Equivalent of the
         unreimbursed drawing (the "Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount"), and the
         amount of such Reallocated Facility Lender's Pro Rata Share thereof. In
         such event, the Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount shall automatically be
         converted (unless the Borrower is in Default under Section 8.01(f) or
         (g)) to a Reallocated Facility Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be
         disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent
         of the Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount, without regard to the minimum
         and multiples specified in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of
         Base Rate Loans and without regard to whether the conditions in Section
         4.02 are then satisfied. Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the
         Payment Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)(i) may be given by
         telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack
         of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness
         or binding effect of such notice.

                (ii)  Each Reallocated Facility Lender (including the Lender
         acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to Section
         2.04(c)(i) make funds available to the Payment Agent for the account of
         the L/C Issuer at the Payment Agent's Office in an amount equal to its
         Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount not later than
         1:00 p.m. (eastern time) on the Business Day specified in such notice
         by the Payment Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
         2.04(c)(iii), each Reallocated Facility Lender that so makes funds
         available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower
         in such amount. The Payment Agent shall remit the funds so received to
         the L/C Issuer.

                (iii) Such Base Rate Loan shall be made as of the date of such
         settlement of such Reallocated Letter of Credit. The proceeds of such
         Base Rate Loan shall be paid by the Lenders to the Payment Agent for
         payment to the L/C Issuer of such Reallocated Letter of Credit (and the
         Payment Agent shall promptly pay such proceeds to such L/C Issuer) to
         reimburse the L/C Issuer of such Reallocated Letter of Credit for each
         Lender's

                                       59

<PAGE>

         Percentage of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount actually disbursed by
         the L/C Issuer of such Reallocated Letter of Credit pursuant to such
         draft or demand. In the event that the L/C Issuer of a Reallocated
         Letter of Credit makes the Draw Amount available to the beneficiary of
         such Reallocated Letter of Credit and the Dollar Equivalent of such
         amount made available by the Lenders to the Payment Agent for payment
         to the L/C Issuer is not sufficient to enable the L/C Issuer to obtain
         Alternative Currency equal to the entire Draw Amount, the Borrower
         shall pay the Payment Agent on demand for the benefit of such L/C
         Issuer an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent required to enable the
         L/C Issuer to obtain Alternative Currency equal to the Draw Amount, but
         any shortfall shall be immediately converted to an additional
         Reallocated Facility Borrowing of Base Rate Loans made by the Lenders
         to the Borrower to the extent the Borrower does not immediately make
         such payment, and the L/C Issuer shall be reimbursed therefrom. With
         respect to any Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount that is not fully
         refinanced by a Reallocated Facility Borrowing of Base Rate Loans
         because the Borrower is in Default under Section 8.01(f) or (g) or for
         any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from
         the L/C Issuer a Reallocated L/C Borrowing in the amount of the
         Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount that is not so refinanced, which
         Reallocated L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together
         with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such
         event, each Reallocated Facility Lender's payment to the Payment Agent
         for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(ii) shall
         be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such Reallocated
         L/C Borrowing and shall constitute a Reallocated L/C Advance from such
         Lender in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this
         Section 2.04.

               (iv) Until each Reallocated Facility Lender funds its Reallocated
         Facility Loan or Reallocated L/C Advance pursuant to this Section
         2.04(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer for any amount drawn under any
         Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Lender's Pro Rata Share
         of such amount shall be solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.

               (v)  Each Reallocated Facility Lender's obligation to make
         Reallocated Facility Loans or Reallocated L/C Advances to reimburse the
         L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Reallocated Letters of Credit, as
         contemplated by this Section 2.04(c), shall be absolute and
         unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including
         (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which
         such Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the Borrower or any other
         Person for any reason whatsoever; (B) the occurrence or continuance of
         a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each
         Reallocated Facility Lender's obligation to make Reallocated Facility
         Loans (but not its obligation to make Reallocated L/C Advances)
         pursuant to Section 2.04(c) is subject to the Borrower not being in
         Default under Section 8.01(f) or (g). No such making of a Reallocated
         L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the
         Borrower to reimburse the L/C Issuer for the amount of any payment made
         by the L/C Issuer under any Reallocated Letter of Credit, together with
         interest as provided herein.

               (vi) If any Reallocated Facility Lender fails to make available
         to the Payment Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount
         required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
         of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in

                                       60

<PAGE>

         Section 2.04(c)(ii), the L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from
         such Lender (acting through the Payment Agent), on demand, such amount
         with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is
         required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to
         the L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from
         time to time in effect for the first three days and, thereafter, at a
         rate of interest equal to the Base Rate. A certificate of the L/C
         Issuer submitted to any Reallocated Facility Lender (through the
         Payment Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section
         2.04(c)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

               (vii) If at any time a distribution is to be made by the Payment
         Agent to any Lender and such Lender has failed to make available to the
         Payment Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required to
         be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
         Section 2.04(c), the Payment Agent shall pay such distribution to the
         L/C Issuer, to the extent of such amount together with any interest
         accrued thereon pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(vi).

               (d)   Repayment of Participations.

               (i)   At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under
         any Reallocated Letter of Credit and has received from any Reallocated
         Facility Lender such Lender's Reallocated L/C Advance in respect of
         such payment in accordance with Section 2.04(c), if the Payment Agent
         receives for the account of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of
         the related Unreimbursed Reallocated Amount or interest thereon
         (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of
         Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Payment Agent), the Payment
         Agent will distribute to such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof
         (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect
         the period of time during which such Lender's Reallocated L/C Advance
         was outstanding) in the same funds as those received by the Payment
         Agent.

               (ii)  If any payment received by the Payment Agent for the
         account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) is required to
         be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06
         (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in
         its discretion), each Reallocated Facility Lender shall pay to the
         Payment Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share
         thereof on demand of the Payment Agent, plus interest thereon from the
         date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender,
         at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time
         in effect for the first three days and, thereafter, at a rate of
         interest equal to the Base Rate.

               (e)   Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Reallocated Letter of
Credit and (without duplication) to repay each Reallocated L/C Borrowing shall
be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including
the following:

               (i)   any lack of validity or enforceability of such Reallocated
         Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument
         relating thereto;

                                       61

<PAGE>

               (ii)  the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense
         or other right that the Borrower may have at any time against any
         beneficiary or any transferee of such Reallocated Letter of Credit (or
         any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be
         acting), the L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with
         this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such
         Reallocated Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating
         thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

               (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented
         under such Reallocated Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
         fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
         therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay
         in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to
         make a drawing under such Reallocated Letter of Credit;

               (iv)  any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Reallocated Letter
         of Credit against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not
         strictly comply with the terms of such Reallocated Letter of Credit; or
         any payment made by the L/C Issuer under such Reallocated Letter of
         Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy,
         debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors,
         liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any
         beneficiary or any transferee of such Reallocated Letter of Credit,
         including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any
         Debtor Relief Law;

               (v)   any exchange, release or nonperfection of any Collateral,
         or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from
         the Guaranty or any other guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations
         of the Borrower in respect of such Reallocated Letter of Credit; or

               (vi)  any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
         not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
         that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge
         of, the Borrower, except as otherwise provided in clause (f) of this
         Section 2.04.

The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Reallocated Letter of Credit
and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any
claim of noncompliance with the Borrower's instructions or other irregularity,
the Borrower will immediately notify the L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

               (f)   Role of L/C Issuer. Each Reallocated Facility Lender and
the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Reallocated Letter of
Credit, the L/C Issuer shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document
(other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by
the Reallocated Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity
or accuracy of any such document or the authority of the Person executing or
delivering any such document. None of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person
nor any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C
Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in
connection herewith at the request or with the approval of the Lenders or the
Required Reallocated Lenders, as applicable; (ii) any action taken

                                       62

<PAGE>

or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct; or (iii)
the due execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Reallocated Letter of Credit or Letter of Credit
Application. The Borrower hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of
any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Reallocated Letter
of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall
not, preclude the Borrower's pursuing such rights and remedies as it may have
against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None
of the L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective
correspondents, participants or assignees of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or
responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (v) of
Section 2.04(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer,
and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the extent, but only to the
extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages
suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were caused by the L/C
Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C Issuer's willful
failure to pay under any Reallocated Letter of Credit after the presentation to
it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying
with the terms and conditions of a Reallocated Letter of Credit AND THE PARENT
GUARANTOR AND THE BORROWER FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES, HEREBY WAIVES
AND RELINQUISHES ANY AND ALL CLAIMS IT MAY HAVE FOR INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES AND FOR DIRECT DAMAGES RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE BY THE L/C
ISSUER WHICH DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C
Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the
validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
purporting to transfer or assign a Reallocated Letter of Credit or the rights or
benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to
be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

         (g)   Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Payment Agent or the L/C
Issuer to the Borrower, if, as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any
Reallocated Letter of Credit may for any reason remain outstanding and partially
or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall immediately Cash Collateralize the then
Outstanding Amount of all Reallocated L/C Obligations (in an amount equal to
such Outstanding Amount determined as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date).
The Borrower hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the L/C
Issuer and the Reallocated Credit Lenders, a security interest in all such cash,
deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of the foregoing.
Cash Collateral shall be maintained in a Cash Collateral Account. If at any time
the Collateral Agent determines that any funds held as Cash Collateral are
subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Collateral Agent or
that the total amount of such funds is less than the aggregate Outstanding
Amount of all Reallocated L/C Obligations that are required to be Cash
Collateralized at such time, the Borrower will, forthwith upon demand by the
Collateral Agent, pay to the Collateral Agent, as additional funds to be
deposited and held in such Cash Collateral Account, an amount equal to the
excess of (a) such aggregate Outstanding Amount over (b) the total amount of
funds, if any, then held as Cash Collateral that the Collateral Agent determines
to be free and clear of any such right and claim. Upon the drawing of any

other amount that may be agreed to in writing from time to time by the L/C
Issuer and the Borrower provided, however, that for purposes of this Section

shall be paid on the 5th Business day following receipt by the Borrower of an
invoice on the first such date to occur after the effective date of such
termination.

           2.07. Repayment of Loans.

           (a)   Term A Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Payment Agent for
the ratable account of the Term A Lenders the aggregate principal amount of all
Term A Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date for the Term A Facility.

           (b)   Term B Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Payment Agent for
the ratable account of the Term B Lenders the aggregate principal amount of all
Term B Loans outstanding on the Maturity Date for the Term B Facility.

           (c)   Revolving Credit Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Payment
Agent for the ratable account of the Revolving Credit Lenders on the Maturity
Date for the Revolving Credit Facility the aggregate principal amount of all
Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on such date.

           (d)   Reallocated Facility Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the
Payment Agent for the ratable account of the Reallocated Facility Lenders on the
Maturity Date for the Reallocated Facility the aggregate principal amount of all
Reallocated Loans outstanding on such date.

           2.08. Interest.

                                       71

<PAGE>

           (a)   Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate.

           (b)   Subject to the provisions of Section 11.10, if any amount
payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without
regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a
fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Furthermore, while any Event of
Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all
outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws. Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including
interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

           (c)   Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

           2.09. Fees. In addition to certain fees described in Sections 2.03(i)
and (j) and 2.04(i) and (j):

           (a)   Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Payment Agent for
the account of each Appropriate Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
commitment fee equal to 0.50% per annum times the actual daily amount by which
(i) in the case of the Revolving Credit Lenders, the aggregate Revolving Credit
Commitments exceed the sum of (A) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Credit
Loans and (B) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving L/C Obligations and (ii) in
the case of the Reallocated Facility Lenders, the aggregate Reallocated Facility
Commitments exceed the sum of (A) the Outstanding Amount of Reallocated Facility
Loans and (B) the Outstanding Amount of Reallocated L/C Obligations; provided,
however, that any commitment fee accrued with respect to any of the Commitments
of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior to the time such Lender became a
Defaulting Lender and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrower
so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender except to the extent that
such commitment fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrower
prior to such time; and provided further that no commitment fee shall accrue on
any of the Commitments of a Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the
Revolving Availability Period and the Reallocated Availability Period, as
applicable, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in
Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable monthly in arrears on the
5th Business Day following receipt by the Borrower of an invoice with
appropriate back up, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date for the applicable Facility. The
commitment fee shall be calculated monthly in arrears.

                                       72

<PAGE>

           (b)   Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to the Co-Lead Arrangers
and the Payment Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and
at the times specified in the Fee Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when
paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

           (ii)  The Borrower shall pay to the Agents such fees as shall have
been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so
specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable
for any reason whatsoever.

           2.10. Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Citibank's "base rate"
or fees shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of interest shall be made on
the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees
or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a
365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan
is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on
which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on
the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear
interest for one day. Each determination by the Payment Agent of an interest
rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

           2.11. Evidence of Indebtedness.

           (a)   The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Payment
Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by
the Payment Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of
the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the
interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so
shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event
of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and
the accounts and records of the Payment Agent in respect of such matters, the
accounts and records of the Payment Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Payment Agent,
the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Payment
Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such
accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse
thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and
payments with respect thereto.

           (b)   In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section
2.11(a), each Lender and the Payment Agent shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such
Lender of participations in Revolving Letters of Credit and Reallocated Letters
of Credit. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by the Payment Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Payment Agent shall
control in the absence of manifest error.

                                       73

<PAGE>

           (c)   Entries made in good faith by the Payment Agent in the Register
pursuant to Section 2.11(b), and by each Lender in its account or accounts
pursuant to Section 2.11(a), shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of
principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case of such
account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the failure of the Payment Agent
or such Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in
the Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

           2.12. Payments Generally.

           (a)   All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder shall be made to the Payment Agent, for the account of the respective
Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Payment Agent's Office in Dollars
and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. (eastern time) on
the date specified herein for such payment. The Payment Agent will promptly
distribute to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as
provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to
such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Payment Agent after
2:00 p.m. (eastern time) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding
Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

           (b)   If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a
day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following
Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing
interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension
would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Loans to be
made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day.

           (c)   Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Payment
Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Payment
Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not
make such payment, the Payment Agent may assume that the Borrower or such
Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not
be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount
to the Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not
in fact made to the Payment Agent in immediately available funds, then:

           (i)   if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender shall
     forthwith on demand repay to the Payment Agent the portion of such assumed
     payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately available
     funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and
     including the date such amount was made available by the Payment Agent to
     such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Payment Agent in
     immediately available funds at the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in
     effect; and

                                       74

<PAGE>

           (ii)  if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall
     forthwith on demand pay to the Payment Agent the amount thereof in
     immediately available funds, together with interest thereon for the period
     from the date such amount was made available by the Payment Agent to the
     Borrower to the date such amount is recovered by the Payment Agent (the
     "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
     from time to time in effect. If such Lender pays such amount to the Payment
     Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in the
     applicable Borrowing. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith
     upon the Payment Agent's demand therefor, the Payment Agent may make a
     demand therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount
     to the Payment Agent, together with interest thereon for the Compensation
     Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate of interest applicable to the
     applicable Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender
     from its obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights
     which the Payment Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a
     result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

           A notice of the Payment Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under this Section 2.12(c) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

           (d)   If any Lender makes available to the Payment Agent funds for
any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of
this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the
Payment Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set
forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Payment Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received
from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

           (e)   The obligations of the Appropriate Lenders hereunder to make
Loans and to fund participations in Revolving Letters of Credit and Reallocated
Letters of Credit are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make
any Loan or to fund any such participation on any date required hereunder shall
not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such
date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to
so make its Loan or purchase its participation.

           (f)   Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

           (g)   Whenever any payment received by the Payment Agent under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is insufficient to pay in full all
amounts due and payable to the Agents and the Lenders under or in respect of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on any date, such payment shall be
distributed by the Payment Agent and applied by the Agents and the Lenders in
the order of priority set forth in Section 5.01 of the Collateral Trust
Agreement. If the Payment Agent receives funds for application to the
Obligations of the Loan Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents under
circumstances for which the Loan Documents do not specify the manner in which
such funds are to be applied, the Payment Agent may, but shall not be obligated
to, elect to distribute such funds to each of the Lenders in accordance with
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the sum of (A) the Outstanding Amount of all

                                       75

<PAGE>

Loans outstanding at such time, (B) the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving L/C
Obligations outstanding at such time and (C) the Outstanding Amount of all
Reallocated L/C Obligations outstanding at such time, in repayment or prepayment
of such of the outstanding Loans or other Obligations then owing to such Lender.

           2.13. Sharing of Payments. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Lender shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it, or
the participations in Revolving L/C Obligations or in Reallocated L/C
Obligations held by it, any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of setoff, or otherwise) in excess of its ratable share
(or other share contemplated hereunder) thereof, such Lender shall immediately
(a) notify the Payment Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other
Lenders under the Facility in respect of which such excess payment was made such
participations in the Loans made by them and/or such subparticipations in the
participations in Revolving L/C Obligations or Reallocated L/C Obligations held
by them, as the case may be, as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Lender to share the excess payment in respect of such Loans or such
participations, as the case may be, pro rata with each of them; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the purchasing Lender under any of the circumstances described in
Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
purchasing Lender in its discretion), such purchase shall to that extent be
rescinded and each such other Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from
the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered, without further
interest thereon. The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of setoff, but subject
to Section 11.09) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
The Payment Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in
the absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section
and will in each case notify the Lenders following any such purchases or
repayments. Each Lender that purchases a participation pursuant to this Section
2.13 shall from and after such purchase have the right to give all notices,
requests, demands, directions and other communications under this Agreement with
respect to the portion of the Obligations purchased to the same extent as though
the purchasing Lender were the original owner of the Obligations purchased.

                                  Article III
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

           3.01. Taxes.

           (a)   Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
any Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free and clear of
and without deduction for any and all present or future withholding taxes,
including duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings
or similar charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the
case of each Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its
income by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the Laws
of which such

                                       76

<PAGE>

Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is organized or in which it maintains
a Lending Office and (ii) in the case of a Foreign Lender, any taxes imposed
(other than taxes imposed because of a change in law (including a rate change),
treaty, governmental rule or the application thereof, which change occurs after
the date hereof, or in the case of an entity that becomes a Foreign Lender after
the date hereof, after such entity becomes a Lender) by the United States of
America by means of withholding at the source if and to the extent that such
taxes shall be in effect and shall be applicable, under Laws in effect on the
date hereof (or, with respect to any entity that becomes a Foreign Lender after
the date hereof, on the date such entity becomes a Lender), on payments to be
made to such Foreign Lender after taking into account any forms or certificates
provided by such Foreign Lender under Section 11.15 (all such non-excluded
taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or
similar charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If
the Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable under any Loan Document to any Agent or any Lender,
(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable
under this Section), each of such Agent and such Lender receives an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such
payment, the Borrower shall furnish to such Agent or Lender (as the case may be)
(which shall forward the same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy
of a receipt evidencing payment thereof to the extent such a receipt is issued
therefor, or other written proof of payment thereof that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Payment Agent.

           (b)   In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
future stamp, court or documentary taxes and any other excise or property,
intangible, mortgage recording or similar taxes, charges or levies which arise
from any payment made by the Borrower under any Loan Document or from the
execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of any Loan
Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

           (c)   The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Agent and each Lender for
(i) the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section)
paid by such Agent and such Lender and (ii) any liability (including additions
to tax, penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, except as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Agent or such Lender (as the case may be), in each case whether or not such
Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. Payment under this Section 3.01(c) shall be
made within 30 days after the date such Agent or such Lender makes a demand
therefor.

           3.02. Illegality. If any Lender determines that the introduction of
or change in or in the interpretation of any Law has made it unlawful, or that
any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Rate Loans,
or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then,
on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Payment Agent, any
obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such
Lender notifies the Payment Agent

                                       77

<PAGE>

and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no
longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from
such Lender (with a copy to the Payment Agent), prepay or, if applicable,
convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on
the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if
such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.
Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate
a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such
notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be
materially disadvantageous to such Lender.

           3.03. Inability to Determine Rates. If the Required Lenders determine
that for any reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, or that Dollar
deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar
market for the applicable amount and the Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate
Loan, the Payment Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until the Payment Agent (upon the instruction of the
Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower
may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation
of Eurodollar Rate Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Committed Loan Notice of Base Rate Loans in the
amount specified therein.

           3.04. Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves
on Eurodollar Rate Loans.

           (a)   If any Lender determines that as a result of the introduction
of or any change in or in the interpretation of any Law, in each case after the
date hereof, or such Lender's compliance therewith, there shall be any increase
in the cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Eurodollar Rate Loans or (as the case may be) issuing or participating in
Letters of Credit, or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such
Lender in connection with any of the foregoing (excluding for purposes of this
Section 3.04(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from
(i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern) and (ii)
changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or overall gross income
by the United States or any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of
either thereof under the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its
Lending Office), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy
of such demand to the Payment Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or
reduction.

           (b)   If any Lender determines that the introduction of any Law
regarding capital adequacy or any change therein or in the interpretation
thereof, in each case after the date hereof, or compliance by such Lender (or
its Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on
the capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a
consequence of such Lender's obligations hereunder (taking into consideration
its

                                       78

<PAGE>

policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Lender's desired return on
capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender (with a copy of such
demand to the Payment Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such
additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.

           3.05. Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Payment Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such
Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred
by it as a result of:

           (a)   any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
     other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
     Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
     reason of acceleration, or otherwise); or

           (b)   any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the
     failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or
     convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount
     notified by the Borrower;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit
or other borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for a comparable
amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was
in fact so funded.

           3.06. Matters Applicable to all Requests for Compensation. A
certificate of any Agent or any Lender claiming compensation under this Article
III and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In determining
such amount, such Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

           3.07. Survival. All of the Borrower's obligations under this Article
III shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS

           4.01. Conditions of Initial Credit Extension. The obligation of each
Lender to make its initial Credit Extension hereunder is subject to satisfaction
of the following conditions precedent:

           (a)   The Administrative Agents' receipt of the following, each of
which shall be originals or facsimiles (followed promptly by originals) unless
otherwise specified,

                                       79

<PAGE>

         each properly executed by a Responsible Officer of the signing Loan
         Party, each dated the Closing Date (or, in the case of certificates of
         governmental officials, a recent date before the Closing Date) and each
         in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agents and
         their legal counsel:

                    (i)    executed counterparts of this Agreement and the

         5.14. Margin Regulations; Investment Company Act; Public Utility
Holding Company Act.

         (a)   The Borrower is not engaged and will not engage, principally or
as one of its important activities, in the business of purchasing or carrying
margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U issued by the FRB), or
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock and no
proceeds of any Borrowings or drawings under any Letter of Credit will be used
to purchase or carry any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any margin stock in violation of Regulation U.

         (b)   None of the Borrower, the Parent Guarantor, or any Material
Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor is an "investment company" or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

         (c)   The Borrower and the Parent Guarantor are exempt from
registration and all other regulations and requirements of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 ("PUHCA") and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, other than Section 9(a)(2) thereof, pursuant to Section 3(a)(1) of
the 1935 Act except where the failure to be exempt could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All Subsidiaries of the Parent
Guarantor that hold "exempt wholesale generator" status continue to meet the
eligibility requirements for "exempt wholesale generator" status under Section
32 of PUHCA, except where failure to meet such eligibility requirements could
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Parent
Guarantor and its Subsidiary Illinova are exempt "holding companies" under
Section 3(a) of PUHCA, and Illinois Power Company, a Subsidiary of Illinova, is
a "public-utility company" except where the failure to be exempt could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (d)   Neither the making of any Loan, nor the issuance of any Letters
of Credit, nor the application of the proceeds or repayment thereof by the
Borrower, nor the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by the
Loan Documents, will violate any provision of any Act referred to in Section
5.14(b) or (c) above or any rule, regulation or order of the SEC thereunder.

         (e)   All "qualifying facilities" owned by the Parent Guarantor or any

Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and related regulations, except where failure to
meet such eligibility requirements could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         5.15. Disclosure. To the best knowledge of the executive officers of
the Borrower as of the date hereof, the written information furnished by or on
behalf of any Loan Party to any Agent or any Lender in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, reports,
financial statements and certificates) and the negotiation of this Agreement or
delivered hereunder or any other Loan Document (as modified or supplemented by
other information so furnished), when taken as a whole together with the Parent
Guarantor or the Borrower's Public Disclosure and any Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or
Form 8-K filed by the Parent Guarantor or the Borrower after the Closing Date
(as updated from time to

                                       94

<PAGE>

time) and after taking into account the updating of information in writing from
time to time in connection with this transaction do not contain any material
misstatement of fact or omit to state any material facts necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial
information, the Borrower and the Parent Guarantor represent only that such
information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed to be
reasonable at the time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
preceding sentence, no representation, warranty or covenant is made with respect
to information for which the source is any separately identified (x) third party
source or (y) other person or entity not affiliated with or acting as agent or
representative for the Parent Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries own, or possess the right to use, all of the trademarks, service
marks, trade names, copyrights, patents, patent rights, franchises, licenses and
other intellectual property rights (collectively, "IP Rights") that are
reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, without
conflict with the rights of any other Person except where the failure to own or
possess could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. To
the best knowledge of the Borrower and the Parent Guarantor, no slogan or other
advertising device, product, process, method, substance, part or other material
now employed, or now contemplated to be employed, by any Loan Party or any
Subsidiary (other than Excluded Subsidiaries and Discontinued Foreign
Subsidiaries) infringes upon any rights held by any other Person, except for any
such infringement that if litigated could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Affect.

         5.17. Solvency. To the best knowledge and belief of the Parent
Guarantor, each Loan Party (other than any Immaterial Subsidiary) is,
individually and together with its Subsidiaries, Solvent.

which restricted its ability to enter into the Guaranty or the Collateral
Documents or (2) prohibited by Laws from entering into the Guaranty or the
Collateral Documents ceasing to be subject to such restrictions or prohibitions,
(x) the identification of any material asset owned by a Loan Party (other than

interest in favor of the Collateral Agent or the Collateral Trustees, as
appropriate, for the benefit of the appropriate Secured Parties; then unless in
the case of an asset described in clauses (x) and (z) that is also a Restricted
Asset, the Parent Guarantor shall, in each case at the Borrower's expense:

           (i)    within 30 days after the occurrence of the events described in
     clause (v), (w) or (y), cause each such affected Subsidiary to duly execute
     and deliver to the Administrative Agent a Guaranty or Guaranty Supplement,

     satisfactory to the Administrative Agents and the Collateral Agent,

     satisfactory to the Administrative Agents, securing payment of all the
     Obligations of the applicable Loan Party under the Loan Documents and
     constituting Liens on all such assets,

          (iv)   within 60 days after such notice, occurrence, formation or
     acquisition, take, and cause such affected Subsidiary or the parent of such
     affected (or in the case of real property, the portion of such obligations
     equal to the value of such real property) Subsidiary to take, whatever
     action (including, without limitation, the recording of mortgages, the
     filing of Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, the giving of
     notices and the endorsement of notices on title documents) may be necessary
     or advisable in the opinion of the Administrative Agent to vest in the

     Guaranty Supplement or applicable Collateral Document, being valid and
     binding obligations of each Loan Party party thereto enforceable in
     accordance with their terms, as to the matters contained in clause (iv)
     above, as to such recordings, filings, notices, endorsements and other
     actions being sufficient to create valid perfected Liens on such
     properties, and as to such other matters as the Administrative Agents may
     reasonably request,

          (vi)   as promptly as practicable after such notice, occurrence,
     formation or acquisition, deliver, upon the request of the Administrative
     Agents and the Collateral Agent in their sole discretion, to the
     Administrative Agents and the Collateral Agent with respect to each parcel

     that is the subject of such occurrence, request, formation or acquisition
     title reports, surveys and other similar reports, each in scope, form and
     substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agents and the Collateral
     Agent; provided, however, that to the extent that any Loan Party or any of
     its Subsidiaries shall have otherwise received any of the foregoing items
     with respect to such real property, such items shall, promptly after the
     receipt thereof, be delivered to the Administrative Agents and the
     Collateral Agent, and

          (vii)  at any time and from time to time, promptly execute and deliver
     any and all further instruments and documents and take all such other
     action as the Administrative Agents and the Collateral Agent may reasonably
     deem necessary or desirable in obtaining

                                      103

<PAGE>

     the full benefits of, or in perfecting and preserving the Liens of, such
     Guaranties, Guaranty Supplements and Collateral Documents;

provided, however, that this Section 6.12 shall not be applicable to (A) the
extent that the grant or perfection of a Lien on the Equity Interests in a
Subsidiary or on the assets of the Borrower, the Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary or the entering into of a Guaranty or Guaranty Supplement would
require waiver, approval or consent from Governmental Authorities of, lenders,
service providers or suppliers to or co-owners, partners, investors, customers
or other contractual counterparties of a Person in which the Parent Guarantor or
any of its Subsidiaries has a direct or indirect Equity Interest, (B) a
Subsidiary that is a controlled foreign corporation as provided in Section 957
of the Code or that is directly or indirectly owned in part by a Person not,
directly or indirectly, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor or (C)
any Subsidiary or assets that do not have a fair market value of more than
$5,000,000.

           6.13.  Compliance with Environmental Laws. Except as set forth in
Public Disclosure filed at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date or as
set forth in Schedule 5.09 or except as could not, either individually or in the
aggregate be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect: comply, and
cause all lessees and other Persons operating or occupying its properties to
comply, in all material respects, with all applicable Environmental Laws and
Environmental Permits; obtain and renew all Environmental Permits necessary for
its operations and properties; and conduct any investigation, study, sampling
and testing, required under Environmental Laws, and undertake any cleanup,
removal, remedial or other action, required under Environmental Laws, to remove
and clean up all Hazardous Materials from any of its properties; provided,
however, that neither the Parent Guarantor nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to undertake any such cleanup, removal, remedial or other action to the
extent that its obligation to do so is being contested in good faith and by
proper proceedings with diligence in bringing the matter to closure, appropriate
reserves are being maintained with respect to such circumstances, and any such
Hazardous Material do not and could not reasonably be expected to pose an
imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment.

           6.14.  Preparation of Environmental Reports. To the extent Borrower
or any Loan Party has the authority to conduct such assessments without
obtaining required consent from any other Person, at the request of the
Administrative Agents or Required Lenders, provide to the Lenders within 60 days
after such request, at the expense of the Borrower, an environmental site
assessment, soil or groundwater report for any of the properties described in
the Mortgages or for any properties not described in the Mortgages, if, with
respect to such properties not described in the Mortgages, any Loan Parties or
any of their Subsidiaries receive notice of any Environmental Action relating to
any such properties not described in the Mortgages, or the Required Lenders
determine that any properties not described in the Mortgages are, or are likely
to become, subject to any Environmental Liability. With respect to any
properties not described in the Mortgages that require consent from any other
person prior to conducting such assessment, Borrower shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain such consent and, if such consent is obtained, will conduct
the environmental assessment. If such consent is not granted, Borrower shall not
be required to conduct such assessment. Any environmental site assessment report
prepared pursuant to this Section 6.14 shall be prepared by an environmental
consulting firm acceptable to the Administrative Agent and shall indicate the
presence or

                                       104

<PAGE>

absence of Hazardous Materials affecting any subject property and the estimated
cost of any compliance, removal or remedial action required under Environmental
Laws. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Administrative
Agents determine at any time that a material risk exists that any such report
will not be provided within the time referred to above, the Administrative
Agents may retain an environmental consulting firm to prepare such report at the
expense of the Borrower, and, to the extent the Borrower has the right to grant
such authorization or to cause such Subsidiary to grant such authorization, the
Borrower hereby grants and agrees to cause any such Subsidiary that owns any
property described in such request to grant at the time of such request to the
Administrative Agents, the Lenders, such firm and any agents or representatives
thereof an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of tenants,
to enter onto their respective properties to undertake such an assessment.

           6.15.  Further Assurances. Promptly upon request by any Agent, or any
Lender through either Administrative Agent, (i) correct any material defect or
error that may be discovered in any Loan Document or in the execution,
acknowledgment, filing or recordation thereof, and (ii) do, execute,
acknowledge, deliver, record, re-record, file, re-file, register and re-register
any and all such further acts, deeds, certificates, assurances and other
instruments as any Agent, or any Lender through either Administrative Agent, may
reasonably require from time to time in order to carry out more effectively the
purposes of the Loan Documents.

           6.16.  Material Contracts. Perform and observe all the terms and
provisions of each Material Contract to be performed or observed by it, maintain
each such Material Contract in full force and effect, enforce each such Material
Contract in accordance with its terms, take all such action to such end as may
be from time to time requested by the Administrative Agents and, upon request of
the Administrative Agents, make to each other party to each such Material
Contract such demands and requests for information and reports or for action as
any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled to make under such
Material Contract, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to do so, except, in any
case described in this Section 6.16, where the failure to do so, either
individually or in the aggregate, could not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

           6.17.  Upstreaming of Net Cash Proceeds and Extraordinary Receipts by
Subsidiaries. Cause any of its Subsidiaries (other than Illinois Power Company
and its Subsidiaries) who have received Net Cash Proceeds or Extraordinary
Receipts in connection with a transaction contemplated by Section 2.05(b) to
transfer such Net Cash Proceeds or Extraordinary Receipts, as the case may be,
to the Borrower or another Loan Party; provided that such transfer shall not be
required to be made if, and to the extent, such transfer would violate any
applicable Payment Restriction or applicable Law, or if any Payment Restriction
or applicable Law would (i) require minority owner approval (it being understood
that the Parent Guarantor shall use reasonable efforts to obtain such minority
owner approval) or (ii) involve, in the Parent Guarantor's good faith
determination or the good faith determination of a majority of the governing
body of such Subsidiary, a reasonable likelihood of there being a breach of
fiduciary duties by the governing body of such Subsidiary.

           6.18.  Mortgaged Property. Within 45 days following the Closing Date,

                                       105

Guarantor and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as would be obtainable by
the Parent Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time in a comparable arm's length
transaction or series of related transactions with a Person other than an
Affiliate; and enter into any transaction of any kind with any Affiliate of the

     thereof pursuant to Section 4.01 or 6.12 shall for any reason (other than
     pursuant to the terms thereof or hereof) cease to create a valid and
     perfected lien on and security interest in any material portion of the
     Collateral.

          8.02. Remedies Upon Event of Default.

                                       130

<PAGE>

          (a)   Termination of Commitments. If any Event of Default occurs and
     is continuing, the Administrative Agents shall (i), at the request of, or
     may, with the consent of, the Required Revolving Credit Lenders, declare
     the commitment of each Lender to make Revolving Credit Loans and any
     obligation of the L/C Issuer to make Revolving L/C Credit Extensions to be
     terminated, whereupon such commitments and obligation shall be terminated
     or (ii) at the request of, or may, with the consent of, the Required
     Reallocated Lenders, declare the commitment of each Lender to make
     Reallocated Facility Loans and any obligation of the L/C Issuer to make
     Reallocated L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated, whereupon such
     commitments and obligation shall be terminated;

          (b)   Acceleration and other Remedies. If any Event of Default occurs
     and is continuing, the Administrative Agents shall, at the request of, or
     may, with the consent of, the Required Section 8.01 Lenders, take any or
     all of the following actions: (i) declare the unpaid principal amount of
     all outstanding Loans, all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all
     other amounts owing or payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document
     to be immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
     other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
     Borrower;

          (ii)  require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations
     (in an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount thereof); and

          (iii) exercise on behalf of itself, the other Agents and the Lenders
     all rights and remedies available to it, the other Agents and the Lenders
     under the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all of the
     Collateral Documents) or applicable Law;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an
order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the
United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any obligation of
the L/C Issuer to make Revolving L/C Credit Extensions and Reallocated L/C
Credit Extensions shall automatically terminate, the unpaid principal amount of
all outstanding Loans and all interest and other amounts as aforesaid shall
automatically become due and payable, and the obligation of the Borrower to Cash
Collateralize the L/C Obligations as aforesaid shall automatically become
effective, in each case without further act of any Agent or any Lender.

          8.03. Application of Monies Upon Event of Default. Upon an Event of
Default, any monies received by any Agent shall be applied to the Obligations,
subject to the priorities set forth in the Collateral Trust Agreement, in the
following order of priority:

                (i) first, to costs and expenses owed to the Agents and the L/C
          Issuer, ratably in accordance with such respective costs and expenses
          then owing to the Agents and the L/C Issuer;

                (ii) second, to fees and interest owed to the Lenders, ratably
          in accordance with such respective fees and interest then owing to the
          Lenders; and

                                       131

<PAGE>

                (iii) third, ratably to payments of principal (and Cash
          Collateralization of Letters of Credit).

          8.04. Other Agreements Among Lenders. Notwithstanding anything in the
Shared Collateral Documents to the contrary, and only as between the Lenders and
the Administrative Agents, (i) until all Obligations of the Loan Parties in
respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term A Facility and the
Reallocated Facility have been fully paid and the Revolving Committed Amount has
been permanently reduced to zero ($0), and all L/C Obligations have been repaid
in full or Cash Collateralized, the Junior Secured Parties (as defined in the
Collateral Trust Agreement) shall not be entitled to exercise (or to direct the
Administrative Agents to exercise) any remedies under the Shared Collateral
Documents, including without limitation the right to enforce any Liens
thereunder, institute proceedings with respect to Collateral thereunder, notice
account debtors thereunder, make collections with respect to Collateral
thereunder, or sell or otherwise foreclose on any portion of the Collateral
thereunder and (ii) until the date 91 days after all Obligations of the Loan
Parties in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Term A Facility and the
Reallocated Facility have been fully paid, the Revolving Credit Commitment has
been permanently reduced to zero ($0), and all L/C Obligations have been repaid
in full or Cash Collateralized, none of the Junior Secured Parties (as defined
in the Collateral Trust Agreement) shall take any action, directly or
indirectly, to initiate an involuntary bankruptcy or receivership proceeding or
receivership in respect of any Loan Party. Further upon the occurrence of any
event described in Section 8.01(f) with respect to any Loan Party, (a) all
references herein to such Loan Party shall be deemed to apply to such entity as
debtor in possession and to any trustee in bankruptcy for the estate of such
entity, (b) the Required Section 8.01 Lenders shall have the right, on behalf of
the Junior Secured Parties, to direct the Administrative Agents to contest or
consent to (i) the use of cash collateral by the applicable Loan Party, (ii) the
disposition of assets by the applicable Loan Party under Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code and (iii) the granting of a priming Lien to secure postpetition
financing in a principal amount not to exceed $200,000,000 (less any increases
in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Term A
Commitments and the Reallocated Facility Commitments after the date hereof)
provided pursuant to Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, and no Junior Secured
Party shall contest the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or such
actions, or the Administrative Agents or the Secured Parties receiving a Lien or
being granted an administrative claim in connection with adequate protection,
use of cash collateral or post-petition financing consistent with this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents under Sections 361, 363, or 364 of the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to such obligations, and (c) each Secured Party agrees that
the obligations of the Secured Parties under this Agreement shall continue to be
effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, as to any payment in respect of
any Secured Obligations that are rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the
holder of such Secured Obligations upon the occurrence or as a result of
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, all as though such payment had not
been made.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                     ADMINISTRATIVE AGENTS AND OTHER AGENTS

          9.01. Appointment and Authorization of Agents.

                                       132

<PAGE>

          (a)   Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and
authorizes each Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, no Agent shall have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor
shall any Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or otherwise exist against any Agent. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in
the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote
any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between independent contracting parties.

          (b)   The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect
to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith,
and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to
the Agents in this Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions
suffered by the L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or
proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of
credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Agent" as
used in this Article IX and in the definition of "Agent-Related Person" included
the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally
provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.

          (c)   Each of the Lenders (in its capacities as a Lender and L/C
Issuer (if applicable)) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Collateral Agent to act as the agent and as the representative of such Lender
for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing any and all Liens on Collateral
granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Secured Obligations,
together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto.
In this connection, the Collateral Agent (and any co-agents, sub-agents and
attorneys-in-fact appointed by the Collateral Agent or by either Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 9.02 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on
the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Collateral Documents,
or for exercising any rights and remedies thereunder at the direction of the
Collateral Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all provisions of this
Article IX (including, without limitation, Section 9.07, as though such
co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the "collateral agent" under
the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect thereto.

          9.02. Delegation of Duties. Any Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including for purposes of
holding or enforcing any Lien on the Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted
under the Collateral Documents or of exercising any rights and remedies
thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agents) by or through agents,
employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel and
other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.
No Agent shall be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or
attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

                                       133

<PAGE>

          9.03. Liability of Agents. No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable
for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them under or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct
in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible
in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital, statement,
representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer thereof,
contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by any
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the perfection or priority of any Lien
or security interest created or purported to be created under the Collateral
Documents, or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan
Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related
Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain
or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements
contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to
inspect the properties, books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate
thereof.

          9.04. Reliance by Agents.

          (a)   Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature, resolution,
representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram,
facsimile, telex or telephone message, electronic mail message, statement or
other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party),
independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. Each Agent
shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any
Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability
and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in
acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders (or
such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly required hereby in any
instance) and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. The Lenders hereby acknowledge
that each Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary action
permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by the
Required Lenders. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

          (b)   For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the

                                       134

<PAGE>

Administrative Agents shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the
proposed Closing Date specifying its objection thereto.

          9.05. Notice of Default. No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Payment Agent
for the account of the Lenders, unless such Agent shall have received written
notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing
such Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default." The
Administrative Agents will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.
The Administrative Agents shall take such action, or direct the Collateral Agent
to take such action or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article
VIII; provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agents or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, have received any such direction, the
Administrative Agents or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may (but
shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such Default as they shall deem advisable or in the best
interest of the Lenders.

          9.06. Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agents. Each
Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any representation or
warranty to it, and that no act by any Agent hereafter taken, including any
consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan
Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation
or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender as to any matter,
including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed material information in
their possession. Each Lender represents to each Agent that it has,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties
and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory
Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision
to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower and the other
Loan Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently
and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Loan Parties. Except for notices,
reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by
any Agent herein, such Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

          9.07. Indemnification of Agents. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand
each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of any
Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan Party to do so), pro
rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no

                                       135

<PAGE>

Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any
portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken by any Agent-Related Person in
accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders, and no action taken or
refrained from being taken by the Collateral Agent at the direction of an
Administrative Agent, shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. In the case of any investigation,
litigation or proceeding giving rise to any Indemnified Liabilities, this
Section 9.07 applies whether any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is
brought by any Lender or any other Person. As used herein, "Indemnified
Liabilities" for each Agent-Related Person means (i) any amounts not reimbursed
by the Borrower for which such Agent-Related Person is entitled to reimbursement
by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) any other expenses incurred by
such Agent-Related Person on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan
Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by such
Agent-Related Person in connection with any dispute between such Agent-Related
Person and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) any
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against such Agent-Related Person in any way
relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or any other document delivered
in connection therewith or the transactions contemplated thereby (including,
without limitation, for any such amounts incurred by or asserted against such
Agent-Related Person in connection with any dispute between such Agent-Related
Person and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the enforcement
of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other documents.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse each Agent and
L/C Issuer upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket
expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by such Agent in connection with
the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein,
to the extent that such Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on
behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations
and the resignation of such Agent.

          9.08. Agents in their Individual Capacities. Citibank, Bank of America
and Bank One and their respective Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire Equity Interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates
as though Citibank, Bank of America and Bank One were not an Agent hereunder and
without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that,
pursuant to such activities, Citibank, Bank of America, Bank One or their
respective Affiliates may receive information regarding any Loan Party or its
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that
no Agent shall be under any obligation to provide such information to them. With
respect to its Loans, each of Citibank, Bank of America and Bank One shall have
the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may
exercise such rights and

                                       136

<PAGE>

powers as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
include each of Citibank, Bank of America and Bank One in its individual
capacity.

          9.09. Successor Agents. Any Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days'
notice to the Lenders. If any Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required
Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders,
which successor agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at all times other
than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor agent is
appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation of such Agent, such
Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a
successor agent from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment
as successor agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor agent shall
succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the retiring Agent and the terms
"Administrative Agent" and "Collateral Agent" shall mean such successor
administrative agent and collateral agent and the retiring Agent's appointment,
powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's
resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Article IX and Sections
11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was an Agent under this Agreement. If no successor agent
has accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a
retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the
duties of such Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor and upon the execution and filing
or recording of such financing statements, or amendments thereto, and such
amendments or supplements to the Mortgages, and such other instruments or
notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as the Required Lenders may
request, in order to continue the perfection of the Liens granted or purported
to be granted by the Collateral Documents, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, discretion,
privileges, and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. After any
retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this
Article IX shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an Agent.

          9.10. Administrative Agents May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agents (irrespective
of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agents shall have made any demand on the Borrower)
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise

          (a)   to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
     and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and
     all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
     documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
     the Lenders and the Agents (including any claim for the reasonable
     compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the
     Agents and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due
     the Lenders and

                                       137

<PAGE>

     the Agents under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 11.04) allowed in such
     judicial proceeding; and


          (b)   to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
     deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agents and, in the event
that the Administrative Agents shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agents any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agents
and their respective agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Agents
under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.

          Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the
Administrative Agents to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of
any Lender any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the
Administrative Agents to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such
proceeding.

          9.11. Collateral and Guaranty Matters.

          (a)   The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Collateral Agent, at its
option and in its discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted to or
held by the Collateral Trustees or the Collateral Agent under any Loan Document
(i) upon termination of the Aggregate Commitments and payment in full of all
Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations not yet accrued
and payable) and the expiration or termination of all Letters of Credit, (ii)
that is sold or to be sold as part of or in connection with any sale permitted
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (iii) subject to Section 11.01,
if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the Required Lenders.

          (b)   The Lenders irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agents, at
their option and in their discretion, to release any Guarantor from its
obligations under the Guaranty if such Person ceases to be a Subsidiary as a
result of a transaction permitted hereunder.

          (c)   Upon request by the Collateral Agent or the Administrative
Agents, as the case may be, at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in
writing the authority of the Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agents, as
applicable, to release its interest in particular types or items of property, or
to release any Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty pursuant to
this Section 9.11. In each case as specified in this Section 9.11, the
Collateral Agent or the Administrative Agents, as the case may be, will, at the
Borrower's expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such
documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of
such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under
the Collateral Documents, or to release such Guarantor from its obligations
under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents and this Section 9.11.

                                       138

<PAGE>

          9.12. Other Agents; Arrangers and Managers. None of the Lenders or
other Persons identified on the facing page or signature pages of this Agreement
as a "syndication agent," "documentation agent," "co-agent," "book manager,"
"lead manager," "arranger," "lead arranger" or "co-arranger" shall have any
right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement
other than, in the case of such Lenders, those applicable to all Lenders as
such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders or other Persons so
identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on
any of the Lenders or other Persons so identified in deciding to enter into this
Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

          9.13. Appointment of Supplemental Collateral Agents.

          (a)   It is the purpose of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
that there shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or
restricting the right of banking corporations or associations to transact
business as agent or trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case
of litigation under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and in
particular in case of the enforcement of any of the Loan Documents, or in case
the Administrative Agents deem that by reason of any present or future law of
any jurisdiction it may not exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies
granted herein or in any of the other Loan Documents or take any other action
which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary
that the Administrative Agents appoint an additional individual or institution
as a separate trustee, co-trustee, collateral agent, collateral sub-agent or
collateral co-agent (any such additional individual or institution being
referred to herein individually as a "Supplemental Collateral Agent" and
collectively as "Supplemental Collateral Agents").

          (b)   In the event that the Administrative Agents appoint a
Supplemental Collateral Agent with respect to any Collateral, (i) each and every
right, power, privilege or duty expressed or intended by this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents to be exercised by or vested in or conveyed to the
Administrative Agents with respect to such Collateral shall be exercisable by
and vest in such Supplemental Collateral Agent to the extent, and only to the
extent, necessary to enable such Supplemental Collateral Agent to exercise such
rights, powers and privileges with respect to such Collateral and to perform
such duties with respect to such Collateral, and every covenant and obligation
contained in the Loan Documents and necessary to the exercise or performance
thereof by such Supplemental Collateral Agent shall run to and be enforceable by
either the Administrative Agents or such Supplemental Collateral Agents, and
(ii) the provisions of this Article and of Section 11.04 that refer to the
Administrative Agent shall inure to the benefit of such Supplemental Collateral
Agent and all references therein to the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to
be references to the Administrative Agents and/or such Supplemental Collateral
Agent, as the context may require.

          (c)   Should any instrument in writing from any Loan Party be required
by any Supplemental Collateral Agent so appointed by the Administrative Agents
for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such rights,
powers, privileges and duties, such Loan Party shall execute, acknowledge and
deliver any and all such instruments promptly upon request by the Administrative
Agents. In case any Supplemental Collateral Agent, or a successor thereto, shall
die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all the rights, powers,

                                       139

<PAGE>

privileges and duties of such Supplemental Collateral Agent, to the extent
permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Administrative Agents
until the appointment of a new Supplemental Collateral Agent.

                                    GUARANTY

          10.01. Guaranty; Limitation of Liability.

          (a)    Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due,
whether at scheduled maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by
acceleration, demand or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under or in respect of the Loan Documents and of all ACH
Obligations (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications,
substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing
Obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether
for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action,
costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the "Guaranteed
Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by any Agent or any other
Secured Party in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty or any other Loan
Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor's
liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed
Obligations and would be owed by any other Loan Party to any Secured Party under
or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable
or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar
proceeding involving such other Loan Party.

          (b)    Each Guarantor, and by its acceptance of this Guaranty, the
Administrative Agents and each other Secured Party, hereby confirms that it is
the intention of all such Persons that this Guaranty and the Obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for
purposes of Debtor Relief Laws, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign, federal or state law to
the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor
hereunder. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Administrative Agents, the
other Secured Parties and the Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the
Obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall
be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such
Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance.

          (c)    Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to any Secured Party
under this Guaranty or any Guaranty Supplement, such Guarantor will contribute,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, such amounts to each other Additional
Guarantor and each other Guarantor so as to maximize the aggregate amount paid
to the Secured Parties under or in respect of the Loan Documents.

          10.02. Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in
effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such

                                       140

<PAGE>

terms or the rights of any Secured Party with respect thereto. The Obligations
of each Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the
Guaranteed Obligations or any other Obligations of any other Loan Party under or
in respect of the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be
brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty,
irrespective of whether any action is brought against the Borrower or any other
Loan Party or whether the Borrower or any other Loan Party is joined in any such
action or actions. The liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be
irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor
hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in
any way relating to, any or all of the following:

          (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or any
     agreement or instrument relating thereto;

          (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
     other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
     Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect of the Loan
     Documents, or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure
     from any Loan Document, including, without limitation, any increase in the
     Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the extension of additional credit to
     any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

          (c) any taking, exchange, release or non-perfection of any Collateral
     or any other collateral, or any taking, release or amendment or waiver of,
     or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for all or any of the
     Guaranteed Obligations;

          (d) any manner of application of Collateral or any other collateral,
     or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any
     manner of sale or other disposition of any Collateral or any other
     collateral for all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other
     Obligations of any Loan Party under the Loan Documents or any other assets
     of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

          (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
     structure or existence of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

          (f) any failure of any Secured Party to disclose to any Loan Party any
     information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
     operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party
     now or hereafter known to such Secured Party (each Guarantor waiving any
     duty on the part of the Secured Parties to disclose such information);

          (g) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this
     Guaranty, any Guaranty Supplement or any other guaranty or agreement or the
     release or reduction of liability of any Guarantor or other guarantor or
     surety with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations; or

          (h) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute
     of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by
     any Secured Party that might otherwise constitute a defense available to,
     or a discharge of, any Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety.

                                       141

This Guaranty shall survive termination of this Agreement and shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of
any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
any Secured Party or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or
reorganization of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or otherwise, all as
though such payment had not been made.

          10.03. Waivers and Acknowledgments.

          (a)    Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for
performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or
dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations
and this Guaranty and any requirement that any Secured Party protect, secure,
perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto or exhaust any right
or take any action against any Loan Party or any other Person or any Collateral.

          (b)    Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is
continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing
now or in the future.

          (c)    Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
(i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election
of remedies by any Secured Party that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases
or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration,
contribution or indemnification rights of such Guarantor or other rights of such
Guarantor to proceed against any of the other Loan Parties, any other guarantor
or any other Person or any Collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of
set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the Obligations of such
Guarantor hereunder.

          (d)    Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Collateral Agent may,
without notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without affecting the
liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, foreclose under any mortgage by
nonjudicial sale, and each Guarantor hereby waives any defense to the recovery
by the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties against such Guarantor of
any deficiency after such nonjudicial sale and any defense or benefits that may
be afforded by applicable law.

          (e)    Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives
any duty on the part of any Secured Party to disclose to such Guarantor any
matter, fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan
Party or any of its Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by such Secured Party.

          (f)    Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by the
Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth in Section 10.02 and this Section
10.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

          10.04. Subrogation. Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter
acquire against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other insider
guarantor that arise from the existence, payment,

                                       142

<PAGE>

performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's Obligations under or in respect
of this Guaranty or any other Loan Document, including, without limitation, any
right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of any
Secured Party against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other insider
guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises
in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without
limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrower, any other Loan Party
or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or other
property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of
such claim, remedy or right, unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations
and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full
in cash, all Letters of Credit shall have expired or been terminated and the
Commitments shall have expired or been terminated. If any amount shall be paid
to any Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time
prior to the latest of (a) the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) the Maturity
Date in respect of the Term B Facility and (c) the latest date of expiration or
termination of all Letters of Credit, such amount shall be received and held in
trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties, shall be segregated from other
property and funds of such Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to
the Administrative Agents in the same form as so received (with any necessary
endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed
Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured
or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, or to be held
as Collateral for any Guaranteed Obligations or other amounts payable under this
Guaranty thereafter arising. If (i) any Guarantor shall make payment to any
Secured Party of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) all of the
Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall
have been paid in full in cash, (iii) the Maturity Date in respect of the Term B
Facility shall have occurred and (iv) all Letters of Credit shall have expired
or been terminated, the Secured Parties will, at such Guarantor's request and
expense, execute and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without
recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the
transfer by subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed
Obligations resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this
Guaranty.

          10.05. Guaranty Supplements. Upon the execution and delivery by any
Additional Subsidiary Guarantor of a guaranty supplement in substantially the
form of Exhibit I hereto (each, a "Guaranty Supplement"), (a) such Person shall

Guarantor, and each reference in any other Loan Document to a "Subsidiary

          10.06. Subordination. Each Guarantor hereby subordinates any and all
debts, liabilities and other obligations owed to such Guarantor by each other
Loan Party other than any existing Indebtedness indicated by an asterisk on
Schedule 7.03 (the "Subordinated

                                       143

<PAGE>

Obligations") to the Guaranteed Obligations to the extent and in the manner
hereinafter set forth in this Section 10.06:

          (a)    Prohibited Payments, Etc. Except during the continuance of a
     Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding
     under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any other Loan Party), each
     Guarantor may receive regularly scheduled payments from any other Loan
     Party on account of the Subordinated Obligations. After the occurrence and
     during the continuance of any Default (including the commencement and
     continuation of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any
     other Loan Party), however, unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no
     Guarantor shall demand, accept or take any action to collect any payment on
     account of the Subordinated Obligations.

          (b)    Prior Payment of Guaranteed Obligations. In any proceeding
     under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any other Loan Party, each
     Guarantor agrees that the Secured Parties shall be entitled to receive
     payment in full in cash of all Guaranteed Obligations (including all
     interest and expenses accruing after the commencement of a proceeding under
     any Debtor Relief Law, whether or not constituting an allowed claim in such
     proceeding ("Post-Petition Interest")) before such Guarantor receives
     payment of any Subordinated Obligations.

          (c)    Turn-Over. After the occurrence and during the continuance of
     any Default (including the commencement and continuation of any proceeding
     under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any other Loan Party), each
     Guarantor shall, if the Administrative Agents so request, collect, enforce
     and receive payments on account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee
     for the Secured Parties and deliver such payments to the Administrative
     Agents on account of the Guaranteed Obligations (including all
     Post-Petition Interest), together with any necessary endorsements or other
     instruments of transfer, but without reducing or affecting in any manner
     the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this
     Guaranty.

          (d)    Administrative Agents Authorization. After the occurrence and
     during the continuance of any Default (including the commencement and
     continuation of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any
     other Loan Party), the Administrative Agents are authorized and empowered
     (but without any obligation to so do), in its discretion, (i) in the name
     of each Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect
     of, Subordinated Obligations and to apply any amounts received thereon to
     the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all Post-Petition Interest),
     and (ii) to require each Guarantor (A) to collect and enforce, and to
     submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and (B) to pay any
     amounts received on such obligations to the Administrative Agents for
     application to the Guaranteed Obligations (including any and all
     Post-Petition Interest).

          10.07. Continuing Guaranty; Assignments. This Guaranty is a continuing
guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the latest of (i)
the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts
payable under this Guaranty, (ii) the Maturity Date in respect of the Term B
Facility and (iii) the latest date of expiration or

<PAGE>

termination of all Letters of Credit, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its
successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Secured Parties and their successors, transferees and assigns. Upon the
occurrence of the latest date specified in clause (a) above, the Guarantors
shall be released from other Obligations under the Loan Documents. Without
limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, any
Secured Party may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights
and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or any
portion of its Commitments, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes held
by it) to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested
with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Secured Party herein or
otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in this Section 10.07. No
Guarantor shall have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest
herein without the prior written consent of the Secured Parties.

          10.08. Subordination of Obligations and Exercise of Remedies to Black
Thunder Facility. All Obligations under this Guaranty and the other Loan
Documents of Dynegy Midwest Generation, Inc. and its Subsidiaries owing to the
Lenders and the exercise of remedies with respect to Dynegy Midwest Generation,
Inc. or any of its properties shall be subordinated to the obligations and
rights of Dynegy Midwest Generation, Inc. and such Subsidiaries owing to the

Party, as the case may be, and acknowledged by each Administrative Agent that
Lenders constituting the Required Lenders have approved such amendment or
waiver, and each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that
no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

     without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby;
     provided, however, that only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be
     necessary to change clause (c) of the definition of "Default Rate";

          (e) change the order of application of any reduction in the
     Commitments or any prepayment of Loans between the Facilities from the

Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The effectiveness of
any such documents and signatures shall, subject to applicable Law, have the
same force and effect as manually-signed originals and shall be binding on all
Loan Parties, the Agents and the Lenders. The Administrative Agents may also
require that any such documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed
original thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the
same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or signature.

          (c)    Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet
and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine communications,
such as financial statements and other information as provided in Sections 6.01
and 6.02, and to distribute Loan Documents for execution by the parties thereto,
and may not be used for any other purpose.

          (d)    Reliance by Agents and Lenders. The Agents and the Lenders
shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic
Committed Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower even
if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete
or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein,
or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any
confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent-Related Person and
each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the
reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other communications with any Agent may
be recorded by such Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to
such recording.

          11.03. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure by any Lender or any
Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right,
remedy, power or privilege hereunder or any other Loan Document shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other
Loan Document, are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers
and privileges provided by law.

          11.04. Costs and Expenses. The Borrower agrees (a) to pay or reimburse
each Agent and L/C Issuer for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the development, preparation, negotiation, syndication and
execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and any amendment,
waiver, consent or other modification of the provisions hereof and thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby are
consummated), and the consummation and administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including all Attorney Costs, and other
professionals retained and (b) to pay or reimburse each Agent and each Lender
for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of any
rights or remedies under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (including
all such costs and expenses incurred during any legal proceeding, including any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law), including all Attorney Costs. The
foregoing costs and

                                       148

<PAGE>

expenses shall include all search, filing, recording, title insurance and
appraisal charges and fees and taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by any Agent and the cost of independent public accountants
and other outside experts retained by any Agent. All amounts due under this
Section 11.04 shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand therefor.
The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Aggregate
Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations. If any Loan Party fails to
pay when due any costs, expenses or other amounts payable by it hereunder or
under any Loan Document, including, without limitation, Attorney Costs and
indemnities, such amount may be paid on behalf of such Loan Party by any Agent
or any Lender, in its sole discretion.

          11.05. Release and Indemnification by the Borrower and the Parent
Guarantor.

          (a)    Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Borrower and the Parent Guarantor hereby, jointly and
severally, unconditionally release and forever discharge each Agent-Related
Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns,
agents, directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, contractors,
advisors and attorneys (collectively, the "Indemnitees") from all Claims and
jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Indemnitees, and hold them harmless
from any and all claims, losses, causes of action, costs and expenses of every
kind or character in connection with the Claims. As used in this Agreement, the
term "Claims" shall mean any and all possible claims, demands, actions, causes
of actions, costs, expenses and liabilities whatsoever, known or unknown, at law
or in equity, originating in whole or in part, which the Borrower or the Parent
Guarantor, or any of their agents, employees or affiliates may now or hereafter
have or claim against any of the Indemnitees and irrespective of whether any
such Claims arise out of contract, tort, strict liability, violation of Law or
otherwise in connection with any of the Loan Documents and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto, in all cases, whether or not caused by or
arising, in whole or in part, out of the negligence of the Indemnitee; provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent
that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The
Borrower and the Parent Guarantor, jointly and severally, agree that none of the
Indemnitees have fiduciary or similar obligations to the Borrower or the Parent
Guarantor and that their relationships are strictly that of creditor and debtor.
This release is accepted by each Lender pursuant to this Agreement and shall not
be construed as an admission of liability by any Lender or any other Indemnitee.
No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by others of
any information or other materials obtained through IntraLinks or other similar
information transmission systems in connection with this Agreement, nor shall
any Indemnitee have any liability for any indirect or consequential damages
relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or arising out of its
activities in connection herewith or therewith (whether before or after the
Closing Date). In the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding
to which the indemnity in this Section 11.05 applies, such indemnity shall be
effective whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought
by any Loan Party, its directors, shareholders or creditors or an Indemnitee or
any other Person, whether or not any Indemnitee is otherwise a party thereto and
whether or not any of the transactions contemplated hereunder or under any of
the other Loan Documents is consummated. All amounts due under this Section
11.05 shall be payable within ten Business Days after demand

                                       149

<PAGE>

therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the resignation of any
Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the Aggregate
Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the other
Obligations.

          (b)    THE BORROWER AND EACH GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS
AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS RELEASING EACH
INDEMNITEE FROM LIABILITY AND/OR INDEMNIFYING AND HOLDING HARMLESS EACH
INDEMNITEE FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INDEMNITEE'S OWN NEGLIGENCE. EACH OF THE
BORROWER AND THE PARENT GUARANTOR AGREES THAT THE RELEASE AND/OR INDEMNITY
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THESE DOCUMENTS ARE CAPTIONED TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY THE
RELEASE AND/OR INDEMNITY PROVISIONS AND, THEREFORE, ARE SO CONSPICUOUS THAT EACH
OF THE BORROWER AND THE PARENT GUARANTOR HAS FAIR NOTICE OF THE EXISTENCE AND
CONTENTS OF SUCH PROVISIONS. EACH OF THE BORROWER AND THE PARENT GUARANTOR
HEREBY WAIVES ANY DEFENSES IT MIGHT ASSERT AGAINST EACH INDEMNITEE BASED ON THE
HOLDING OF THE TEXAS SUPREME COURT IN ETHYL CORP. v. DANIEL CONST. CO., 725
S.W.2d 705 (Tex. 1987), PAGE PETROLEUM, INC., et al. V. DRESSER INDUSTRIES,
INC., et al., 853 S.W.2d 505 (Tex. 1993), AND QUORUM HEALTH RESOURCES, L.L.C. v.
MAVERICK COUNTY HOSPITAL DISTRICT et al., 308 F.3rd 451 (5th Cir. 2002) AND ANY
RELATED CASE LAW HOLDINGS.

          11.06. Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of any Loan Party is made to any Agent or any Lender, or any Agent or any
Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such
setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any
settlement entered into by such Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any
proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then to the extent
permitted by Law (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agents upon demand its applicable share of any amount so recovered from or
repaid by any Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the
date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate
from time to time in effect.

          11.07. Successors and Assigns.

          (a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an Eligible Assignee in accordance
with the provisions of Section 11.07(b), (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of Section 11.07(d), (iii) by way of pledge or
assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of Section
11.07(f) or (i), or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of

                                       150

<PAGE>

Section 11.07(h) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the
extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b)    Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more Eligible
Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
purposes of this Section 11.07(b), participations in Revolving L/C Obligations
and Reallocated L/C Obligations) at the time owing to it); provided that (i)
except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the
case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, the aggregate
amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
thereunder) or, if the applicable Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loan of the assigning Lender subject to
each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agents or, if
"Trade Date" is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 and increments of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof, unless each of the Administrative Agents and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
the Loans or the Commitment assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not
prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and
obligations among separate Facilities on a non-pro rata basis; and (iii) the
parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Payment Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Payment Agent
pursuant to Section 11.07(c), from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a
party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (other than delinquent obligations to the L/C
Issuer) (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender
shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 11.04 and 11.05 with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment). Upon
request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the
assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.07(d).

          (c)    The Payment Agents, acting solely for this purpose as an agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Payment Agent's Office a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the

                                       151

<PAGE>

Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans, the
Revolving L/C Obligations and the Reallocated L/C Obligations owing to, each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agents and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower, any Agent and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d)    Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice
to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agents, sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans (including such Lender's participations in
Revolving L/C Obligations and/or Reallocated L/C Obligations) owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Agents and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with
such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to Section
11.07(e), the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.07(b).
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 11.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender.

          (e)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
11.15 as though it were a Lender.

          (f)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its
Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no
such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.

          (g)    As used herein, the following terms have the following
meanings:

                                       152

<PAGE>

          "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) a commercial bank
     organized under the laws of the United States, or any State thereof, and
     having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000; (c) a
     savings and loan association or savings bank organized under the laws of
     the United States, or any State thereof, and having a combined capital and
     surplus of at least $250,000,000; (d) a commercial bank organized under the
     laws of any other country that is a member of the OECD or has concluded
     special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund
     associated with its General Arrangements to Borrow, or a political
     subdivision of any such country, and having a combined capital and surplus
     of at least $500,000,000 so long as such bank is acting through a branch or
     agency located in the United States; (e) the central bank of any country
     which is a member of the OECD; (f) a finance company, insurance company,
     investment bank or other financial institution or Fund (whether a
     corporation, partnership, trust or other entity) that is engaged in making,
     purchasing or otherwise investing in commercial loans in the ordinary
     course of its business and having a combined capital and surplus of at
     least $500,000,000; and (g) any other Person (other than a natural person)
     approved by (i) the Administrative Agents, (ii) in the case of any
     assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment or a Reallocated Commitment,
     the L/C Issuer, and (iii) unless an Event of Default has occurred and is
     continuing, the Borrower (each such approval not to be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
     "Eligible Assignee" shall (1) include, in the case of any assignment in
     respect of the Term A Facility or the Term B Facility, any Affiliate of a
     Lender and (2) not include (x) the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
     Affiliates or Subsidiaries and (y) in the case of any assignment of a
     Revolving Credit Commitment or a Reallocated Commitment, any such Person
     described in the case of clauses (b) through (f) not approved by the
     Payment Agent (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) and the L/C
     Issuer.

          (h)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle
identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the
Payment Agent and the Borrower (an "SPC") the option to provide all or any part
of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make
pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a
commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to
exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan,
the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms
hereof. Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to any SPC
nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses
or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.04), (ii) no SPC shall be
liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for
which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting Lender shall for all
purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver or other modification
of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender of record hereunder.
The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the
Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were made by such
Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that,
prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all
outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy,

                                       153

<PAGE>

reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding under the
laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without prior
consent of the Borrower and the Payment Agent and with the payment of a
processing fee of $3500, assign all or any portion of its right to receive
payment with respect to any Loan to the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a
confidential basis any non-public information relating to its funding of Loans
to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety or
Guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC.

          (i)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
Lender that is a Fund may create a security interest in all or any portion of
the Loans owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it to the trustee for
holders of obligations owed, or securities issued, by such Fund as security for
such obligations or securities, provided that unless and until such trustee
actually becomes a Lender in compliance with the other provisions of this
Section 11.07, (i) no such pledge shall release the pledging Lender from any of
its obligations under the Loan Documents and (ii) such trustee shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the rights of a Lender under the Loan Documents even
though such trustee may have acquired ownership rights with respect to the
pledged interest through foreclosure or otherwise.

          (j)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
at any time Bank One assigns all of its Commitments and Loans pursuant to
Section 11.07(b), Bank One may, upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower and the
Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer. In the event of any such resignation as L/C
Issuer, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a
successor L/C Issuer hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the
Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank One
as L/C Issuer. If Bank One resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights
and obligations of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of
Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and
all Revolving L/C Obligations and all Reallocated L/C Obligations with respect
thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or
fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Revolving Amounts pursuant to Section
2.03(c) or Unreimbursed Reallocated Amounts pursuant to Section 2.04(c)).

          11.08. Confidentiality.

          (a)    The Borrower, the Lenders and the Agents hereby agree that each
of the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents (and each of their respective,
and their respective affiliates', employees, officers, directors, agents,
accountants, attorneys and other advisors) is, and has been from the
commencement of discussions with respect to the Facilities, permitted to
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the "structure"
and "tax" "aspects" (as such terms are used in Code Sections 6011, 6111 and 6112
and the regulations promulgated thereunder) of the Facilities, and all materials
of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been
provided to the Loan Parties, such Lender or the Agents related to such
structure and tax aspects. In this regard, each of the Loan Parties, the Lenders
and the Agents acknowledges and agrees that its disclosure of the structure or
tax aspects of the Facilities is not limited in any way by an express or implied
understanding or agreement, oral or written (whether or not such understanding
or agreement is legally binding). Furthermore, each of the Loan Parties, the
Lenders and the Agents acknowledges and agrees that it does not know

                                       154

<PAGE>

or have reason to know that its use or disclosure of information relating to the
structure or tax aspects of the Facilities is limited in any other manner (such
as where the Facilities are claimed to be proprietary or exclusive) for the
benefit of any other Person. Each of the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the
Agents acknowledge and agree that the Facilities are not intended to be a
"confidential transaction" under such Code sections and regulations. To the
extent that disclosure of the structure or tax aspects of the Facilities by the
Loan Parties, the Agents or the Lenders is limited by any existing agreement
between a Loan Party and the Agents or the Lenders, such limitation is agreed to
be void ab initio and such agreement is hereby amended to permit disclosure of
the structure and tax aspects of the Facilities as provided in this paragraph
(a).

          (b)    Subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 11.08, neither any
Agent nor any Lender may disclose to any Person any confidential, proprietary or
non-public information of the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries furnished to
the Agents or the Lenders by any Loan Party (such information being referred to
collectively herein as the "Parent Information"), except that each of the Agents
and each of the Lenders may disclose Parent Information (i) to its and its
affiliates' employees, officers, directors, agents and other advisors, including
accountants and legal counsel (it being understood that the Persons to whom such
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Parent
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential on
substantially the same terms as provided herein), (ii) to the extent requested
by any regulatory authority, (iii) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any judicial order, subpoena or similar legal process or
requested by any regulatory body with jurisdiction over any of the Agents or
Lenders or their affiliates, employees, officers, directors, agents,
accountants, attorneys and other advisors, (iv) to any other party to this
Agreement, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or
under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section 11.08, to any assignee of or participant in, or
any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement, (vii) to the extent such Parent Information (A) is or
becomes generally available to the public on a non-confidential basis other than
as a result of a breach of this Section 11.08 by such Agent or such Lender, or
(B) is or becomes available to such Agent or such Lender on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than a Loan Party and (viii) with the consent of the
Borrower.

          11.09. Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
provided by law, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is authorized at
any time and from time to time, with prior notice to the Borrower or any other
Loan Party, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other Indebtedness at
any time owing by, such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the
respective Loan Parties against any and all Obligations owing to such Lender
hereunder or under any other Loan Document, now or hereafter existing,
irrespective of whether or not such Agent or such Lender shall have made demand
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such Obligations
may be contingent or unmatured or denominated in a currency different from that
of the applicable deposit or Indebtedness. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify
the Borrower, the Payment Agent and the Administrative Agents after any such
set-off and application made by

                                       155

<PAGE>

such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Payment
Agent, the Administrative Agents and each Lender and their respective Affiliates
under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including,
without limitation, other rights of setoff) that the Payment Agent, the
Administrative Agents, such Lender and their respective Affiliates may have.

          11.10. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If any Agent or any
Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the
excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds
such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the
interest contracted for, charged, or received by an Agent or a Lender exceeds
the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
(a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or
premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects
thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal
parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.

          11.11. Counterparts. This Agreement and each other Loan Document may
be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery by telecopier of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement and each other Loan Document shall be effective as
delivery of an original executed counterpart of this Agreement and such other
Loan Document. The Agents may also require that any such documents and
signatures delivered by telecopier be confirmed by a manually-signed original
thereof; provided that the failure to request or deliver the same shall not
limit the effectiveness of any document or signature delivered by telecopier.

          11.12. Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan
Documents, comprises the complete and integrated agreement of the parties on the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements, written
or oral, on such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control; provided that the inclusion of
supplemental rights or remedies in favor of the Agents or the Lenders in any
other Loan Document shall not be deemed a conflict with this Agreement. Each
Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties
thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but
rather in accordance with the fair meaning thereof.

          11.13. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations
and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by each Agent
and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by any Agent or any Lender
or on their behalf and notwithstanding that any Agent or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and
shall continue in full force

                                       156

<PAGE>

and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain
unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

          11.14. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

          11.15. Tax Forms.

          (a)    (i) Each Lender that is not a "United States person" within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Foreign Lender") shall deliver to
the Payment Agent, prior to receipt of any payment subject to withholding under
the Code (or upon accepting an assignment of an interest herein), two duly
signed completed copies of either IRS Form W-8BEN or any successor thereto
(relating to such Foreign Lender and entitling it to an exemption from, or
reduction of, withholding tax on all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender
by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or IRS Form W-8ECI or any successor
thereto (relating to all payments to be made to such Foreign Lender by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement) or such other evidence satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Payment Agent that such Foreign Lender is entitled to an
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding tax, including any exemption
pursuant to Section 881(c) of the Code, and in the case of a Foreign Lender
claiming such an exemption under Section 881(c) of the Code, a certificate that
establishes in writing to the Administrative Agent that such Foreign Lender is
not (i) a "bank" as defined in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (ii) a
10-percent shareholder within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code,
and (iii) a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower within the
meaning of Section 864(d) of the Code. Thereafter and from time to time, each
such Foreign Lender shall (A) promptly submit to the Payment Agent such
additional duly completed and signed copies of one of such forms (or such
successor forms as shall be adopted from time to time by the relevant United
States taxing authorities) as may then be available under then current United
States laws and regulations to avoid, or such evidence as is satisfactory to the
Borrower and the Payment Agent of any available exemption from or reduction of,
United States withholding taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such
Foreign Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, (B) promptly notify
the Payment Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render
invalid any claimed exemption or reduction, and (C) take such steps as shall not
be materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender,
and as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending
Office) to avoid any requirement of applicable Laws that the Borrower make any
deduction or withholding for taxes from amounts payable to such Foreign Lender.

          (ii)   Each Foreign Lender, to the extent it does not act or ceases to
act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable
to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a
typical participation by such Lender), shall deliver to the Payment Agent on the
date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own

                                       157

<PAGE>

account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid or payable, and at
such other times as may be necessary in the determination of the Payment Agent
(in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), (A) two duly signed completed
copies of the forms or statements required to be provided by such Lender as set
forth above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with
respect to which such Lender acts for its own account that is not subject to
U.S. withholding tax, and (B) two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form
W-8IMY (or any successor thereto), together with any information such Lender
chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of
exemption required under the Code, to establish that such Lender is not acting
for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such
Lender.

          (iii)  The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amount
to any Foreign Lender under Section 3.01 (A) with respect to any Taxes required
to be deducted or withheld on the basis of the information, certificates or
statements of exemption such Lender transmits with an IRS Form W-8IMY pursuant
to this Section 11.15(a) or (B) if such Lender shall have failed to satisfy the
foregoing provisions of this Section 11.15(a); provided that if such Lender
shall have satisfied the requirement of this Section 11.15(a) on the date such
Lender became a Lender or ceased to act for its own account with respect to any
payment under any of the Loan Documents, nothing in this Section 11.15(a) shall
relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay any amounts pursuant to Section
3.01 in the event that, as a result of any change in any applicable Law, treaty
or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any change in the interpretation,
administration or application thereof, such Lender is no longer properly
entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent date
establishing the fact that such Lender or other Person for the account of which
such Lender receives any sums payable under any of the Loan Documents is not
subject to withholding or is subject to withholding at a reduced rate.

          (iv)   The Payment Agent may, without reduction, withhold any Taxes
required to be deducted and withheld from any payment under any of the Loan
Documents with respect to which the Borrower is not required to pay additional
amounts under this Section 11.15(a).

          (b)    Upon the request of the Payment Agent, each Lender that is a
"United States person" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code
shall deliver to the Payment Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form
W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Payment Agent may
withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to the
applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.

          (c)    If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Payment Agent
did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or
other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender
shall indemnify the Payment Agent therefor, including all penalties and
interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the
Payment Agent under this Section 11.15, and costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs) of the Payment Agent. The obligation of the Lenders under this
Section 11.15 shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments,
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder and the resignation of the Payment
Agent.

          11.17. Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO

assigns, except that the Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights
hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the
Lenders. Each Lender who is also a "lender" or similar party of interest under
