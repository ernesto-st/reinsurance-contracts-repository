8.5.4    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PER PREGNANCY OUTCOME

         Because costs for pregnancy outcomes were not included in the
         capitation rates, the contractor shall be paid supplemental payments
         for pregnancy outcomes for all eligibility categories.

         Payment for pregnancy outcome shall be a single, predetermined lump sum
         payment. This amount shall supplement the existing capitation rate
         paid. The Department will make a supplemental payment to contractors
         following pregnancy outcome. For purposes of this Article, pregnancy
         outcome shall mean each live birth, still birth or miscarriage
         occurring at the thirteenth (13th) or greater week of gestation. This
         supplemental payment shall reimburse the contractor for its inpatient
         hospital, antepartum, and postpartum costs incurred in connection with
         delivery. Costs for care of the baby for the first 60 days after the
         birth plus through the end of the month in which the 60th day falls are
         included (See Section 8.5.3). Regional payment shall be made by the
         State to the contractor based on submission of appropriate encounter
         data as specified by DMAHS.

         The contractor shall be paid separately for factor VIII and IX blood
         clotting factors. Payment will be made by DMAHS to the contractor based

         from the contractor to DMAHS within 12 months of the date of service of
         identification of individuals with factor VIII or IX hemophilia.
         Payment for these products will be the lesser of: 1) Average Wholesale
         Price (AWP) minus 12.5% and 2) rates paid by the contractor.

8.5.6    PAYMENT FOR HIV/AIDS DRUGS

         The contractor shall be paid separately for protease inhibitors and
         other anti-retroviral agents (First Data Bank Specific Therapeutic
         Class Codes W5C, W5B, W5I, WSJ, W5K, W5L, W5M, W5N). Payment for
         protease inhibitors shall be made by DMAHS to the contractor based on:
         1) submission of appropriate encounter data; and 2) notification from
         the contractor to DMAHS within 12 months of the date of service of

         2) rates paid by the contractor.

         Individuals eligible through NJ FamilyCare with a program status code
         of 380 and all children groups shall receive protease inhibitors and
         other anti-retroviral agents under the contractor's plan. All other

                           b.       The claim is for prenatal care for a
                                    pregnant woman or for preventive pediatric
                                    services (including EPSDT services) that are
                                    covered by the Medicaid program.

                           c.       The claim is for labor, delivery, and
                                    post-partum care and does not involve
                                    hospital costs associated with the inpatient
                                    hospital stay.

                           d.       The claim is for a child who is in a DYFS
                                    supported out of home placement.

                           e.       The claim involves coverage or services
                                    mentioned in 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, or 1.d, above
                                    in combination with another service.

                  2.       If the contractor knows that the third party will
                           neither pay for nor provide the covered service, and
                           the service is medically necessary, the contractor
                           shall neither deny payment for the service nor
                           require a written denial from the third party.

                  3.       If the contractor does not know whether a particular
                           service is covered by the third party, and the
                           service is medically necessary, the contractor shall
                           contact the third party and determine whether or not
                           such service is covered rather than requiring the
                           enrollee to do so. Further, the contractor shall
                           require the provider or subcontractor to bill the
                           third party if coverage is available.

                  4.       IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WITH THE PRIOR APPROVAL
                           OF THE DMAHS, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL RETAIN THE ABILITY
                           TO INITIATE TPL RECOVERY ACTIONS AGAINST HEALTH

                           APPEAL RESOLUTIONS. IN THESE CASES, ALL RECOVERED
                           FUNDS SHALL BE RETAINED BY THE CONTRACTOR; A SUMMARY
                           LEVEL OF THE RECOVERY EXPERIENCE, NET OF ANY VENDOR

                           IN CLAIMS ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE
                           WITH THE MONTHLY CLAIMS FILES, REFERENCED IN SECTION
                           8.7.D.1.A. THE STATE WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THESE NET

                           information, the State may provide the contractor
                           with a list of all known health insurance coverage
                           information for the purpose of updating the
                           contractor's files. This information will be in the

                  calculated and made to the last day of a calendar month except
                  as noted in this Article.

         J.       Risk Assumption. The capitation rates shall not include any
                  amount for recoupment of any losses suffered by the contractor
                  for risks assumed under this contract or any prior contract
                  with the Department.

         K.       Hospitalizations. For any eligible person who applies for
                  participation in the contractor's plan, but who is

                  effective, such coverage shall not commence until the date
                  after such person is discharged from the hospital and DMAHS
                  shall be liable for payment for the hospitalization, including
                  any charges for readmission within forty-eight (48) hours of

                  disenrollment or termination becomes effective during a
                  hospitalization, the contractor shall be liable for
                  hospitalization until the date such person is discharged from
                  the hospital, including any charges for readmission within

                  The contractor must notify DMAHS of these occurrences to
                  facilitate payment to appropriate providers.

         L.       Continuation of Benefits. The contractor shall continue
                  benefits for all enrollees for the duration of the contract
                  period for which capitation payments have been made, including
                  enrollees in an inpatient facility until discharge. The
                  contractor shall notify DMAHS of these occurrences.

         M.       Drug Carve-Out Report. The DMAHS will provide the contractor
                  with a monthly electronic file of paid drug claims data for
                  non-dually eligible, ABD enrollees.

         N.       MCSA Administrative Fee. The Contractor shall receive a
                  monthly administrative fee, PMPM, for its MCSA enrollees, by
                  the fifteenth (15th) day of any month during which health care
                  services will be available to an enrollee.

         O.       Reimbursement for MCSA Enrollee Paid Claims. The contractor
                  shall submit to DMAHS a financial summary report of claims
                  paid on behalf of MCSA enrollees on a weekly basis. The report
                  shall be summarized by category of service corresponding to
                  the MCSA benefits and payment dates, accompanied by an
                  electronic file of all individual claim numbers for which the
                  State is being billed.

         P.       MCSA Claims Payment Audits. The contractor shall monitor and
                  audit claims payments to providers to identify payment errors,
                  including duplicate payments, overpayments, underpayments, and
                  excessive payments. For such payment errors (excluding
                  underpayments), the contractor shall refund DMAHS the overpaid
                  amounts. The contractor shall report the dollar amount of
                  claims with payment errors on a monthly basis, which is
                  subject to verification by the State. The contractor is
                  responsible for collecting funds due to the State from
                  providers, either through cash payments or through offsets to
                  payments due the providers.

                           may initiate disenrollment or transfer for any reason

                           and at least every twelve (12) months thereafter

                                    the right to disenroll from the contractor's
                                    plan without cause applies to an
                                    individual's initial period of enrollment
                                    with the contractor. If that individual

                                    loss of Medicaid eligibility has caused the
                                    individual to miss the annual disenrollment
                                    opportunity.

         -        Development of base rates for the risk adjusted populations.

         -        Development of algebraic expressions that relate demographic
                  and clinical characteristics of beneficiaries to their
                  expected, prospective covered health care

                  CONTRACTOR'S PLAN-all services and responsibilities undertaken
                  by the contractor pursuant to this contract.

                  CONTRACTOR'S REPRESENTATIVE -- the individual legally
                  empowered to bind the contractor, using his/her signature
                  block, including his/her title. This individual will be
                  considered the Contractor's Representative during the life of
                  any contract entered into with the State unless amended in
                  writing pursuant to Article 7.

                  COPAYMENT-- the part of the cost-sharing requirement for NJ
                  FamilyCare Plan D AND H enrollees in which a fixed monetary
                  amount is paid for certain services/items received from the
                  contractor's providers.

                  COST AVOIDANCE--a method of paying claims in which the
                  provider is not reimbursed until the provider has demonstrated
                  that all available health insurance has been exhausted.

                  COST NEUTRAL--the mechanism used to smooth data, share risk,
                  or adjust for risk that will recognize both higher and lower
                  expected costs and is not intended to create a net aggregate
                  gain or loss across all payments.

                  COVERED SERVICES--see "BENEFITS PACKAGE"

                  CREDENTIALING--the contractor's determination as to the
                  qualifications and ascribed privileges of a specific provider
                  to render specific health care services.

                  CULTURAL COMPETENCY--a set of interpersonal skills that allow
                  individuals to increase their understanding, appreciation,
                  acceptance of and respect for cultural differences and
                  similarities within, among and between groups and the
                  sensitivity to how these differences influence relationships
                  with enrollees. This requires a willingness and ability to
                  draw on community-based values, traditions and customs, to
                  devise strategies to better meet culturally diverse enrollee
                  needs, and to work with knowledgeable persons of and from the
                  community in developing focused interactions, communications,
                  and other supports.

                  CWA OR COUNTY WELFARE AGENCY ALSO KNOWN AS COUNTY BOARD OF
                  SOCIAL SERVICES--the agency within the county government that
                  makes determination of eligibility for Medicaid and financial

                  either the enrollee or provider of care, and may be measured

                  number of calls per hundred that are or can be blocked from
                  the system. In this sample, P7 means seven (7) calls in a
                  hundred may be blocked, so the system is designed to meet this
                  criterion. Typically, the grade of service is designed to meet
                  the peak busy hour, the busiest hour of the busiest day of the

                  to the contractor to resolve discrepancies that may arise
                  between the roster and contractor enrollment files. If DMAHS
                  notifies the contractor in writing of changes in the roster,
                  the contractor shall rely upon that written notification in
                  the same manner as the roster. Corrective action shall be
                  limited to one (1) year from the date that the change was
                  effective.

                  1.       An enrollee subject to the enrollment Lock-In period
                           may initiate disenrollment or transfer for any reason
                           during the first ninety (90) days after the latter of

                                    plan without cause applies to an
                                    individual's initial period of enrollment
                                    with the contractor. If that individual
                                    chooses to re-enroll with the contractor,

                                    period of 2 months or less, if the temporary
                                    loss of Medicaid eligibility has caused the
                                    individual to miss the annual disenrollment
                                    opportunity.

                           liable third party, unless prior approval to take
                           other action is obtained from the State,

                           a.       The coverage is derived from a parent whose
                                    obligation to pay support is being enforced

                                    pregnant woman or for preventive pediatric
                                    services (including EPSDT services) that are
                                    covered by the Medicaid program.

                           c.       The claim is for labor, delivery, and
                                    post-partum care and does not involve
                                    hospital costs associated with the inpatient
                                    hospital stay.

                           d.       The claim is for a child who is in a DYFS
                                    supported out of home placement.

                           e.       The claim involves coverage or services

                  2.       If the contractor knows that the third party will
                           neither pay for nor provide the covered service, and
                           the service is medically necessary, the contractor
                           shall neither deny payment for the service nor
                           require a written denial from the third party.

                  3.       If the contractor does not know whether a particular
                           service is covered by the third party, and the
                           service is medically necessary, the contractor shall
                           contact the third party and determine whether or not
                           such service is covered rather than requiring the
                           enrollee to do so. Further, the contractor shall
                           require the provider or subcontractor to bill the
                           third party if coverage is available.

                  an enrollee to providers of health care services other than
                  the contractor for the benefits covered in Article Four and
                  rendered during the term of this contract.

                  capitation payment per enrollee. is due to the contractor from

                  this contract, whichever occurs first.

                  DMAHS' capitation payment obligation is computed, if an
                  enrollee's coverage begins after the first day of a month,
                  DMAHS will pay the contractor a fractional capitation payment
                  that is proportionate to the part of the month during which
                  the contractor provides coverage. Payments are calculated and
                  made to the last day of a - calendar month except as noted in

         J.       Risk Assumption. The capitation rates shall not include any
                  amount for recoupment of any losses suffered by the contractor

                  participation in the contractor's plan, but who is
                  hospitalized prior to the time coverage under the plan becomes
                  effective, such coverage shall not commence until the date
                  after such person is discharged from the hospital and DMAHS
                  shall be liable for payment for the hospitalization, including
                  any charges for readmission within forty-eight (48) hours of
                  discharge for the same diagnosis. If an enrollee's
                  disenrollment or termination becomes effective during a
                  hospitalization, the contractor shall be liable for
                  hospitalization until the date such person is discharged from
                  the hospital, including any charges for readmission within
                  forty-eight (48) hours of discharge for the same diagnosis,
                  The contractor must notify DMAHS of these occurrences to
                  facilitate payment to appropriate providers.

         L.       Continuation of Benefits. The contractor shall continue
                  benefits for all enrollees for the duration of the contract
                  period for which capitation payments have been made, including
                  enrollees in an inpatient facility until discharge, The
                  contractor shall notify DMAHS of these occurrences.

8.6      HEALTH BASED PAYMENT SYSTEM (HBPS) FOR THE ABD POPULATION WITHOUT
         MEDICARE

         The DMAHS shall utilize a Health-Based Payment System (HBPS) for
         reimbursements for the ABD population without Medicare to recognize
         larger average health care costs and greater dispersion around the
         average than other DMAHS populations. The contractor shall be
         reimbursed not only on the basis of the demographic cells into which
         individuals fall, but also on the basis of individual health status.

         The Chronic Disability Payment System (CDPS) (University of California,
         San Diego) is the HBPS or the system of Risk Adjustment that shall be
         used in this contract. The methodology for CDPS specific to New Jersey
         is provided in the Actuarial Certification Letter for Risk Adjustment
         issued separately to the contractor. Two base capitation rates and a
         DDD mental health/substance abuse add-on are developed for this
         population. These are:

         -        ABD without Medicare, non-DDD

         -        ABD DDD without Medicare, physical health component

         -        ABD - DDD without Medicare, Mental Health/Substance Abuse
                  add-on-component

         The Risk adjustment process has four major components.

         -        Development of base rates for the risk adjusted populations.

         -        Development of algebraic expressions that relate demographic
                  and clinical characteristics of beneficiaries to their
                  expected, prospective covered health care

         CONTRACTOR--the Health Maintenance Organization with a valid
         Certificate of Authority in New Jersey that contracts hereunder with

         contractor pursuant to this contract.

         CONTRACTOR'S REPRESENTATIVE--the individual legally empowered to bind
         the contractor, using his/her signature block, including his/her title.
         This individual will be considered the Contractor's Representative

         amended in writing pursuant to Article 7.

         COPAYMENT--the part of the cost-sharing requirement for NJ FamilyCare
         Plan D enrollees in which a fixed monetary amount is paid for certain
         services/items received from the contractor's providers.

         COST AVOIDANCE--a method of paying claims in which the provider is not
         reimbursed until the provider has demonstrated that all available
         health insurance has been exhausted.

         for risk that will recognize both higher and lower expected costs and

         influence relationships with enrollees. This requires a willingness and
         ability to draw on community-based values, traditions and customs, to
         devise strategies to better meet culturally diverse enrollee needs, and
         to work with knowledgeable persons of and from the community in

                  law, health care services cannot be denied to a Medicaid
                  enrollee because of a third party's, potential liability to
                  pay for the services, and the contractor shall ensure that its
                  cost avoidance efforts do not prevent an enrollee from
                  receiving medically necessary services.

         A.       For purposes of this contract, "emergency" means an onset of a
                  medical or behavioral condition, the onset of which is
                  sudden, that manifests itself by symptoms of sufficient
                  severity, including severe pain,-that a prudent layperson, who
                  possesses an average knowledge of medicine and health, could
                  reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention
                  to result in:

                  1.       Placing the health of the person or others in serious
                           jeopardy;

                           such person; or

                  4.       Serious disfigurement of such person.

                  With respect to a pregnant woman who is having contractions,
                  an emergency exists where there is inadequate time to effect a
                  safe transfer to another hospital before delivery or the
                  transfer may pose a threat to the health or safety of the
                  woman or the unborn child.
