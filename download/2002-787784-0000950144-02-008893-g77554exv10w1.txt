to or greater than the Debt Service Coverage immediately before the Partial
Release and equal to or greater than 1.75:1, and (3) the Loan to Value Ratio
will be not more than 80%;

                (d) All accrued but unpaid interest on the outstanding principal
balance of the Loan shall be paid at the time the Partial Release is made; and

                (e) Borrower shall pay all costs and expenses of Lender arising
in connection with the Partial Release, including but not limited to, legal fees
of Lender's counsel, all title insurance premiums arising as a result of
endorsements required by Lender in connection with the Partial Release and all
other costs arising in connection with the execution and delivery of the Partial
Release.

         Section 2.6 EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE. Provided no Event of Default or
Potential Default exists, Lender shall on request of Borrower not more than
ninety (90) days before and not fewer than sixty (60) days before the Maturity

additional one-year periods upon the following conditions:

                (a) receipt and approval by Lender of a satisfactory current

Ratio of not more than 80%;

                (c) receipt by Lender of an extension fee in the amount of
one-half percent (0.5%) of the principal balance of the Loan;

<PAGE>

                (d) Borrower's purchase of a further Interest Rate Protection

                (e) receipt by Lender of an estoppel certificate executed by
Operating Lessee and confirming that the Operating Lease is in full force and

matters as Lender reasonably shall request.

                (f) execution by Borrower of an agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to Lender, renewing and extending the Maturity Date of the Loan and

                                   ARTICLE 3
                      INSURANCE, CONDEMNATION, AND IMPOUNDS

         Section 3.1 INSURANCE. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall maintain
insurance as follows:

                (a) CASUALTY; BUSINESS INTERRUPTION. Borrower and Operating
Lessee shall keep the Projects insured against damage by fire and the other
hazards covered by a standard extended coverage and all-risk insurance policy
for the full insurable value thereof (without reduction for depreciation or
co-insurance), and shall maintain such other casualty insurance as reasonably
required by Lender. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall keep any Project that is
located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as an
area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made
available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (and any successor act
thereto) insured against loss by flood in an amount at least equal to the lesser
of (1) the maximum amount of the Loan or (2) the maximum limit of coverage
available under said act. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall maintain use and
occupancy insurance covering, as applicable, rental income or business
interruption, with coverage in an amount not less than twelve (12)-months
anticipated gross rental income or gross business earnings, as applicable in
each case, attributable to the Projects. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee
shall maintain any separate or additional insurance which is contributing in the
event of loss unless it is properly endorsed and otherwise satisfactory to
Lender in all respects. The proceeds of insurance paid on account of any damage
or destruction to a Project shall be paid to Lender to be applied as provided in
Section 3.2.

                (b) LIABILITY. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall maintain (1)
commercial general liability insurance with respect to each Project providing
for limits of liability of not less than $11,000,000 for both injury to or death
of a person and for property damage per occurrence, and (2) other liability
insurance as reasonably required by Lender.

                (c) FORM AND QUALITY. All insurance policies shall be endorsed
in form and substance acceptable to Lender to name Lender as an additional
insured, loss payee or mortgagee




                                       13
<PAGE>

thereunder, as its interest may appear, with loss payable to Lender, without
contribution, under a standard New York (or local equivalent) mortgagee clause.
All such insurance policies and endorsements shall be fully paid for and contain
such provisions and expiration dates and be in such form and issued by such
insurance companies licensed to do business in the State, with a rating of "A-X"
or better as established by Best's Rating Guide (or an equivalent rating
approved in writing by Lender). Each policy shall provide that such policy may
not be canceled or materially changed except upon thirty (30) days' prior
written notice of intention of non-renewal, cancellation or material change to
Lender and that no act or thing done by Borrower shall invalidate any policy as
against Lender. At Lender's request from time to time, Borrower shall furnish to
Lender true and correct copies of all policies of insurance required hereunder.
If Borrower or Operating Lessee fails to maintain insurance in compliance with
this Section 3.1, Lender may obtain such insurance and pay the premium therefor
and Borrower and Operating Lessee shall, on demand, reimburse Lender for all
expenses incurred in connection therewith. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
assign the policies or proofs of insurance to Lender, in such manner and form
that Lender and its successors and assigns shall at all times have and hold the
same as security for the payment of the Loan. Borrower and Operating Lessee
shall deliver copies of all original policies certified to Lender by the
insurance company or authorized agent as being true copies, together with the
endorsements required hereunder. The proceeds of insurance policies coming into
the possession of Lender shall not be deemed trust funds, and Lender shall be
entitled to apply such proceeds as herein provided.

                (d) ADJUSTMENTS. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall give
immediate written notice of any loss to the insurance carrier and to Lender.
Borrower and Operating Lessee hereby irrevocably authorize and empower Lender,
as attorney-in-fact for Borrower and Operating Lessee coupled with an interest,
to make proof of loss, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such
insurance policies, to collect and receive insurance proceeds, and to deduct
therefrom Lender's expenses incurred in the collection of such proceeds, and if
an Event of Default or Potential Default exists, to adjust and compromise any
claim under insurance policies. Nothing contained in this Section 3.1(d),
however, shall require Lender to incur any expense or take any action hereunder.

         Section 3.2 USE AND APPLICATION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS. Lender shall
apply insurance proceeds (other than proceeds of rental income or business
interruption insurance which shall constitute Operating Revenues) to costs of
restoring a damaged Project or the Loan as follows:

                (a) if the loss is less than or equal to $300,000, Lender shall
apply the insurance proceeds to restoration provided (1) no Event of Default or
Potential Default exists, and (2) Borrower promptly commences and is diligently
pursuing restoration of the Project;

                (b) if the loss exceeds $300,000 but is not more than 10% of the
replacement value of the improvements (for projects containing multiple phases
or stand alone structures, such calculation to be based on the damaged phase or
structure, not the project as a whole), Lender shall apply the insurance
proceeds to restoration provided that at all times during such restoration (1)
no Event of Default or Potential Default exists; (2) Lender determines that
there are sufficient funds available to restore and repair the Project to a
condition approved by Lender; (3) Lender determines that the Net Operating
Income of the Projects during restoration will be




                                       14
<PAGE>

sufficient to pay Debt Service; (4) Lender determines that after restoration the
Debt Service Coverage will be at least 1.48:1, the Cash on Cash Return will be
at least 12.70% and the Loan to Value Ratio will not exceed 80%; (5) Lender
determines that restoration and repair of the Project to a condition approved by
Lender will be completed within six months after the date of loss or casualty
and in any event ninety (90) days prior to the Maturity Date; and (6) Borrower
or Operating Lessee promptly commences and is diligently pursuing restoration of
the Project;

                (c) if the conditions set forth above are not satisfied or the
loss exceeds the maximum amount specified in Section 3.2(b) above, in Lender's
sole discretion, Lender may apply any insurance proceeds it may receive to the
payment of the Loan or allow all or a portion of such proceeds to be used for
the restoration of the Project; and

                (d) insurance proceeds applied to restoration will be disbursed
on receipt of satisfactory plans and specifications, contracts and subcontracts,
schedules, budgets, lien waivers and architects' certificates, and otherwise in
accordance with prudent commercial construction lending practices for
construction loan advances, including, as applicable, the advance conditions
under Schedule 2.1.

         Section 3.3 CONDEMNATION AWARDS. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
immediately notify Lender of the institution of any proceeding for the
condemnation or other taking of a Project or any portion thereof. Lender may
participate in any such proceeding and Borrower and Operating Lessee will
deliver to Lender all instruments necessary or required by Lender to permit such
participation. Without Lender's prior consent, Borrower and Operating Lessee,
individually or together, (a) shall not agree to any compensation or award, and
(b) shall not take any action or fail to take any action which would cause the
compensation to be determined. All awards and compensation for the taking or
purchase in lieu of condemnation of a Project or any part thereof are hereby
assigned to and shall be paid to Lender. Borrower and Operating Lessee authorize
Lender to collect and receive such awards and compensation, to give proper
receipts and acquittances therefor, and in Lender's sole discretion to apply the
same toward the payment of the Loan, notwithstanding that the Loan may not then
be due and payable, or to the restoration of the Project; however, if the award
is less than or equal to $300,000 and Borrower and Operating Lessee request that
such proceeds be used for non-structural site improvements (such as landscape,
driveway, walkway and parking area repairs) required to be made as a result of
such condemnation, Lender will apply the award to such restoration in accordance
with disbursement procedures applicable to insurance proceeds provided there
exists no Potential Default or Event of Default. Borrower and Operating Lessee,
upon request by Lender, shall execute all instruments requested to confirm the
assignment of the awards and compensation to Lender, free and clear of all
liens, charges or encumbrances.

         Section 3.4 IMPOUNDS. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall deposit with
Lender, monthly, one-twelfth (1/12th) of the annual charges for real estate
taxes, assessments and similar charges relating to the Projects. At or before
the initial advance of the Loan, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall deposit
with Lender a sum of money which together with the monthly installments will be
sufficient to make each of such payments thirty (30) days prior to the date any
delinquency or penalty becomes due with respect to such payments. Deposits shall
be made on the basis of Lender's estimate from time to time of the charges for
the current year (after giving effect to any reassessment or, at Lender's
election, on the basis of the charges for the prior




                                       15
<PAGE>

year, with adjustments when the charges are fixed for the then current year).
All funds so deposited shall be held by Lender in an interest-bearing account
controlled by Lender and may be commingled with Lender's general funds. Borrower
and Operating Lessee hereby grant to Lender a security interest in all funds so
deposited with Lender for the purpose of securing the Loan. While an Event of
Default exists, the funds deposited may be applied in payment of the charges for
which such funds have been deposited, or to the payment of the Loan or any other
charges affecting the security of Lender, as Lender may elect, but no such
application shall be deemed to have been made by operation of law or otherwise
until actually made by Lender. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall furnish
Lender with bills for the charges for which such deposits are required at least
thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the charges first become payable. If
at any time the amount on deposit with Lender, together with amounts to be
deposited by Borrower or Operating Lessee before such charges are payable, is
insufficient to pay such charges, Borrower or Operating Lessee shall deposit any
deficiency with Lender immediately upon demand. Lender shall pay such charges
when the amount on deposit with Lender is sufficient to pay such charges and
Lender has received a bill for such charges. Pursuant to Section 8.2, Borrower
and Operating Lessee unconditionally and irrevocably covenant and agree to pay
all real estate taxes, assessments, and similar charges on the Projects, prior
to the delinquency thereof.

                                   ARTICLE 4
                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

         Section 4.1 CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. As used herein, the following terms
have the meanings indicated:

                (a) "ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS" means any federal, state or local law
(whether imposed by statute, or administrative or judicial order, or common
law), now or hereafter enacted, governing health, safety, industrial hygiene,

by-product thereof, (2) asbestos or asbestos-containing materials, (3)
polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs), (4) radon gas, (5) underground storage tanks,
(6) any explosive or radioactive substances, (7) lead or lead-based paint, or
(8) any other substance, material, waste or mixture which is or shall be listed,

         Section 4.2 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. To
the knowledge of Borrower and Operating Lessee, except as set forth in the Site
Assessment, (a) no Hazardous Material is now or was formerly used, stored,
generated, manufactured, installed, disposed of or otherwise present at or about
any Project or any property adjacent to a Project (except for cleaning and other
products currently used in connection with the routine maintenance or repair of
the Project in full compliance with Environmental Laws), (b) all permits,
licenses, approvals and filings required by Environmental Laws have been
obtained, and





                                       16
<PAGE>

the use, operation and condition of the Projects do not, and did not previously,
violate any Environmental Laws, and (c) no civil, criminal or administrative
action, suit, claim, hearing, investigation or proceeding has been brought or
been threatened, nor have any settlements been reached by or with any parties or
any liens imposed in connection with any Project concerning Hazardous Materials
or Environmental Laws.

         Section 4.3 COVENANTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                (a) Borrower and Operating Lessee shall (1) comply strictly and
in all respects with applicable Environmental Laws; (2) notify Lender
immediately upon discovery of any spill, discharge, release or presence of any
Hazardous Material at, upon, under, within, contiguous to or otherwise affecting
a Project by Borrower or Operating Lessee; (3) promptly remove such Hazardous
Materials and remediate a Project in full compliance with Environmental Laws and
in accordance with the recommendations and specifications of an independent
environmental consultant approved by Lender; and (4) promptly forward to Lender
copies of all orders, notices, permits, applications or other communications and
reports in connection with any spill, discharge, release or the presence of any
Hazardous Material or any other matters relating to the Environmental Laws or
any similar laws or regulations, as they may affect a Project, Borrower or
Operating Lessee.

                (b) Borrower and Operating Lessee shall not cause, shall
prohibit any other Person within the Control of Borrower or Operating Lessee
from causing, and shall use prudent, commercially reasonable efforts to prohibit
other Persons (including tenants) from (1) causing any spill, discharge or
release, or the use, storage, generation, manufacture, installation, or
disposal, of any Hazardous Materials at, upon, under, within or about a Project
or the transportation of any Hazardous Materials to or from a Project (except
for cleaning and other products used in connection with routine maintenance or
repair of the Project in full compliance with Environmental Laws), (2)
installing any underground storage tanks at a Project, or (3) conducting any
activity that requires a permit or other authorization under Environmental Laws.

                (c) Borrower and Operating Lessee shall provide to Lender, at
Borrower's and Operating Lessee's expense promptly upon the written request of
Lender from time to time, a Site Assessment or, if required by Lender, an update
to any existing Site Assessment, to assess the presence or absence of any
Hazardous Materials and the potential costs in connection with abatement,
cleanup or removal of any Hazardous Materials found on, under, at or within a
Project. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall pay the cost of no more than one
such Site Assessment or update in any twelve (12)-month period, unless Lender's
request for a Site Assessment is based on information provided under Section
4.3(a), a reasonable suspicion of Hazardous Materials at or near a Project
(exclusive of the matters established in the Site Assessment), a breach of
representations under Section 4.2, or an Event of Default, in which case any
such Site Assessment or update shall be at Borrower's expense.

         Section 4.4 ALLOCATION OF RISKS AND INDEMNITY. As between Borrower and
Lender and as between Operating Lessee and Lender, all risk of loss associated
with non-compliance with Environmental Laws, or with the presence of any
Hazardous Material at, upon, within, contiguous to or otherwise affecting a
Project, shall lie solely with Borrower and Operating Lessee. Accordingly,
Borrower and Operating Lessee shall bear all risks and costs associated





                                       17
<PAGE>

with any loss (including any loss in value attributable to Hazardous Materials),
damage or liability therefrom, including all costs of removal of Hazardous
Materials or other remediation required by Lender or by law. Borrower and
Operating Lessee shall indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and
against all loss, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses (including
reasonable costs of defense) arising out of or associated, in any way, with the
non-compliance with Environmental Laws, or the existence of Hazardous Materials
in, on, or about a Project, or a breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Article 4, whether based in contract, tort, implied
or express warranty, strict liability, criminal or civil statute or common law,
including those arising from the joint, concurrent, or comparative negligence of
Lender; however, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall not be liable under such
indemnification to the extent such loss, liability, damage, claim, cost or
expense results solely from Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct
occurring after foreclosure. Borrower's and Operating Lessee's obligations under
this Section 4.4 shall arise upon the discovery of the presence of any Hazardous
Material, whether or not any governmental authority has taken or threatened any
action in connection with the presence of any Hazardous Material, and whether or
not the existence of any such Hazardous Material or potential liability on
account thereof is disclosed in the Site Assessment and shall continue
notwithstanding the repayment of the Loan or any transfer or sale of any right,
title and interest in a Project (by foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise).

         Section 4.5 COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT OF INDEMNITIES. Borrower and
Operating Lessee hereby collaterally assign all of the rights and benefits (but
none of the obligations or liabilities) under any indemnity agreement or
provision with respect to one or more of the Projects, including any
indemnification agreement for the benefit of Borrower or Operating Lessee
executed by any previous owner of any of the Projects.

         Section 4.6 NO WAIVER. Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 4
or elsewhere in the Loan Documents, or any rights or remedies granted by the
Loan Documents, Lender does not waive and expressly reserves all rights and
benefits now or hereafter accruing to Lender under the "security interest" or
"secured creditor" exception under applicable Environmental Laws, as the same
may be amended. No action taken by Lender pursuant to the Loan Documents shall
be deemed or construed to be a waiver or relinquishment of any such rights or
benefits under the "security interest exception."

                                   ARTICLE 5
                                 LEASING MATTERS

material unfavorable modifications (except as approved by Lender). Within ten
(10) days after Lender's request, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall furnish to
Lender a statement of all resident security deposits, and copies of all
Residency Agreements not previously delivered to Lender, certified by Borrower
as being true and correct. Further, except for the Operating Lease, neither
Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall enter into any lease for occupancy of space

                                   ARTICLE 6
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Borrower and Operating Lessee represent and warrant to Lender that:

         Section 6.1 ORGANIZATION AND POWER. Borrower and each Borrower Party is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
state of its formation or existence, and is in compliance with legal
requirements applicable to doing business in the State. Borrower is not a
"foreign person" within the meaning of ss. 1445(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

         Section 6.2 VALIDITY OF LOAN DOCUMENTS. The execution, delivery and
performance by Borrower and each Borrower Party of the Loan Documents: (a) are
duly authorized and do not require the consent or approval of any other party or
governmental authority which has not been obtained; and (b) will not violate any
law or result in the imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon the
assets of any such party, except as contemplated by the Loan Documents. The Loan
Documents constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower and
each Borrower Party, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws generally
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights.

         Section 6.3 LIABILITIES; LITIGATION.

                  (a) The financial statements last delivered by Borrower and
each Borrower Party are true and correct with no significant change since the
date of preparation. Except as disclosed in such financial statements, there are
no liabilities (fixed or contingent) affecting the Projects, Borrower or any
Borrower Party. Except as disclosed in such financial statements, there is no
litigation, administrative proceeding, investigation or other legal action
(including any proceeding under any state or federal bankruptcy or insolvency
law) pending or, to the knowledge of Borrower, threatened, against the Projects,
Borrower or any Borrower Party which if adversely determined could have a
material adverse effect on such party, a Project or the Loan.

                  (b) Neither Borrower nor any Borrower Party is contemplating
either the filing of a petition by it under state or federal bankruptcy or
insolvency laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of its assets or
property, and neither Borrower nor any Borrower Party has knowledge of any
Person contemplating the filing of any such petition against it.

         Section 6.4 TAXES AND ASSESSMENTS. The Projects are comprised of one or
more parcels, each of which constitutes a separate tax lot and none of which
constitutes a portion of any other tax lot. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of Borrower or Operating Lessee, proposed, special or other
assessments for public improvements or otherwise affecting a Project, nor are
there any contemplated improvements to any Project that may result in such
special or other assessments.

         Section 6.5 OTHER AGREEMENTS; DEFAULTS. Neither Borrower, nor Operating
Lessee, nor any Borrower Party is a party to any agreement or instrument or
subject to any court order, injunction, permit, or restriction which might
adversely affect a Project or the business, operations, or condition (financial
or otherwise) of Borrower or any Borrower Party. Neither Borrower, nor Operating
Lessee, nor any Borrower Party is in violation of any agreement which




                                       20
<PAGE>

violation would have an adverse effect on a Project, Borrower, Operating Lessee,
or any Borrower Party or Borrower's or Operating Lessee's or any Borrower
Party's business, properties, or assets, operations or condition, financial or
otherwise.

         Section 6.6 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

                  (a) Operating Lessee holds all licenses, permits, approvals
and provider agreements necessary to own, lease, operate and carry on its
business in the Projects, and such licenses, permits, approvals, and provider
agreements are valid and in full force and effect. Each Project is in compliance
with all applicable legal requirements and, to Borrower's or Operating Lessee's
knowledge, is free of structural defects, and all building systems contained
therein are in good working order, subject to ordinary wear and tear. No Project
constitutes, in whole or in part, a legally non-conforming use under applicable
legal requirements;

                  (b) No condemnation has been commenced or, to Borrower's or
Operating Lessee's knowledge, is contemplated with respect to all or any portion
of a Project or for the relocation of roadways providing access to a Project;
and

                  (c) Each Project has adequate rights of access to public ways
and is served by adequate water, sewer, sanitary sewer and storm drain
facilities. All public utilities necessary or convenient to the full use and
enjoyment of each Project are located in the public right-of-way abutting the
Project, and all such utilities are connected so as to serve the Project without
passing over other property, except to the extent such other property is subject
to a perpetual easement for such utility benefiting the Project. All roads
necessary for the full utilization of each Project for its current purpose have
been completed and dedicated to public use and accepted by all governmental
authorities.

         Section 6.7 LOCATION OF BORROWER. Borrower's and Operating Lessee's
principal place of business and chief executive offices are located at the
address stated in Section 11.1.

         Section 6.8 ERISA. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee has
established any pension plan for employees which would cause Borrower or
Operating Lessee to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended.

         Section 6.9 MARGIN STOCK. No part of proceeds of the Loan will be used
for purchasing or acquiring any "margin stock" within the meaning of Regulations
G, T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

         Section 6.10 TAX FILINGS. Borrower and each Borrower Party have filed
(or have obtained effective extensions for filing) all federal, state and local
tax returns required to be filed and have paid or made adequate provision for
the payment of all federal, state and local taxes, charges and assessments
payable by Borrower and each Borrower Party, respectively.

         Section 6.11 SOLVENCY. Giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable
value of Borrower's assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of
the Loan, exceed Borrower's total liabilities, including, without limitation,
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. The fair
saleable value of Borrower's assets is and will, immediately following the
making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower's probable liabilities, including
the maximum




                                       21
<PAGE>

amount of its contingent liabilities on its Debts as such Debts become absolute
and matured, Borrower's assets do not and, immediately following the making of
the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to carry out its
business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not intend
to, and does not believe that it will, incur Debts and liabilities (including
contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to pay such
Debts as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be
received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of
obligations of Borrower).

         Section 6.12 FULL AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE. No statement of fact made by
or on behalf of Borrower or any Borrower Party in this Agreement or in any of
the other Loan Documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements contained herein
or therein not misleading. There is no fact presently known to Borrower or
Operating Lessee which has not been disclosed to Lender which adversely affects,
nor as far as Borrower or Operating Lessee can foresee, might adversely affect,
the Projects or the business, operations or condition (financial or otherwise)
of Borrower or any Borrower Party.

         Section 6.13 BORROWER SEPARATENESS. Borrower represents, warrants and
covenants as follows:

similar to those that would be available on an arms-length basis with third
parties other than any such party.

                  (d) Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of
Lender, incur any Debt other than the Loan or other than accounts payable
incurred in the ordinary course of business, and no Debt other than the Loan may
be secured (subordinate or pari passu) by the Project.

party.

                  (f) Borrower is and will remain solvent and Borrower will pay

available to pay the debts of the consolidated entity nor constitute obligations
of the consolidated entity and that the consolidated entity is not liable for
any of the liabilities of Borrower and, provided further, that so long as
Borrower's separate tax liability and its income and expenses are readily
determinable based upon a review of Borrower's books and records, it may file
consolidated tax returns.

                  (i) Borrower will be, and at all times will hold itself out to
the public as, a legal entity separate and distinct from any other entity
(including any Affiliate of Borrower, any constituent party of Borrower, any
Joinder Party or any Affiliate of any constituent party or Joinder Party), shall
correct any known misunderstanding regarding its status as a separate entity,
shall conduct business in its own name, shall not identify itself or any of its
Affiliates as a division or part of the other and shall maintain and utilize a
separate telephone number and separate stationery, invoices and checks.

                  (j) Borrower will maintain adequate capital for the normal

                  (k) Neither Borrower nor any constituent party will seek the
dissolution, winding up, liquidation, consolidation or merger in whole or in
part, of the Borrower.

                  (l) Borrower will not commingle the funds and other assets of

any Affiliate of any constituent party or Joinder Party, or any other Person.

Person.

                  (n) Borrower does not and will not hold itself out to be

Borrower or any Borrower Party or any of their respective shareholders,
subsidiaries or Affiliates, (3) a Person controlling or under common Control
with any such shareholder, partner, supplier or customer, or (4) a member of the

units within a Project so long as Borrower and Operating Lessee comply with the
provisions of the Loan Documents relating to such leasing activity.

         Section 8.2 TAXES; CHARGES. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall pay
before any fine, penalty, interest or cost may be added thereto, and shall not
enter into any agreement to defer, any real estate taxes and assessments,
franchise taxes and charges, and other governmental charges that may become a
Lien upon a Project or become payable during the term of the Loan, and will
promptly furnish Lender with evidence of such payment; however, if applicable,
Borrower's and Operating Lessee's compliance with Section 3.4 of this Agreement
relating to impounds for taxes and assessments shall, with respect to payment of
such taxes and assessments, be deemed compliance with this Section 8.2. Borrower
and Operating Lessee shall not suffer or permit the joint assessment of a
Project with any other real property constituting a separate tax lot or with any
other real or personal property. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall pay when
due all claims and demands of mechanics, materialmen, laborers and others which,
if unpaid, might result in a Lien on a Project. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Borrower or Operating Lessee may contest such taxes and charges and such claims
and demands so long as (a) Borrower or Operating Lessee notifies Lender that it
intends to contest such claim or demand, (b) Borrower or Operating Lessee
provides Lender with an indemnity, bond or other security satisfactory to Lender
(including an endorsement to Lender's title insurance policy insuring against
such claim or demand) assuring the discharge of Borrower's obligations for such
claims and demands, including interest and penalties, and (c) Borrower or
Operating Lessee is diligently contesting the same by appropriate legal
proceedings in good faith and at its own expense and concludes such contest
prior to the tenth (10th) day preceding the earlier to occur of the Maturity
Date or the date on which a Project is scheduled to be sold for non-payment.

         Section 8.3 CONTROL; MANAGEMENT. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
remain under the Control of ARCSPE at all times while this Agreement is in
effect. Operating Lessee shall not terminate, replace or appoint any manager or
terminate or amend the management agreement for a Project without Lender's prior
written approval. Operating Lessee shall fully perform all of its covenants,
agreements and obligations under the management agreement. Operating Lessee, or
an Affiliate of Operating Lessee, shall serve as manager of the Projects. If the
manager is an Affiliate of Operating Lessee, such manager shall be entitled to
receive a management fee of up to four percent (4%) of Operating Revenues
pursuant to a management agreement approved by Lender, in Lender's sole and
absolute discretion. No management fee shall be payable if Operating Lessee
manages the Projects. If Operating Lessee seeks to replace the manager, Lender
retains full and absolute approval right over such substitute manager,
management fee and management agreement. Lender shall approve all managers and
management contracts, both presently existing and prior to entering into such
contracts in the future; in addition, all management fees payable under any
management contract shall be subordinate to and be paid following full payment
of all Debt Service payments on the Loan in each fiscal year. Any change in
ownership or Control of the manager shall be cause for Lender to re-approve such
manager and management contract. Operating Lessee shall hold and maintain all
necessary licenses, certifications and permits required by law. Any manager of a
Project, if not an Affiliate of Operating Lessee, shall enter a non-competition
agreement to the effect that such manager will not acquire, construct, operate
or manage any facility similar to the Projects (i.e., an independent living
units facility or an assisted living facility) within a five-mile radius of any
Project at any time while any portion of the Loan is outstanding. Operating
Lessee shall




                                       30
<PAGE>

strictly comply with the Management Standards set forth in Exhibit C attached
hereto, and shall not enter into, modify, amend, or terminate any existing
management agreement, except in accordance with the Management Standards and
this Section 8.3.

         Section 8.4 NON-COMPLIANCE. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
promptly deliver to Lender copies of all reports and other documents with
respect to any inspections, surveys, investigations, or on-site visits of, or
certification actions regarding, the Projects by any federal, state, or local
licensing and regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Projects,
including any inspections by State Agencies. Subject to Section 8.5, Lender may
retain a consultant, at Borrower's and Operating Lessee's expense, to evaluate
and review such reports and documents. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
promptly correct any deficiency and comply with all remedial actions and
recommendations set forth in such reports or specified by the consultant
retained by Lender. Borrower and Operating Lessee will promptly notify Lender of
(a) any non-compliance, or (b) any event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would result in non-compliance, with any statute, law, ordinance, order,
judgment, decree, regulation, direction or requirement concerning Operating
Lessee, its operations, or any of the Projects, or in connection with which
Operating Lessee has received any notice, correspondence other communication to
or from any federal, state or local governmental official, body, board,
department or regulatory authority. If any such notice or communication of a
material nature is received by Borrower or Operating Lessee, Operating Lessee
shall engage an independent consultant as described in Section 8.5 below and
shall provide Lender with a statement setting forth its proposed action or
response to the non-compliance situation. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
promptly notify Lender of any proposed local, state or federal law that, if
enacted, would materially and adversely affect Operating Lessee's current
operation of any of the Projects.

         Section 8.5 CONSULTANT. If (a) Borrower and Operating Lessee fail to
maintain at all times a Debt Service Coverage of at least 1.20:1, or (b) the
occupancy level of the Projects (on a consolidated basis) is less than 87% for
three consecutive months, or (c) Borrower or Operating Lessee receives any
notice, correspondence or other communication of a material nature from any
federal, state or local governmental official, body, board, department or
regulatory authority citing violations of or lack of compliance with any
statute, ordinance and/or regulation concerning Operating Lessee, its
operations, or any of the Projects, then Borrower and Operating Lessee shall, at
their expense, retain an independent consultant selected from a list of
independent consultants designated by Lender from time to time, which
independent consultant is to make recommendations to increase the Debt Service
Coverage to at least 1.30:1, increase the occupancy level to at least 90%, or
make recommendations to address the violation and/or non-compliance situation,
as the case may be. With regard to a notice of violation or non-compliance
received by Borrower or Operating Lessee as described in Section 8.4 above, if
such violation or non-compliance can be cured by Borrower or Operating Lessee
within thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the notice or other
communication relating thereto, then the independent consultant's engagement may
be limited to a review of Borrower's or Operating Lessee's proposed plan to cure
such non-compliance. Such independent consultant will provide a copy of its
report to Borrower and Operating Lessee and to Lender. Borrower and Operating
Lessee further agree that compliance with this covenant and/or the independent
consultant's recommendation will not limit any of Lender's rights and remedies
upon default or excuse Borrower or Operating Lessee from any default whether by
reason of failure to maintain the




                                       31
<PAGE>

above-specified Debt Service Coverage or occupancy level, or the receipt of a
notice of non-compliance or for any other reason.

         Section 8.6 PERMITS AND LICENSES; OPERATION; MAINTENANCE; INSPECTION.
On request of Lender, Operating Lessee shall furnish to Lender true and correct
copies of all currently existing licenses, permits, approvals and agreements
necessary to own, lease, operate and carry on its business in the Projects.
Borrower and Operating Lessee shall observe and comply with all legal
requirements applicable to the ownership, use and operation of the Projects,
including the requirements of State Agencies, and any applicable requirements
under the Medicare (or other reimbursement) program. Borrower and Operating
Lessee shall maintain the Projects in good condition (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and promptly repair any damage or casualty. Borrower and Operating
Lessee shall permit Lender and its agents, representatives and employees, upon
reasonable prior notice to Operating Lessee, to inspect the Projects and conduct
such environmental and engineering studies as Lender may require, provided such
inspections and studies do not materially interfere with the use and operation
of the Projects.

         Section 8.7 TAXES ON SECURITY. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall pay
all taxes, charges, filing, registration and recording fees, excises and levies
payable with respect to the Note or the Liens created or secured by the Loan
Documents, other than income, franchise and doing business taxes imposed on
Lender. If there shall be enacted any law (a) deducting the Loan from the value
of a Project for the purpose of taxation, (b) affecting any Lien on a Project,
or (c) changing existing laws of taxation of mortgages, deeds of trust, security
deeds, or debts secured by real property, or changing the manner of collecting
any such taxes, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall promptly pay to Lender, on
demand, all taxes, costs and charges for which Lender is liable as a result
thereof; however, if such payment would be prohibited by law or would render the
Loan usurious, then instead of collecting such payment, Lender may declare all
amounts owing under the Loan Documents to be immediately due and payable.

         Section 8.8 RESERVES, DEPOSITS, ESCROWS. Borrower and/or Operating
Lessee shall at all times maintain all reserves, deposits and/or escrows
required by Lender or State Agencies applicable from time to time to Borrower or
Operating Lessee by virtue of the nature of Borrower's or Operating Lessee's
business.

         Section 8.9 LEGAL EXISTENCE; NAME, ETC. Borrower, Operating Lessee, and
each member or general partner in Borrower or Operating Lessee, if any, shall
preserve and keep in full force and effect its entity status, franchises, rights
and privileges under the laws of the state of its formation, and all
qualifications, licenses and permits applicable to the ownership, use and
operation of the Projects. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee, nor any member
or general partner of Borrower or Operating Lessee, shall wind up, liquidate,
dissolve, reorganize, merge, or consolidate with or into, or convey, sell,
assign, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
assets. Borrower and each member in Borrower (and Operating Lessee and each
partner in Operating Lessee) shall conduct business only in its own name and
shall not change its name, identity, or organizational structure, or the
location of its chief executive office or principal place of business unless it
(a) shall have obtained the prior written consent of Lender to such change, and
(b) shall have taken all actions necessary or requested by Lender to file or
amend any financing statement or continuation statement to assure perfection and
continuation of perfection of security interests under the Loan Documents. Each
of Borrower (and each member




                                       32
<PAGE>

in Borrower) and Operating Lessee (and each partner in Operating Lessee) shall
maintain its separateness as an entity and shall comply with the requirements of
Section 6.13 and Section 6.14, accordingly.

         Section 8.10 AFFILIATE TRANSACTIONS. Without the prior written consent
of Lender, except for management agreements complying with the provisions
hereof, Borrower and Operating Lessee shall not engage in any transaction
affecting a Project with an Affiliate of Borrower or Operating Lessee, unless
the terms thereof are the same as terms otherwise available in the marketplace
generally.

         Section 8.11 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall
promptly (a) cure any defects in the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents, and (b) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,
all such other documents, agreements and instruments as Lender may reasonably
request to further evidence and more fully describe the collateral for the Loan,
to correct any omissions in the Loan Documents, to perfect, protect or preserve
any liens created under any of the Loan Documents, or to make any recordings,
file any notices, or obtain any consents, as may be necessary or appropriate in
connection therewith.

         Section 8.12 ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES. Borrower, within ten (10) days
after Lender's reasonable request, shall furnish to Lender a written statement,
duly acknowledged, setting forth the amount due on the Loan, the terms of
payment of the Loan, the date to which interest has been paid, whether any
offsets or defenses exist against the Loan and, if any are alleged to exist, the
nature thereof in detail, and such other matters as Lender reasonably may
request.

         Section 8.13 NOTICE OF CERTAIN EVENTS. Borrower and Operating Lessee
shall promptly notify Lender of (a) any Potential Default or Event of Default,
together with a detailed statement of the steps being taken to cure such
Potential Default or Event of Default; (b) any notice of default received by
Borrower under other obligations relating to a Project or otherwise material to
Borrower's business; and (c) any threatened or pending material legal, judicial
or regulatory proceedings, including any dispute between Borrower or Operating
Lessee and any governmental authority, affecting Borrower or Operating Lessee or
a Project.

         Section 8.14 INDEMNIFICATION. Borrower and Operating Lessee, jointly
and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against
any and all losses (other than losses resulting solely from nonpayment of the
Loan), liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever,
including the reasonable fees and actual expenses of Lender's counsel incurred
by Lender, in connection with (a) any inspection, review or testing of or with
respect to the Projects pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any investigative,
administrative, mediation, arbitration, or judicial proceeding, whether or not
Lender is designated a party thereto, commenced or threatened at any time
(including after the repayment of the Loan) in any way related to the execution,
delivery or performance of any Loan Document or to any Project, (c) any
proceeding instituted by any Person claiming a Lien, (d) any brokerage
commissions or finder's fees claimed by any broker or other party in connection
with the Loan, any Project, or any of the transactions contemplated in the Loan
Documents, except commissions and fees arising solely from Lender's actions, (e)
the breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in
any Loan Document, and (f) any professional malpractice or negligence relating
to the operation of




                                       33
<PAGE>

the Projects, including those arising from the joint, concurrent, or comparative
negligence of Lender, except to the extent any of the foregoing is caused by
Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         Section 8.15 ERISA. Each of Borrower and Operating Lessee shall comply
with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder from time to time ("ERISA"), in all
material respects. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower
and Operating Lessee shall cause all or any defined benefit pension plan,
including both single employer and multi-employer plans, subject to Title IV of
ERISA (a "PLAN"), to be funded in accordance with the minimum funding standards
of ERISA, if applicable, and shall make in a timely manner all contributions due
to any Plan.

         Section 8.16 SATISFACTION OF DEBENTURES. On or before August 31, 2002,
either the Debentures shall have been satisfied or ARC shall have provided to

2002, the Debentures shall be satisfied.

         Section 8.17 HCPI TRANSACTION. On or before August 31, 2002, ARC and
ARCSPE shall have consummated the HCPI Transaction.

         Section 8.18 IMMEDIATE REPAIRS. On or before November 30, 2002,
Borrower and Operating Lessee shall complete the Immediate Repairs.

         Section 8.19 DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE AND CASH ON CASH RETURN. Borrower
and Operating Lessee shall at all times maintain a minimum Debt Service Coverage
of 1.10:1 and a minimum Cash on Cash Return of 10.75% per annum.

         Section 8.20 OPERATION. The Projects shall be operated as retirement
communities, independent living units, assisted living units, memory impaired or
Alzheimer units, or skilled nursing beds. The Projects shall be operated using
prudent business judgment and, consistent with such business judgment, in such a
manner so as to maximize the number of Residency Agreements and other occupancy
agreements in effect and to maintain a favorable reputation for the Projects.
Operating Lessee shall fully and faithfully perform, in all material respects,
all of its covenants, agreements and obligations under the Residency Agreements
and under any management agreement (and under any replacement instruments to the
foregoing which are permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.)

         Section 8.21 SERVICES. Operating Lessee shall maintain and continue to
provide throughout the term of the Loan materially the same services to
residents as are currently being provided at the Projects by Borrower or
otherwise on the date a facility becomes a Project. Operating Lessee shall not
materially change such services or reduce the Facility Capacity without the
prior written consent and approval of Lender.

         Section 8.22 NON-COMPETITION. At any time while any portion of the Loan
is outstanding, neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee nor any Affiliate of
Borrower or Operating Lessee shall construct, develop or expand any congregate
care, assisted living, or skilled or intermediate nursing facility or any
combination of such types of facility (a) which is or is to be located within a
five-mile radius of any Project, and (b) which, as determined by Lender in




                                       34
<PAGE>

Lender's sole and absolute discretion (without taking into account the financing
source for such facility), would have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or operations of such Project. Nothing in this Section 8.22 shall
prohibit Borrower or Operating Lessee or any Affiliate of Borrower or Operating
Lessee from acquiring or managing any existing facility, but neither Borrower
nor Operating Lessee nor any Affiliate of Borrower or Operating Lessee shall, in
its marketing efforts, target Residents of any Project for transfers to any
other facility. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall submit proposals for
development of any facility which is to be located within a five-mile radius of
any Project for Lender's determination prior to incurring substantial costs
(excluding costs of demographic or market studies) for or commencing
construction of any such facility, and Lender shall use good faith efforts to
respond to such proposals within a reasonable period of time.

(10) days after notice by Lender to Borrower and Operating Lessee; however,

                                    REMEDIES

         Section 10.1 REMEDIES - INSOLVENCY EVENTS. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default described in Section 9.7 or Section 9.8, the obligations of
Lender to advance amounts hereunder shall immediately terminate, and all amounts
due under the Loan Documents immediately shall become due and payable, all
without written notice and without presentment, demand, protest, notice of
protest or dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate the maturity thereof, notice
of acceleration of the maturity thereof, or any other notice of default of any
kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower and Operating Lessee;
however, if the Bankruptcy Party under Section 9.7 or Section 9.8 is a Person
other than Borrower, then all amounts due under the Loan Documents shall become
immediately due and payable at Lender's election, in Lender's sole discretion.

         Section 10.2 REMEDIES - OTHER EVENTS. Except as set forth in Section
10.1 above, while any Event of Default exists, Lender may (a) by written notice

accelerate the maturity thereof, notice of acceleration of the maturity thereof,
or other notice of default of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived

Documents and at law or in equity.

         Section 10.3 LENDER'S RIGHT TO PERFORM THE OBLIGATIONS. If Borrower or
Operating Lessee shall fail, refuse or neglect to make any payment or perform
any act required by the Loan Documents, then while any Event of Default exists,
and without notice to or demand upon Borrower or Operating Lessee and without
waiving or releasing any other right, remedy or recourse Lender may have because
of such Event of Default, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) make such
payment or perform such act for the account of and at the expense of Borrower
and Operating Lessee, and shall have the right to enter upon the Projects for
such purpose and to take all such action thereon and with respect to the
Projects as it may deem necessary or appropriate. If Lender shall elect to pay
any sum due with reference to a Project, Lender may do so in reliance on any
bill, statement or assessment procured from the appropriate governmental
authority or other issuer thereof without inquiring into the accuracy or
validity thereof. Similarly, in making any payments to protect the security
intended to be created by the Loan Documents, Lender shall not be bound to
inquire into the validity of any apparent or threatened adverse title, lien,
encumbrance, claim or charge before making an advance for the purpose of
preventing or removing the same. Additionally, if any Hazardous Materials affect
or threaten to affect a Project, Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) give
such notices and take such actions as it deems necessary or advisable in order
to abate the discharge of any Hazardous Materials or remove the Hazardous
Materials. Borrower and Operating Lessee, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against any and all losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred or accruing by reason of any acts
performed by Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Section 10.3, including
those arising from the joint, concurrent, or comparative negligence of Lender,
except as a result of Lender's gross negligence or willful misconduct. All sums
paid by




                                       37
<PAGE>

Lender pursuant to this Section 10.3, and all other sums expended by Lender to
which it shall be entitled to be indemnified, together with interest thereon at
the Default Rate from the date of such payment or expenditure until paid, shall
constitute additions to the Loan, shall be secured by the Loan Documents and
shall be paid by Borrower to Lender upon demand.

Any communication so addressed and mailed shall be deemed to be given on the
earliest of (a) when actually delivered, (b) on the first Business Day after
deposit with an overnight air courier service, or (c) on the third Business Day
after deposit in the United States mail, postage prepaid, in each case to the
address of the intended addressee (except as otherwise provided in the
Mortgage), and any communication so delivered in person shall be deemed to be
given when receipted for by, or actually received by Lender or Borrower, as the
case may be. If given by telecopy, a notice shall be deemed given and received
when the telecopy is transmitted to the party's telecopy number specified above,
and confirmation of complete receipt is received by the transmitting party
during normal business hours or on the next Business Day if not confirmed during
normal business hours, and an identical notice is also sent simultaneously by
mail, overnight courier, or personal delivery as otherwise provided in this
Section 11.1. Either party may designate a change of address by written notice
to the other by giving at least ten (10) days prior written notice of such
change of address.

         Section 11.2 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of the Loan Documents shall be effective unless in writing and signed
by the party against whom enforcement is sought.

         Section 11.3 LIMITATION ON INTEREST. It is the intention of the parties
hereto to conform strictly to applicable usury laws. Accordingly, all agreements
between Borrower and Lender or between Operating Lessee and Lender with respect
to the Loan are hereby expressly limited so that in no event, whether by reason
of acceleration of maturity or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be
paid to Lender or charged by Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of the
money to be lent hereunder or otherwise, exceed the maximum amount allowed by
law. If the Loan would be usurious under applicable law (including the laws of
the State and the laws of the United States of America), then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Loan Documents: (a) the aggregate of all
consideration which constitutes interest under applicable law that is contracted
for, taken, reserved, charged or received under the Loan Documents shall under
no circumstances exceed the maximum amount of interest allowed by applicable
law, and any excess shall be credited on the Note by the holder thereof (or, if
the Note has been paid in full, refunded to Borrower); and (b) if maturity is
accelerated by reason of an election by Lender, or in the event of any
prepayment, then any consideration which constitutes interest may never include
more than the maximum amount allowed by applicable law. In such case, excess
interest, if any, provided for in the Loan Documents or otherwise, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, shall be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread
from the date of advance until payment in full so that the actual rate of
interest is uniform through the term hereof. If such amortization, proration,
allocation and spreading is not permitted under applicable law, then such excess
interest shall be canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration or
prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited on the Note (or, if the
Note has been paid in full, refunded to Borrower). The terms and provisions of
this Section 11.3 shall control and supersede every other provision of the Loan
Documents. The Loan Documents are contracts




                                       39
<PAGE>

made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
the State, except that if at any time the laws of the United States of America
permit Lender to contract for, take, reserve, charge or receive a higher rate of
interest than is allowed by the laws of the State (whether such federal laws
directly so provide or refer to the law of any state), then such federal laws
shall to such extent govern as to the rate of interest which Lender may contract
for, take, reserve, charge or receive under the Loan Documents.

         Section 11.4 INVALID PROVISIONS. If any provision of any Loan Document
is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be fully
severable; the Loan Documents shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part thereof;
the remaining provisions thereof shall remain in full effect and shall not be
affected by the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable provision or by its severance
therefrom; and in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision there
shall be added automatically as a part of such Loan Document a provision as
similar in terms to such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision as may be
possible to be legal, valid and enforceable.

         Section 11.5 REIMBURSEMENT OF EXPENSES. Borrower and Operating Lessee
shall pay all expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the Loan, including
fees and expenses of Lender's attorneys, environmental, engineering and other
consultants, and fees, charges or taxes for the recording or filing of Loan
Documents. Borrower and Operating Lessee shall pay all expenses of Lender in
connection with the administration of the Loan, including audit costs,
inspection fees, settlement of condemnation and casualty awards, and premiums
for title insurance and endorsements thereto. Borrower and Operating Lessee
shall, upon request, promptly reimburse Lender for all amounts expended,
advanced or incurred by Lender to collect the Note, or to enforce the rights of
Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to defend or assert
the rights and claims of Lender under the Loan Documents or with respect to the
Projects (by litigation or other proceedings), which amounts will include all
court costs, attorneys' fees and expenses, fees of auditors and accountants, and
investigation expenses as may be incurred by Lender in connection with any such
matters (whether or not litigation is instituted), together with interest at the
Default Rate on each such amount from the date of disbursement until the date of
reimbursement to Lender, all of which shall constitute part of the Loan and
shall be secured by the Loan Documents.

         Section 11.6 APPROVALS; THIRD PARTIES; CONDITIONS. All approval rights
retained or exercised by Lender with respect to leases, contracts, plans,
studies and other matters are solely to facilitate Lender's credit underwriting,
and shall not be deemed or construed as a determination that Lender has passed
on the adequacy thereof for any other purpose and may not be relied upon by
Borrower, Operating Lessee, or any other Person. This Agreement is for the sole
and exclusive use of Lender and Borrower and may not be enforced, nor relied
upon, by any Person other than Lender and Borrower. All conditions of the
obligations of Lender hereunder, including the obligation to make advances, are
imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of Lender, its successors and
assigns, and no other Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such
conditions or be entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make advances in
the absence of strict compliance with any or all of such conditions, and no
other Person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of
such conditions, any and all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part
by Lender at any time in Lender's sole discretion.

         Section 11.7 LENDER NOT IN CONTROL; NO PARTNERSHIP. None of the
covenants or other provisions contained in this Agreement shall, or shall be
deemed to, give Lender the right or power to exercise Control over the affairs
or management of Borrower or Operating Lessee, the power of Lender being limited
to the rights to exercise the remedies referred to in the Loan Documents. The
relationship between Borrower and Lender is, and at all times shall remain,
solely that of debtor and creditor. No covenant or provision of the Loan
Documents is intended, nor shall it be deemed or construed, to create a
partnership, joint venture, agency or common interest in profits or income
between Lender and Borrower, or between Lender and Operating Lessee, or to
create an equity in the Projects in Lender. Lender neither undertakes nor
assumes any responsibility or duty to Borrower, or to Operating Lessee, or to
any other Person with respect to the Projects or the Loan, except as expressly
provided in the Loan Documents; and notwithstanding any other provision of the
Loan Documents: (a) Lender is not, and shall not be construed as, a partner,
joint venturer, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other business
associate or participant of any kind of Borrower or Operating Lessee or their
respective stockholders, members, or partners and Lender does not intend to ever
assume such status; (b) Lender shall in no event be liable for any Debts,
expenses or losses incurred or sustained by Borrower or Operating Lessee; and
(c) Lender shall not be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts,
omissions or decisions of Borrower or Operating Lessee or their respective
stockholders, members, or partners. Lender and Borrower and Operating Lessee
disclaim any intention to create any partnership, joint venture, agency or
common interest in profits or income between Lender and Borrower, or between
Lender and Operating Lessee, or to create an equity in the Projects in Lender,
or any sharing of liabilities, losses, costs or expenses.

         Section 11.8 TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect
to this Agreement.

         Section 11.9 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of Lender, Borrower, and Operating Lessee, and the
successors and assigns of Lender, including any assignee or transferee of the
Note, individually, and the successors and assigns of Borrower and Operating
Lessee, provided that neither Borrower nor any other Borrower Party shall,
without the prior written consent of Lender, assign any rights, duties or
obligations hereunder.

         Section 11.10 RENEWAL, EXTENSION OR REARRANGEMENT. All provisions of
the Loan Documents shall apply with equal effect to each and all promissory
notes and amendments thereof hereinafter executed which in whole or in part
represent a renewal, extension, increase or rearrangement of the Loan.

         Section 11.11 DIVISIONS OF THE LOAN; SYNDICATION OR PLACEMENT. For
portfolio management purposes, Lender may elect to divide the Loan into two or
more separate loans, evidenced by separate promissory notes with senior and
junior priorities, or to syndicate the Loan to a group of lenders, or to sell
the Loan in connection with a securitization, structured finance, or other
placement transaction so long as the payment and other obligations of Borrower
or Operating Lessee are not effectively increase or otherwise modified. Borrower
and Operating Lessee agree to cooperate with Lender and to execute such
documents as Lender reasonably may request to effect any division of the Loan
required by Lender and otherwise to effect any syndication, securitization,
structured finance, or secondary market transaction.

         Section 11.12 WAIVERS. No course of dealing on the part of Lender, its
officers, employees, consultants or agents, nor any failure or delay by Lender
with respect to exercising any right, power or privilege of Lender under any of
the Loan Documents, shall operate as a waiver thereof.

         Section 11.13 CUMULATIVE RIGHTS. Rights and remedies of Lender under
the Loan Documents shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial exercise of
any such right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or
remedy.

         Section 11.14 SINGULAR AND PLURAL. Words used in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents in the singular, where the context so permits, shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa. The definitions of words in the
singular in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall apply to such
words when used in the plural where the context so permits and vice versa.

         Section 11.15 PHRASES. When used in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, the phrase "including" shall mean "including, but not limited to,"

satisfactory to Lender in all respects," the phrase "with Lender's consent" or

agreement between the parties hereto.

         Section 11.18 PROMOTIONAL MATERIAL. Borrower and Operating Lessee
authorize Lender to issue press releases, advertisements and other promotional
materials in connection with Lender's own promotional and marketing activities,
and describing the Loan, in a manner consistent with descriptions of other
financings, and Lender's participation in the Loan. All references to Lender
contained in any press release, advertisement or promotional material issued by
Borrower or Operating Lessee shall be approved in writing by Lender in advance
of issuance.

         Section 11.19 SURVIVAL. All of the representations, warranties,
covenants, and indemnities hereunder (including environmental matters under
Article 4), and under the indemnification provisions of the other Loan Documents

evidencing or securing the Loan, and shall survive the transfer (by sale,
foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise) of any or all
right,



                                       42

(whether verbal or written) or action of either party or any exercise by any
party of their respective rights under the Loan Documents or in any way relating
to the Loan or the Projects (including, without limitation, any action to
rescind or cancel this Agreement, and any claim or defense asserting that this
Agreement was fraudulently induced or is otherwise void or voidable). This
waiver is a material inducement for Lender to enter this Agreement.

         Section 11.21 WAIVER OF PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. Neither
Lender nor Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall be responsible or liable to the
other or to any other Person for any punitive, exemplary or consequential
damages which may be alleged as a result of the Loan or the transaction
contemplated hereby, including any breach or other default by any party hereto.

         Section 11.22 GOVERNING LAW. The Loan Documents are being executed and
delivered, and are intended to be performed, in the State and the laws of the
State and of the United States of America shall govern the rights and duties of
the parties hereto and the validity, construction, enforcement and

in any of the Loan Documents.

         Section 11.23 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents embody the entire agreement and understanding between Lender and

Residency Agreements, in violation of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents; (f) failure of Borrower or Operating Lessee to apply proceeds of

Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right which Lender may have
under Sections 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other provision of the United
States Bankruptcy Code, as such sections may be amended, or corresponding or
superseding sections of the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of

                                     JOINDER

         By executing this Joinder (the "JOINDER"), the undersigned ("JOINDER
PARTIES") jointly and severally guaranty the performance by Borrower and
Operating Lessee of Borrower's and Operating Lessee's unconditional obligation
to pay real estate taxes, assessments and similar charges relating to the

Agreement, Borrower's and Operating Lessee's indemnification obligations under
Section 8.14 of this Agreement, and all obligations and liabilities for which
Borrower and Operating Lessee are personally liable under Section 12.1 of this
Agreement. This Joinder is a guaranty of full and complete payment and
performance and not of collectability.

         1. WAIVERS. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each
Joinder Party waives all rights and defenses of sureties, guarantors,
accommodation parties and/or co-makers and agrees that its obligations under
this Joinder shall be primary, absolute and unconditional, and that its
obligations under this Joinder shall be unaffected by any of such rights or
defenses, including:

                  (a) the unenforceability of any Loan Document against Borrower

                                 SCHEDULE 2.3(E)

                          DISCOUNTED YIELD MAINTENANCE

A.       Yield Maintenance Amount

                  As used in this Schedule 2.3(e), "CONTRACT RATE" means the
                  Fixed Rate.

                  As used herein, "YIELD MAINTENANCE AMOUNT" means the sum of
                  the Present Value (as defined below) on the date of prepayment
                  of each Monthly Interest Shortfall (as defined below) for the
                  remaining term of the Loan discounted at the monthly
                  Replacement Treasury Yield (as defined below).

                  The Monthly Interest Shortfall is calculated for each monthly
                  payment date as follows:

                  i)       The positive difference, if any, of the Contract Rate
                           less the Replacement Treasury Yield, plus the Break
                           Contract Fee (as defined below) of 20 basis points;

                  ii)      Divided by 12;

                  iii)     Multiplied by the outstanding principal balance of
                           the Loan on the date of prepayment

                  The Present Value is then determined by discounting each
                  Monthly Interest Shortfall at the Replacement Treasury Yield
                  divided by 12.

                  FOR EXAMPLE: If a loan with a Contract Rate of 9% were prepaid
                  with 24 months remaining in the term, at a time when the two
                  year Replacement Treasury Yield was 5%, and the outstanding
                  loan balance was $10,000,000.00 then:

Equals the rate difference                                         =     .0420
Divided by 12                                                      /     12

Equals the monthly rate difference                                 =     .0035

Equals the Monthly Interest Shortfall                          =       $35,000
</TABLE>

         The Present Value of each Monthly Interest Shortfall ($35,000)
discounted at the monthly Replacement Treasury Yield (5% divided by 12 or
.4167%) equals $797,786.

              The Break Contract Fee shall be 20 basis points at all times.

         As used herein the term "REPLACEMENT TREASURY YIELD" shall mean the
         rate of interest equal to the yield to maturity of the most recently
         issued U.S. Treasury Security as quoted in The Wall Street Journal on
         the prepayment date. If the remaining term is less than one year, the
         Replacement Treasury Yield will equal the yield for 1-Year Treasury's.
         If the remaining term is 1-Year, 2-Year, etc., then the Replacement
         Treasury Yield will equal the yield for the Treasury's with a maturity
         equaling the remaining term. If the remaining term is longer than one
         year but does not equal one of the maturities being quoted, then the
         Replacement Treasury Yield will equal the yield for Treasury's with a
         maturity closest to but not exceeding the remaining term. If The Wall
         Street Journal (i) quotes more than one such rate, the highest of such
         quotes shall apply, or (ii) ceases to publish such quotes, the U.S.
         Treasury security shall be determined from such financial reporting
         service or source as Lender shall determine.

                          CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS RESERVE

         CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS RESERVE. On the date hereof and by the fifteenth
(15th) day of each January hereafter, Borrower or Operating Lessee shall deposit
into a reserve with Lender the greater of (a) $352,400 ($400 times the number of
units in the Projects subject to reduction of and as the number of units is
reduced), or (b) such higher amount as may be recommended by Lender's consulting
engineer (the "CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS RESERVE") for replacing or correcting
damages or defects (as opposed to normal repairs and recurring expenses) to any
Project, including but not limited to, roofing, foundation work, exterior
painting, parking lot and structures, kitchen appliances, carpeting,
furnishings, fixtures, equipment, vehicles, office equipment, landscaping,
heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems, plumbing, electrical and
mechanical systems ("CAPITAL EXPENDITURES") as specified in a Capital
Expenditures Budget (as hereinafter defined) or otherwise approved in advance by
Lender; however, the amount of the initial deposit into the Capital Improvements
Reserve shall be reduced by the amount of funds expended for capital
improvements to the Projects approved by Lender in calendar year 2002. The
Capital Improvements Reserve will be held by Lender in an interest-bearing
reserve account controlled by Lender. The Capital Improvements Reserve shall be
advanced by Lender to Borrower or Operating Lessee for Capital Expenditures.
Operating Lessee grants to Lender a security interest in the Capital
Improvements Reserve. While an Event of Default or a Potential Default exists,
Lender shall not be obligated to advance to Borrower or Operating Lessee any
portion of the Capital Improvements Reserve, and while an Event of Default
exists, Lender shall be entitled, without notice to Borrower or Operating
Lessee, to apply any funds in the Capital Improvements Reserve to satisfy
Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents. Within thirty (30) days after
the beginning of any calendar year Borrower or Operating Lessee shall submit to
Lender a budget for Capital Expenditures for that calendar year (the "CAPITAL
EXPENDITURES BUDGET"). The Capital Expenditures Budget shall be based on the
previous year's experience and an assessment of anticipated future needs, and
shall be subject to Lender's approval. The Capital Improvements Reserve shall be
advanced in accordance with the conditions for advances under Schedule 2.1, Part
C, and Lender's customary procedures for improvements advances.
