Three-Year Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2001 (the &#147;<U>Credit

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based upon
and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and qualifications
set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as we have deemed
necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of the opinion
that the Credit Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally
and except as the enforceability of the Credit Agreement is subject to the
application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law), including, without limitation, (a) the
possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other
equitable remedy and (b) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and
fair dealing.</P>

<DIR>
<P><FONT face=Times
size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
enforceability of Section 8.04(b) of the Credit Agreement may be limited by laws
limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or exempting a party from,
or requiring indemnification of a party for, its own action or inaction, to the
extent such action or inaction involves gross negligence, recklessness or
willful or unlawful conduct.</P></DIR>
<DIR>
<P><FONT face=Times

circumstances.</P></DIR>
<DIR>
<P><FONT face=Times
size=3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We express no
opinion as to (i) the effect of the laws of any jurisdiction in which any Lender
is located (other than the State of New York) that limit the interest, fees or
other charges such Lender may impose, (ii)&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.15 of the Credit
Agreement, (iii) the second&nbsp;sentence of Section&nbsp;8.07 of the Credit
Agreement, insofar as such sentence relates to the subject matter jurisdiction
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to
adjudicate any controversy related to the Credit Agreement, (iv) the waiver of
inconvenient forum set forth in Section&nbsp;8.07 of the Credit Agreement with
respect to proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and (v) Section 8.08 of the Credit
Agreement.</P></DIR>
