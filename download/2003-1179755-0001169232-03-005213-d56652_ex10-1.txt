the Parent Borrower and each Tranche 3 Lender which has Tranche 3 Revolving
Loans outstanding at such time agree that at 9:00 A.M. (New York time) on the
Commitment Expiration Date, the aggregate principal amount of Tranche 3
Revolving Loans owing to such Tranche 3 Lender and outstanding at such time
shall (unless such Tranche 3 Revolving Loans have been declared (or have become)
due and payable pursuant to this Agreement), upon written notice (or telephonic
notice promptly confirmed in writing) by the Parent Borrower to the
Administrative Agent requesting such conversion, automatically convert to and
thereafter constitute Tranche 3 Term Loans owing to such Tranche 3 Lender
hereunder. The Tranche 3 Term Loans of each Tranche 3 Lender (i) shall be made
and thereafter maintained in Dollars; (ii) shall, at the option of the Parent
Borrower, be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, provided that all Tranche 3
Term Loans comprising the same Borrowing shall, unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, consist of Tranche 3 Term Loans of the same Type; and (iii)
shall not exceed in initial principal amount for such Tranche 3 Lender an amount
which equals the total principal amount of Tranche 3 Revolving Loans owed to
such Tranche 3 Lender and outstanding at 9:00 A.M. (New York time) on the
Commitment Expiration Date. Once repaid, Tranche 3 Term Loans may not be
reborrowed.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 1.01 or elsewhere in this Agreement, each incurrence of Revolving Loans
shall consist of a Borrowing of Tranche 1 Revolving Loans and a Borrowing of
Tranche 3 Revolving Loans, with such Borrowings to be made pro rata on the basis
of the Tranche 1 Revolving Percentage and the Tranche 3 Revolving Percentage, in
each case in effect at the time of such Borrowings.

            1.02 Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing; Maximum Number of Borrowings.
The aggregate principal amount of each Borrowing hereunder shall not be less
than $5,000,000. More than one Borrowing may be incurred on any day; provided
that at no time shall there be outstanding more than ten Borrowings of
Eurodollar Loans in the aggregate for all Tranches.

            1.03 Notice of Borrowing. (a) Whenever the Parent Borrower desires
to incur Revolving Loans, it shall give the Administrative Agent at its Notice
Office, (x) prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time), at least three Business Days'
prior written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of
each Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans or (y) prior to 10:00 A.M. (New York time) on
the day of each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing). Each such notice (a "Notice of
Borrowing"), except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 1.10, shall be
irrevocable, and, in the case of a written notice and a confirmation of
telephonic notice, shall be in the form of Exhibit A hereto, appropriately
completed to specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Loans
to be made pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which
shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the respective Borrowings shall consist
of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans and, if Eurodollar Loans, the Interest
Period to be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly give each Lender written notice (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) of each proposed Borrowing, of such Lender's proportionate
share thereof and of the other matters covered by the Notice of Borrowing.

            (b) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Parent
Borrower to confirm in writing any notice it may give hereunder by telephone,
the Administrative Agent may act prior to receipt of written confirmation
without liability upon the basis of such telephonic notice, believed by the
Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an Authorized Officer of the
Parent Borrower. In each such case the Administrative Agent's record of the
terms of any such telephonic notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            1.04 Disbursement of Funds. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth, no later than 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on the date of each
incurrence of Revolving Loans, each Lender with a Commitment of the respective
Tranche will make available to the Administrative Agent its pro rata share of
each Borrowing requested to be made on such date in the manner provided below.

            (b) Each Lender with a Commitment of the respective Tranche shall
make available all amounts it is to fund under any Borrowing in Dollars and
immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office
and the Administrative Agent will make available to the Parent Borrower as
promptly as practicable by depositing to its account at the Payment Office the
aggregate of the amounts so made available in the type of funds received. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to the
date of any such Borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to
the Administrative Agent


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

its portion of the Borrowing or Borrowings to be made on such date, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available
to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing, and the
Administrative Agent, in reliance upon such assumption, may (in its sole
discretion and without any obligation to do so) make available to the Parent
Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact
made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender and the Administrative
Agent has made available same to the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount from such Lender. If such
Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the Administrative
Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Parent Borrower, and the Parent Borrower shall pay such corresponding amount to
the Administrative Agent within two Business Days. The Administrative Agent
shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Parent Borrower, as the
case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from
the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative
Agent to the Parent Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is recovered
by the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (x) if paid by such
Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate or (y) if paid by the Parent
Borrower, the then applicable rate of interest, calculated in accordance with
Section 1.08(a) or (b), as the case may be, for the respective Revolving Loans.

            (c) Nothing in this Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any
Lender from its obligation to fulfill its commitments hereunder or to prejudice
any rights which the Parent Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of
any default by such Lender hereunder.

            1.05 Notes. (a) The Parent Borrower's obligation to pay the
principal of, and interest on, all of the Loans made to it by each Lender shall
be evidenced in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 12.16 and shall, if requested by such Lender, also be evidenced by (i)
in the case of Tranche 1 Revolving Loans and Tranche 1 Term Loans, a promissory
note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1 with blanks appropriately
completed in conformity herewith (each, a "Tranche 1 Note" and collectively, the
"Tranche 1 Notes") and (ii) in the case of Tranche 3 Revolving Loans and Tranche
3 Term Loans, a promissory note substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2 with
blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (each, a "Tranche 3 Note"
and collectively, the "Tranche 3 Notes").

            (b) The Tranche 1 Note issued to each Tranche 1 Lender that has
requested same shall (i) be executed by the Parent Borrower, (ii) be payable to
the order of such Tranche 1 Lender and be dated the Restatement Effective Date
(or if issued after the Restatement Effective Date, be dated the date of the
issuance thereof), (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Tranche 1
Commitment of such Tranche 1 Lender and be payable in a principal amount equal
to the amount of the Tranche 1 Revolving Loans or Tranche 1 Term Loans, as the
case may be, made by such Tranche 1 Lender and which are outstanding from time
to time, (iv) mature on (x) in the case of Tranche 1 Revolving Loans which are
not elected to be converted by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 1.01(b),
on the Commitment Expiration Date and (y) in the case of Tranche 1 Term Loans,
on the Term Loan Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate
clause of Section 1.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans,
as the case may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment
as provided in Section 4.01 and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02
and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents. Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of a


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Tranche 1 Lender (together with a customary indemnity from such Tranche 1 Lender
in form and substance satisfactory to the Parent Borrower) that a Tranche 1 Note
has been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, the Parent Borrower will issue a
replacement Tranche 1 Note in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of
like tender.

            (c) The Tranche 3 Note issued to each Tranche 3 Lender that has
requested same shall (i) be executed by the Parent Borrower, (ii) be payable to
the order of such Tranche 3 Lender and be dated the Restatement Effective Date
(or if issued after the Restatement Effective Date, be dated the date of the
issuance thereof), (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the Tranche 3
Commitment of such Tranche 3 Lender and be payable in a principal amount equal
to the amount of the Tranche 3 Revolving Loans or Tranche 3 Term Loans, as the
case may be, made by such Tranche 3 Lender and which are outstanding from time
to time, (iv) mature on (x) in the case of Tranche 3 Revolving Loans which are
not elected to be converted by the Parent Borrower pursuant to Section 1.01(b),
on the Commitment Expiration Date and (y) in the case of Tranche 3 Term Loans,
on the Term Loan Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate
clause of Section 1.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans,
as the case may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment
as provided in Section 4.01 and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02
and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents. Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of a Tranche 3 Lender
(together with a customary indemnity from such Tranche 3 Lender in form and
substance satisfactory to the Parent Borrower) that a Tranche 3 Note has been
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated, the Parent Borrower will issue a
replacement Tranche 3 Note in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of
like tender.

            (d) Each Lender will record on its internal records the amount of
each Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and will prior to any
transfer of its Note endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding
principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation
or any error in any such notation shall not affect the Parent Borrower's
obligations in respect of such Loans.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this
Section 1.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to
Lenders which at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No
failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans to the
Parent Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the
Parent Borrower to pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) incurred by the
Parent Borrower which would otherwise be evidenced thereby in accordance with
the requirements of this Agreement. Any Lender which does not have a Note
evidencing its outstanding Loans shall in no event be required to make the
notations otherwise described in preceding clause (c). At any time when any
Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence any of its Loans, the Parent
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the
requested Note in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.

            1.06 Conversions. The Parent Borrower shall have the option to
convert on any Business Day all or a portion at least equal to $1,000,000 of the
outstanding principal amount of its Revolving Loans or Term Loans of one Type
and Tranche, into a Borrowing or Borrowings of the same Tranche but other Type
of Revolving Loans or Term Loans, as the case may be; provided that (i) no
partial conversion of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

outstanding principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans pursuant to such Borrowing
to less than $1,000,000, (ii) Base Rate Loans may not be converted into
Eurodollar Loans if any Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date
of the conversion if the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders have
previously advised the Parent Borrower that conversions will not be permitted
while such Default or Event of Default, as the case may be, remains in
existence, (iii) Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans resulting from this Section 1.06
shall be limited in number as provided in Section 1.02, (iv) Eurodollar Loans
may only be converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, and (v) each such conversion shall be made pro rata
among the Revolving Loans or Term Loans, as the case may be, of each Lender of
the Type and Tranche being converted. Each such conversion shall be effected by
the Parent Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office,
prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time), at least three Business Days' (or one
Business Day's in the case of a conversion into Base Rate Loans) prior written
notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) (each a "Notice of
Conversion") specifying the Revolving Loans or Term Loans to be so converted,
the Type and Tranche of Loans to be converted into and, if to be converted into
a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of any
such proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans.

            1.07 Pro Rata Borrowings. (a) All Borrowings of Revolving Loans
under this Agreement shall be incurred by the Parent Borrower from the Lenders
pro rata on the basis of their Tranche 1 Commitments or Tranche 3 Commitments as
the case may be. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any
default by any other Lender in its obligation to make Revolving Loans hereunder
and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Revolving Loans provided to
be made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to
fulfill its commitments hereunder.

            (b) All Borrowings of Term Loans under this Agreement shall be
incurred by the Parent Borrower from the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their
Tranche 1 Commitments or Tranche 3 Commitments, as the case may be, as in effect
immediately prior to the Commitment Expiration Date.

            1.08 Interest. (a) The unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate
Loan shall bear interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until the
earlier of (i) the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Base
Rate Loan and (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar Loan
pursuant to Section 1.06, at a rate per annum which shall at all times be the
Applicable Margin then in effect for Base Rate Loans plus the Base Rate in
effect from time to time.

            (b) The unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan shall bear
interest from the date of the Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (i) the
maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of such Eurodollar Loan or (ii)
the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan pursuant to Sections
1.06, 1.09 or 1.10(b), as applicable, at a rate per annum which shall at all
times be the Applicable Margin then in effect for Eurodollar Loans plus the
relevant Eurodollar Rate for the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar
Loan.


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

            (c) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of each Loan and any other overdue amount payable hereunder
shall be payable on demand and shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to
the Applicable Margin then in effect for Base Rate Loans of the respective
Tranche plus the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus 2%, provided that
overdue principal in respect of Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest until the
end of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loans at a rate per
annum equal to 2% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to such Eurodollar
Loans.

            (d) Interest shall accrue from and including the date of any
Borrowing to but excluding the date of any repayment thereof and shall be
payable (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, quarterly in arrears on the last
Business Day of each calendar quarter, (ii) in respect of each Eurodollar Loan,
on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of
an Interest Period of six months, on the date occurring three months after the
first day of such Interest Period and (iii) in respect of each Loan, on any
conversion or prepayment (on the amount so converted or prepaid), at maturity
(whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

            (e) All computations of interest hereunder shall be made in
accordance with Section 12.07(b).

            (f) The Administrative Agent, upon determining the interest rate for
any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans for any Interest Period, shall promptly notify
the Parent Borrower and the Lenders thereof.

            1.09 Interest Periods. At the time the Parent Borrower gives a
Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion in respect of the making of, or
conversion into, a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (in the case of the initial
Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on
the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable
to a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans, it shall have the right to elect by giving
the Administrative Agent written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed
in writing) of the Interest Period to be applicable to such Borrowing, which
Interest Period shall, at the option of the Parent Borrower, be a one, two,
three or six month period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
above:

            (i) the initial Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar
      Loans shall commence on the date of such Borrowing (including the date of
      any conversion from a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) and each Interest
      Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Borrowing shall commence on
      the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires;

            (ii) if any Interest Period begins on a day for which there is no
      numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such
      Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last Business Day
      of such calendar month;

            (iii) if any Interest Period would otherwise expire on a day which
      is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
      succeeding Business Day, provided that if any Interest Period would
      otherwise expire on a day which is not a


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

      Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further Business Day
      occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the next
      preceding Business Day;

            (iv) no Interest Period may be elected if it would extend beyond (x)
      in the case of Revolving Loans, the Commitment Expiration Date and (y) in
      the case of Term Loans, the Term Loan Maturity Date; and

            (v) no Interest Period may be selected at any time when a Default or
      Event of Default is then in existence if the Administrative Agent or the
      Required Banks have previously advised the Parent Borrower that the
      selection of Interest Periods will not be permitted while such Default or
      Event of Default, as the case may be, remains in existence.

If upon the expiration of any Interest Period, the Parent Borrower has failed,
or is not permitted, to elect a new Interest Period to be applicable to the
respective Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans as provided above, the Parent Borrower
shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Borrowing into a Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest
Period.

            1.10 Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that (x) in
the case of clause (i) below, the Administrative Agent, or (y) in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii) below, any Lender, shall have determined in good faith
(which determination shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and
binding upon all parties hereto):

            (i) on any date for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest
      Period, that, by reason of any changes arising after the Effective Date
      affecting the interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not
      exist for ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided
      for in the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or

            (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
      reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
      any Eurodollar Loans (other than any increased cost or reduction in the
      amount received or receivable resulting from a change in the rate of taxes
      or similar charges) because of (x) any change since the Effective Date in
      any applicable law, governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order or
      request (whether or not having the force of law), or in the interpretation
      or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or
      governmental rule, regulation, guideline, order or request (such as, for
      example, but not limited to, (A) a change in the basis of taxation of
      payment to any Lender of the principal of, or interest on, the Loans or
      any other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax
      on, or determined by reference to, the net income or net profits of such
      Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized
      or in which its principal office or applicable lending office is located
      or any subdivision thereof or therein), but without duplication of any
      amounts owed to such Lender under Section 4.04(a), or (B) a change in
      official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves
      required under Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of
      the Eurodollar Rate) and/or (y) other circumstances affecting the
      interbank Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in such market;
      or


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

            (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Eurodollar
      Loan has become unlawful by compliance by such Lender in good faith with
      any change since the Effective Date in any law, governmental rule,
      regulation, guideline or order, or the interpretation or application
      thereof, or would conflict with any thereof not having the force of law
      but with which such Lender customarily complies, or has become
      impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after the Effective
      Date which materially adversely affects the interbank Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent in the
case of clause (i) above) shall (x) on such date and (y) within 10 Business Days
of the date on which such event no longer exists give notice (by telephone
confirmed in writing) to the Parent Borrower and to the Administrative Agent of
such determination and the reason therefor (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (x) in
the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available
until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Parent Borrower and the
Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative
Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion given
by the Parent Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet been
incurred shall be deemed rescinded by the Parent Borrower or, in the case of a
Notice of Borrowing, shall, at the option of the Parent Borrower, be deemed
converted into a Notice of Borrowing for Base Rate Loans to be made on the date
of Borrowing contained in such Notice of Borrowing, (y) in the case of clause
(ii) above, the Parent Borrower shall pay to such Lender, within 10 Business
Days following receipt of written demand therefor, such additional amounts (in
the form of an increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest
or otherwise as such Lender shall determine in good faith) as shall be required
to compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts
receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such
Lender, showing the basis for the calculation thereof, which basis shall be
reasonable and consistently applied, submitted to the Parent Borrower by such
Lender shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding upon
all parties hereto) and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Parent
Borrower shall take one of the actions specified in Section 1.10(b) as promptly
as possible and, in any event, within the time period required by law.

            (b) At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Parent Borrower may
(and, in the case of a Eurodollar Loan affected pursuant to Section
1.10(a)(iii), the Parent Borrower shall) either (i) if the affected Eurodollar
Loan is then being made pursuant to a Borrowing, by giving the Administrative
Agent telephonic notice (confirmed promptly in writing) thereof on the same date
that the Parent Borrower was notified by a Lender (or on the next Business Day
if the Parent Borrower received such notice after 3:00 p.m. (New York time))
pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), cancel said Borrowing, convert the
related Notice of Borrowing into one requesting a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans
or require the affected Lender to make its requested Loan as a Base Rate Loan,
or (ii) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least one
Business Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender
to convert each such affected Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided
that if more than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders
must be treated the same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

            (c) If any Lender shall have determined in good faith that after the
Effective Date the adoption or effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or
regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any change in
the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged by law with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by such Lender or its parent corporation
with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, in
each case made subsequent to the Effective Date, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or its parent corporation's capital
or assets as a consequence of such Lender's commitments or obligations hereunder
to a level below that which such Lender or its parent corporation could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's or its parent corporation's policies with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), the Parent Borrower agrees to pay such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or its parent
corporation for such reduction. Each Lender, upon determining in good faith that
any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will
give prompt written notice thereof to the Parent Borrower, which notice shall
set forth the basis of the calculation of such additional amounts, which basis
must be reasonable and consistently applied, although the failure to give any
such notice shall not release or diminish the Parent Borrower's obligations to
pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 1.10(c) upon the subsequent
receipt of such notice.

            1.11 Compensation. The Parent Borrower agrees to compensate each
Lender, upon its written request (which request shall set forth the basis for
requesting such compensation), for all reasonable losses, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but excluding any loss of
anticipated profit with respect to such Loans) which such Lender may sustain:
(i) if for any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative
Agent) a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion (whether or not
withdrawn by the Parent Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section
1.10(a)); (ii) if any repayment, prepayment, assignment or conversion of any of
its Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar
Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the
Parent Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other failure by the Parent
Borrower to repay its Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or (y)
an election made pursuant to Section 1.10(b).

            1.12 Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or
(iii) or Section 4.04 with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the
Parent Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy
considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending office for any Loans
or Letters of Credit affected by such event; provided that such designation is
made on such terms that, in the opinion of such Lender, such Lender and its
lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the
object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of
any such Section. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or postpone any of


                                      -10-

the obligations of the Parent Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in
Section 1.10 or Section 4.04.

            1.13 Replacement of Lenders. (a) Upon the occurrence of any event
giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or Section 4.04
with respect to any Lender which results in such Lender charging to one or more
Borrowers increased costs in excess of those being generally charged by the
other Lenders, (b) if a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender and/or (c) in the
case of a refusal by a Lender to consent to a proposed change, waiver, discharge
or termination with respect to this Agreement which has been approved by the
Required Lenders, the Parent Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or
Event of Default then exists and in accordance with the requirements of Section
12.04(b), to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender"), upon prior written
notice to the Administrative Agent and such Replaced Lender, with one or more
NAIC approved banks or other financial institutions (unless otherwise agreed by
the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent) (none of whom shall constitute
a Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement) reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent (collectively, the "Replacement Lender") or, in the
case of a replacement as provided in the immediately preceding clause (c) of
this Section 1.13 where the consent of the respective Lender is required with
respect to less than all Tranches of its Loans, Letters of Credit or
Commitments, at the option of the Parent Borrower, to replace only the
Commitments, outstanding Letters of Credit and/or outstanding Loans of such
Lender in respect of each Tranche where the consent of such Lender would
otherwise be individually required, with identical Commitments, Letters of
Credit and/or Loans of the respective Tranche provided by the Replacement
Lender, provided that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this
Section 1.13, the Replacement Lender and the Replaced Lender shall enter into
one or more Assignment Agreements pursuant to Section 12.04(b) (and with all
fees payable pursuant to said Section 12.04(b) to be paid by the Replacement
Lender) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the
Commitments and outstanding Loans (or, in the case of the replacement of less
than all the Tranches of Commitments, outstanding Letters of Credit and
outstanding Loans of the respective Replaced Lender, all of the Commitments and
all then outstanding Letters of Credit and Loans relating to the Tranche or
Tranches with respect to which such Lender is being replaced) of the Replaced
Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay to the Replaced Lender in respect
thereof an amount equal to the sum of (A) an amount equal to the principal
amount of, and all accrued but unpaid interest on, all outstanding Loans of the
Replaced Lender under each Tranche with respect to which such Replaced Lender is
being replaced, (B) an amount equal to all Unpaid Drawings that have been funded
by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with all then unpaid
interest with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount equal to all
accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Lender (but only
with respect to the relevant Tranche or Tranches, in the case of the replacement
of less than all Tranches of Loans, Letters of Credit and/or Commitments then
held by the respective Replaced Lender pursuant to Section 3.01; (ii) all
obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Documents owing to the Replaced
Lender (other than those specifically described in clause (i) above in respect
of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently being,
paid), including, without limitation, all amounts owing to the Replaced Lender
under Section 1.11 as a result of the assignment of its Loans under clause (i)
above, shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such
replacement; and (iii) no assignment pursuant to this Section 1.13 shall be
effective until all of the then outstanding Letters of Credit are returned by
each respective beneficiary to the Issuing Agent and either cancelled and/or
exchanged for new or amended


                                      -11-

Letters of Credit which give effect to such assignment (it being understood that
to the extent the respective beneficiaries do not consent to such assignment,
such assignment cannot occur). Upon the execution of the respective Assignment
Agreements, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above and
the return and cancellation and/or exchange of each then outstanding Letter of
Credit as provided above, if so requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to
the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Parent
Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with
respect to indemnification provisions applicable to the Replaced Lender under
this Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.

other Persons which will become Tranche 1 Lenders as provided pursuant to clause
(vi) below) provide Additional Tranche 1 Commitments and, subject to the
applicable terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and the relevant
Additional Tranche 1 Commitment Agreement, make Tranche 1 Revolving Loans and
issue Letters of Credit; it being understood and agreed, however, that (i) no
Tranche 1 Lender shall be obligated to provide an Additional Tranche 1
Commitment as a result of any request by the Parent Borrower, (ii) until such
time, if any, as (x) such Tranche 1 Lender has agreed in its sole discretion to
provide an Additional Tranche 1 Commitment and executed and delivered to the
Administrative Agent an Additional Tranche 1 Commitment Agreement in respect
thereof as provided in Section 1.15(b) and (y) such other conditions set forth
in Section 1.15(b) shall have been satisfied, such Tranche 1 Lender shall not be
obligated to fund any Tranche 1 Revolving Loans, or issue any Letters of Credit,

other Persons which will become Tranche 1 Lenders as provided pursuant to clause
(vi) below) may so provide an Additional Tranche 1 Commitment without the
consent of any other Tranche 1 Lender (it being understood and agreed that the
consent of the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Agent (such consent (in

institutions who will become Tranche 1 Lenders)) of at least $1,000,000 and (y)
the aggregate amount of Additional Tranche 1 Commitments provided pursuant to

not received Additional Tranche 1 Commitments in an aggregate amount equal to
that amount of the Additional Tranche 1 Commitments which the Parent Borrower
desires to obtain pursuant to such request (as set forth in the notice provided
by the Parent Borrower to the Administrative Agent as provided above), then the
Parent Borrower may request Additional Tranche 1 Commitments from other Lenders
and/or other NAIC approved banks or financial institutions (unless otherwise
agreed by the Parent Borrower and the Administrative Agent) in aggregate amount
equal to such deficiency on terms which are no more favorable to such other bank

Tranche 1 Lenders, and (vii) all actions taken by the Parent Borrower pursuant
to this Section 1.15 shall be done in coordination with the Administrative
Agent.

            (b) At the time of any provision of Additional Tranche 1 Commitments

Subsidiary Borrower, the

1 Commitment to occur upon delivery of such Additional Tranche 1 Commitment
Agreement to the Administrative Agent, the payment of any fees required in
connection therewith and the satisfaction of the other conditions in this
Section 1.15 to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative Agent), (ii)
the Parent Borrower shall, in coordination with the Administrative Agent, repay
all outstanding Tranche 1 Revolving Loans of the Lenders, and incur additional
Tranche 1 Revolving Loans from other Tranche 1 Lenders in each case so that the
Tranche 1 Lenders participate in each Borrowing pro rata on the basis of their
respective Tranche 1 Commitments (after giving effect to any increase in the
Total Tranche 1 Commitment pursuant to this Section 1.15) and with the Parent
Borrower being obligated to pay the respective Tranche 1 Lenders the costs of
the type referred to in Section 1.11 in connection with any such repayment
and/or Borrowing, (iii) all the outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of Credit shall
have been returned by each respective beneficiary to the Issuing Agent and shall
either have been cancelled and/or exchanged for new or amended Tranche 1 Letters

account of a U.S. Borrower or U.S. Borrowers, such Additional Tranche 1 Lender

Parent Borrower and each Designated Subsidiary Borrower (if requested) and (vi)
the Parent Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an opinion, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, from
counsel to the Parent Borrower reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent and dated such date, covering such matters similar to those set forth in
the opinions of counsel delivered to the Lenders on the Restatement Effective
Date pursuant to Section 5.01(b) and such other matters as the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Tranche 1 Lender as to the occurrence of each Additional Tranche 1
Commitment Date, and (w) on each such date, the Total Tranche 1 Commitment
under, and for all purposes of, this Agreement shall be increased by the
aggregate amount of such Additional Tranche 1 Commitments, (x) on each such date
Annex I shall be deemed modified to reflect the revised Tranche 1 Commitments of
the affected Tranche 1 Lenders and (y) upon surrender of any old Tranche 1 Notes
by the respective Additional Tranche 1 Lender (or, if lost, a standard lost note
indemnity in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent Borrower),
to the extent requested by any Additional Tranche 1 Lender, a new Tranche 1 Note
will be issued, at the Parent Borrower's expense, to such Additional Tranche 1
Lender, to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05 (with
appropriate modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised Tranche 1
Commitment of such Tranche 1 Lender.

the Parent Borrower shall, in coordination with, and as instructed by, the
Administrative Agent, repay outstanding Existing Revolving Loans of certain of
the Tranche 1 Lenders and incur additional Revolving Loans from certain other
Lenders (including any Lender who has become a Lender on the Restatement
Effective Date), in each case to the extent necessary so that each Tranche 1
Lender and each Tranche 3 Lender, as the case may be, participates in each
outstanding Borrowing of Tranche 1 Revolving Loans and Tranche 3 Revolving
Loans, as the case may be, pro rata on the basis of their respective Tranche 1
Commitments and Tranche 3 Commitments (after giving effect (x) in the case of

the Restatement Effective Date and (y) in the case of such Tranche 3
Commitments, to the provision of the Total Tranche 3 Commitment on the
Restatement Effective Date), and with the Parent Borrower being obligated to pay

connection with any such repayment and/or Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.A. Tranche 1 Letters of Credit.

            2A.01 Tranche 1 Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms
and conditions set forth herein, each Designated Subsidiary Borrower may request
the Issuing Agent, at any time and from time to time after the Restatement
Effective Date and prior to the date which is 30 days prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date, to issue on behalf of the Tranche 1 Lenders, for the account of
such Designated Subsidiary Borrower and in support of, on a standby basis,
Letter of Credit Supportable Obligations and, subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Issuing Agent agrees to issue on behalf of the
Tranche 1 Lenders at any time and from time to time after the Restatement
Effective Date and prior to the date which is 30 days prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date, one or more irrevocable standby letters of credit in such form
as may be approved by the Issuing Agent (each such letter of credit, a "Tranche
1 Letter of Credit" and, collectively, the "Tranche 1 Letters of Credit").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Agent shall be under no obligation to
issue any Tranche 1 Letter of Credit if at the time of such issuance:

            (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
      arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain the Issuing
      Agent from issuing such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit or any requirement of
      law applicable to such Issuing Agent or any Lender or any request or
      directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
      Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Agent or any Tranche 1 Lender
      shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Agent or any Tranche 1 Lender
      refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Tranche
      1 Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the Issuing Agent or
      any Lender with respect to such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit any restriction
      or reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing Agent or any
      Tranche 1 Lender is not otherwise compensated) not in effect on the
      Effective Date, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
      applicable, in effect or known to the Issuing Agent or any Tranche 1
      Lender as of the Effective Date;

            (ii) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02 are not
      satisfied at that time; or


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

            (iii) the Issuing Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower
      or the Required Lenders prior to the issuance of such Tranche 1 Letter of
      Credit of the type described in clause (iv) of Section 2A.01(b).

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 2A. 01 or elsewhere in this Agreement (i) no Tranche 1 Letter of Credit
shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to (x) the Tranche 1
Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Tranche 1 Unpaid Drawings which are
repaid on the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Tranche 1
Letter of Credit) at such time and (y) the aggregate principal amount of all
Tranche 1 Revolving Loans then outstanding, would exceed an amount equal to the
Total Tranche 1 Commitment at such time; (ii) no Tranche 1 Letter of Credit
shall be issued for the account of any Intermediate Holding Company the Stated
Amount of which, when added to (x) the Tranche 1 Letter of Credit Outstandings
in respect of outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of Credit issued for the account of
all Intermediate Holding Companies (exclusive of Tranche 1 Unpaid Drawings in
respect of Tranche 1 Letters of Credit issued for the account of Intermediate
Holding Companies which are repaid on the date of, and prior to the issuance of,
the respective Tranche 1 Letter of Credit) at such time and (y) the Tranche 2
Letter of Credit Outstandings in respect of outstanding Tranche 2 Letters of
Credit issued for the account of all Intermediate Holding Companies, exceeds
$50,000,000, (iii) each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date
occurring not later than one year after such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit's date
of issuance; provided that each such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit may by its terms
automatically renew annually for one additional year unless the Issuing Agent
notifies the beneficiary thereof, in accordance with the terms of such Tranche 1
Letter of Credit, that such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit will not be renewed; (iv)
each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars; and (v) the
Issuing Agent will not issue any Tranche 1 Letter of Credit after it has
received written notice from any Borrower or the Required Lenders stating that a
Default or an Event of Default exists until such time as the Issuing Agent shall
have received a written notice of (x) rescission of such notice from the party
or parties originally delivering the same or (y) a waiver of such Default or
Event of Default by the Required Lenders (or, to the extent provided by Section
12.11, each of the Lenders).

            (c) Each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit will be issued by the Issuing
Agent on behalf of the Tranche 1 Lenders and each Tranche 1 Lender will
participate in each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit pro rata in accordance with its
Tranche 1 Percentage. The obligations of each Tranche 1 Lender under and in
respect of each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit are several, and the failure by any
Tranche 1 Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under any Tranche 1
Letter of Credit shall not affect the obligations of the respective Borrower
toward any other party hereto nor shall any other such party be liable for the
failure by such Tranche 1 Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under
any Tranche 1 Letter of Credit.

            (d) Subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Issuing Agent is hereby authorized by each Designated Subsidiary Borrower and
the Tranche 1 Lenders to arrange for the issuance of any Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit pursuant to Section 2A.01(a) and the amendment of any Letter of Credit
pursuant to Section 1.13, Section 1.15, Section 2A.06 and/or Section 12.04(b)
by:


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

            (i) completing the commencement date and the expiry date of such
      Tranche 1 Letter of Credit;

            (ii) in the case of an amendment increasing or reducing the amount
      thereof, amending such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit in such manner as the
      Issuing Agent and the respective beneficiary may agree;

            (iii) completing such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit with the
      participation of each Tranche 1 Lender as allocated pursuant to the terms
      hereof; and

            (iv) executing such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit on behalf of each
      Tranche 1 Lender and following such execution delivering such Tranche 1
      Letter of Credit to the beneficiary of such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit.

            (e) Each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit shall be executed and delivered
by the Issuing Agent in the name and on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for,
each Tranche 1 Lender party to such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, and the Issuing
Agent shall act under each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, and each Tranche 1 Letter
of Credit shall expressly provide that the Issuing Agent shall act, as the agent
of each Tranche 1 Lender to (a) receive drafts, other demands for payment and
other documents presented by the beneficiary under such Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit, (b) determine whether such drafts, demands and documents are in
compliance with the terms and conditions of such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit and
(c) notify such Tranche 1 Lender and such Designated Subsidiary Borrower that a
valid drawing has been made and the date that the related Tranche 1 Unpaid
Drawing is to be made; provided that the Issuing Agent shall have no obligation
or liability for any Tranche 1 Unpaid Drawing under such Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit, and each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide. Each
Tranche 1 Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the Issuing Agent as
its attorney-in-fact, acting through any duly authorized officer of the Issuing
Agent, to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of such Tranche 1 Lender
each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit to be issued by such Tranche 1 Lender hereunder.
Promptly upon the request of the Issuing Agent, each Tranche 1 Lender will
furnish to the Issuing Agent such powers of attorney or other evidence as any
beneficiary of any Tranche 1 Letter of Credit may reasonably request in order to
demonstrate that the Issuing Agent has the power to act as attorney-in-fact for
such Tranche 1 Lender to execute and deliver such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit.

            2A.02 Tranche 1 Letter of Credit Requests. (a) Whenever a Designated
Subsidiary Borrower desires that a Tranche 1 Letter of Credit be issued, such
Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Agent written notice (including by way of facsimile transmission,
immediately confirmed in writing by submission of the original of such request
by mail to the Issuing Agent) thereof prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) at

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

            (b) The making of each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit Request shall be
deemed to be a representation and warranty by the applicable Designated
Subsidiary Borrower that such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit may be issued in
accordance with, and it will not violate the requirements of, Section 2A.01(a)
or (b).

            (c) Upon its issuance of, or amendment to, any Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Agent shall promptly notify the respective Designated
Subsidiary Borrower and the Tranche 1 Lenders of such issuance or amendment,
which notice shall include a summary description of the Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit actually issued and any amendments thereto.

            2A.03 Agreement to Repay Tranche 1 Letter of Credit Drawings. (a)
Each Designated Subsidiary Borrower agrees to reimburse each Tranche 1 Lender,
by making payment to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at
the Payment Office, for any payment or disbursement made by such Tranche 1
Lender under any Tranche 1 Letter of Credit which has been issued for such
Designated Subsidiary Borrower's account (each such amount so paid or disbursed
until reimbursed, a "Tranche 1 Unpaid Drawing") no later than one Business Day
following the date of such payment or disbursement, with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Lender, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00
P.M. (New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and
including the date paid or disbursed to but not including the date such Tranche
1 Lender is reimbursed therefor at a rate per annum which shall be the Base Rate
plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans as
in effect from time to time (or, if the Total Tranche 1 Commitment has been
terminated and all Tranche 1 Revolving Loans have been repaid or converted to
Tranche 1 Term Loans, the Applicable Margin that would have been in effect for
Tranche 1 Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans) (plus an additional 2%
per annum, payable on demand, if not reimbursed by the third Business Day after
the date of such payment or disbursement).

            (b) Each Designated Subsidiary Borrower's obligation under this
Section 2A.03 to reimburse each Tranche 1 Lender with respect to Tranche 1
Unpaid Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any
setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which such Designated Subsidiary
Borrower may have or have had against such Tranche 1 Lender, or the Issuing
Agent, including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any
drawing under a Tranche 1 Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the
Tranche 1 Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the
beneficiary of the proceeds of such drawing; provided, however, that no
Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse any Tranche 1
Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Tranche 1 Lender under a Tranche 1
Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Tranche 1 Lender (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision).

            2A.04 Increased Costs. If after the Effective Date, the adoption or
effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation, order, guideline or
request or any change therein after the Effective Date, or any change adopted or
effective after the Effective Date in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Tranche
1 Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
by


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall either (i) impose,
modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar
requirement against letters of credit issued by or participated in by such
Tranche 1 Lender, or (ii) impose on such Tranche 1 Lender any other conditions
directly or indirectly affecting this Agreement or any Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Tranche 1 Lender of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Tranche 1
Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Tranche 1 Lender hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital with
respect to Tranche 1 Letters of Credit, then, upon written demand to the
respective Designated Subsidiary Borrower by such Tranche 1 Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), such Designated Subsidiary Borrower agrees to pay
to such Tranche 1 Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Tranche 1 Lender for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate
submitted to the respective Designated Subsidiary Borrower by such Tranche 1
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), setting forth the basis for
the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate
such Tranche 1 Lender as aforesaid shall be final and conclusive and binding on
such Designated Subsidiary Borrower absent manifest error, although the failure
to deliver any such certificate shall not release or diminish any Designated
Subsidiary Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2A.04 upon subsequent receipt of such certificate.

            2A.05 Tranche 1 Letter of Credit Expiration Extensions. Each Tranche
1 Lender acknowledges that to the extent provided under the terms of any Tranche
1 Letter of Credit, the expiration date of such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit will
be automatically extended for an additional year, without written amendment,
unless at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of such Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit, notice is given by the Issuing Agent to the beneficiary of such Tranche
1 Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of the respective Tranche 1
Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Non-Extension") that the expiration date of such
Tranche 1 Letter of Credit will not be extended beyond its current expiration
date. The Issuing Agent will give Notices of Non-Extension as to any or all
outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of Credit if requested to do so by the Required
Lenders pursuant to Section 9. The Issuing Agent will give Notices of
Non-Extension as to all outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of Credit if the
Commitment Expiration Date has occurred. The Issuing Agent will send a copy of
each Notice of Non-Extension to the respective Designated Subsidiary Borrower
concurrently with delivery thereof to the respective beneficiary, unless
prohibited by law from doing so.

            2A.06 Changes to Stated Amount. At any time when any Tranche 1
Letter of Credit is outstanding, at the request of the respective Designated
Subsidiary Borrower, the Issuing Agent will enter into an amendment increasing
or reducing the Stated Amount of such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, provided that
(i) in no event shall the Stated Amount of such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit be
increased to an amount which, when added to (x) the Tranche 1 Letter of Credit
Outstandings at such time and (y) the aggregate principal amount of all Tranche
1 Revolving Loans then outstanding, would exceed an amount equal to the Total
Tranche 1 Commitment, (ii) the Stated Amount of a Tranche 1 Letter of Credit may
not be increased at any time if the conditions precedent set forth in Section
5.02 are not satisfied at such time, and (iii) the Stated Amount of a Tranche 1
Letter of Credit may not be increased at any time after the date which is 30
days prior to the Commitment Expiration Date.

            2A.07 Representations and Warranties of Tranche 1 Lenders. Each
Tranche 1 Lender represents and warrants that each Tranche 1 Letter of Credit
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Tranche 1 Lender
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

            2A.08 Existing Tranche 1 Letters of Credit. (a) Each Tranche 1
Letter of Credit outstanding immediately prior to the Restatement Effective Date
is listed on Annex VIII (each such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, an "Existing
Tranche 1 Letter of Credit"). As soon as possible following the Restatement
Effective Date, each Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit shall be amended to
replace each Original Tranche 1 Lender on such Existing Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit with each Tranche 1 Lender party to this Agreement on the Restatement
Effective Date in accordance with each such Tranche 1 Lender's Tranche 1
Percentage. Until an Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit has been amended in
accordance with this Section 2A.08, each Original Tranche 1 Lender shall be
deemed to have sold and transferred to each Tranche 1 Lender, and each such
Tranche 1 Lender (each, a "Tranche 1 Participant") shall be deemed irrevocably
and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Original Tranche 1
Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation,
to the extent of such Tranche 1 Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage in such
Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, each substitute Existing Tranche 1 Letter
of Credit, each drawing made thereunder, the obligations of any Borrower under
this Agreement with respect thereto and any security therefore or guaranty
pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Tranche 1 Commitments of the Tranche
1 Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 or 12.04(b), it is hereby agreed that, with
respect to all outstanding Existing Tranche 1 Letters of Credit and Unpaid
Drawings with respect thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the
participations pursuant to this Section 2A.08 to reflect the new Tranche 1
Percentages of the assigning and assignee Tranche 1 Lender.

            (b) In determining whether to pay under any Existing Letter of
Credit, no Original Tranche 1 Lender shall have any obligation relative to the
Tranche 1 Participants other than to determine that any documents required to be
delivered under such Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit have been delivered and
that they appear to substantially comply on their face with the requirements of
such Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, which obligation, it is understood, is
being performed by the Issuing Agent, and upon whom each Original Tranche 1
Lender shall be entitled to rely. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by any
Original Tranche 1 Lender under or in connection with any Existing Tranche 1
Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such Original Tranche 1
Lender any resulting liability to any Borrower, any Tranche 1 Lender or any
other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross
negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

            (c) In the event that any Original Tranche 1 Lender makes any
payment under any Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit issued by it and the
respective Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to each
Original Tranche 1 Lender pursuant to Section 2A.03(a), such Original Tranche 1
Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Tranche 1 Participant of such failure, and each
such Tranche 1 Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Original Tranche 1 Lender, the
amount of such Tranche 1 Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage of such payment in
Dollars and in same day funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies any
Tranche 1 Participant required to fund a payment under an Existing


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

Tranche 1 Letter of Credit prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business
Day, such Tranche 1 Participant shall make available to the Administrative Agent
at the Payment Office for the account of the respective Original Tranche 1
Lender such Tranche 1 Participant's Percentage of the amount of such payment on
such Business Day in same day funds (and, to the extent such notice is given
after 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Tranche 1 Participant
shall make such payment on the immediately following Business Day). If and to
the extent such Tranche 1 Participant shall not have so made its Tranche 1
Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the respective Original Tranche 1 Lender, such Tranche 1
Participant agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Original Tranche 1 Lender, forthwith on demand such amount, together with
interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is paid
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Original Tranche 1 Lender at
the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the interest
rate applicable to Tranche 1 Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate
Loans for each day thereafter. The failure of any Tranche 1 Participant to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Original
Tranche 1 Lender its Tranche 1 Percentage of any payment under any Existing
Tranche 1 Letter of Credit issued by it shall not relieve any other Tranche 1
Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of such Original Tranche 1 Lender its Tranche 1 Percentage
of any payment under any such Tranche 1 Letter of Credit on the date required,
as specified above, but no Tranche 1 Participant shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Tranche 1 Participant to make available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Original Tranche 1 Lender such
other Tranche 1 Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage of any such payment.

            (d) Whenever any Original Tranche 1 Lender receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for
the account of such Original Tranche 1 Lender any payments from the Tranche 1
Participants pursuant to Section 2A.08(c), such Original Tranche 1 Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
to each Tranche 1 Participant which has paid its Tranche 1 Percentage thereof,
in Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Tranche 1
Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage of the principal amount thereof and interest
thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.

            (e) The obligations of the Tranche 1 Participants to make payments
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Original Tranche 1
Lender with respect to Existing Tranche 1 Letters of Credit issued by it shall
be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any
other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including,
without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

            (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any
      of the other Credit Documents;

            (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right
      which the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time
      against a beneficiary named in an Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit, any
      transferee of any Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit (or any Person for
      whom any such transferee may be acting), the Administrative


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

      Agent, any Original Tranche 1 Lender, or other Person, whether in
      connection with this Agreement, any Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit,
      the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions
      (including any underlying transaction between the Parent Borrower or any
      of its Subsidiaries and the beneficiary named in any such Existing Tranche
      1 Letter of Credit);

            (iii) any draft, certificate or other document presented under the
      Existing Tranche 1 Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
      invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
      untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

            (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance
      or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

            (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

            SECTION 2B Tranche 2 Letters of Credit.

            2B.01 Tranche 2 Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms
and conditions set forth herein, each Designated Subsidiary Borrower may request
the Issuing Agent, at any time and from time to time after the Restatement
Effective Date and prior to the date which is 30 days prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date, to issue on behalf of the Tranche 2 Lenders, for the account of
such Designated Subsidiary Borrower and in support of, on a standby basis,
Letter of Credit Supportable Obligations and, subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Issuing Agent agrees to issue on behalf of the
Tranche 2 Lenders at any time and from time to time after the Restatement
Effective Date and prior to the date which is 30 days prior to the Commitment
Expiration Date, one or more irrevocable standby letters of credit in such form
as may be approved by the Issuing Agent (each such letter of credit, a "Tranche
2 Letter of Credit" and, collectively, the "Tranche 2 Letters of Credit").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuing Agent shall be under no obligation to
issue any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit if at the time of such issuance:

            (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
      arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain the Issuing
      Agent from issuing such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or any requirement of
      law applicable to such Issuing Agent or any Tranche 2 Lender or any
      request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
      Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Agent or any
      Tranche 2 Lender shall prohibit, or request that the Issuing Agent or any
      Tranche 2 Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally
      or such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon the
      Issuing Agent or any Tranche 2 Lender with respect to such Tranche 2
      Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for
      which the Issuing Agent or any Tranche 2 Lender is not otherwise
      compensated) not in effect on the Effective Date, or any unreimbursed
      loss, cost or expense which was not applicable, in effect or known to the
      Issuing Agent or any Tranche 2 Lender as of the Effective Date;

            (ii) the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02 are not
      satisfied at that time; or


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

            (iii) the Issuing Agent shall have received notice from any Borrower
      or the Required Lenders prior to the issuance of such Tranche 2 Letter of
      Credit of the type described in clause (iv) of Section 2B.01(b).

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 2B.01 or elsewhere in this Agreement, (i) no Tranche 2 Letter of Credit
shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the Tranche 2 Letter
of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Tranche 2 Unpaid Drawings which are repaid
on the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit) at such time would exceed, an amount equal to the Total Tranche 2
Commitment at such time; (ii) no Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall be issued for
the account of any Intermediate Holding Company the Stated Amount of which, when
added to (x) the Tranche 2 Letter of Credit Outstandings in respect of
outstanding Tranche 2 Letters of Credit issued for the account of all
Intermediate Holding Companies (exclusive of Tranche 2 Unpaid Drawings in
respect of Tranche 2 Letters of Credit issued for the account of Intermediate
Holding Companies which are repaid on the date of, and prior to the issuance of,
the respective Tranche 2 Letter of Credit) at such time and (y) the Tranche 1
Letter of Credit Outstandings in respect of outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of
Credit issued for the account of all Intermediate Holding Companies, exceeds
$50,000,000; (iii) each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall have an expiry date
occurring not later than one year after such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit's date
of issuance; provided that each such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit may by its terms
automatically renew annually for one additional year unless the Issuing Agent
notifies the beneficiary thereof, in accordance with the terms of such Tranche 2
Letter of Credit, that such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit will not be renewed; (iv)
each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars; and (v) the
Issuing Agent will not issue any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit after it has
received written notice from any Borrower or the Required Lenders stating that a
Default or an Event of Default exists until such time as the Issuing Agent shall
have received a written notice of (x) rescission of such notice from the party
or parties originally delivering the same or (y) a waiver of such Default or
Event of Default by the Required Lenders (or, to the extent provided by Section
12.11, each of the Lenders).

            (c) Each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit will be issued by the Issuing
Agent on behalf of the Tranche 2 Lenders and each Tranche 2 Lender will
participate in each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit pro rata in accordance with its
Tranche 2 Percentage. The obligations of each Tranche 2 Lender under and in
respect of each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit are several, and the failure by any
Tranche 2 Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under any Tranche 2
Letter of Credit shall not affect the obligations of the respective Borrower
toward any other party hereto nor shall any other such party be liable for the
failure by such Tranche 2 Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under
any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit.

            (d) Subject to and on the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Issuing Agent is hereby authorized by each Designated Subsidiary Borrower and
the Tranche 2 Lenders to arrange for the issuance of any Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit pursuant to Section 2B.01(a) and the amendment of any Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit pursuant to Section 1.13, Section 2B.06 and/or Section 12.04(b) by:

            (i) completing the commencement date and the expiry date of such
      Tranche 2 Letter of Credit;


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

            (ii) in the case of an amendment increasing or reducing the amount
      thereof, amending such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit in such manner as the
      Issuing Agent and the respective beneficiary may agree;

            (iii) completing such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit with the
      participation of each Tranche 2 Lender as allocated pursuant to the terms
      hereof; and

            (iv) executing such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit on behalf of each
      Tranche 2 Lender and following such execution delivering such Tranche 2
      Letter of Credit to the beneficiary of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit.

            (e) Each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall be executed and delivered
by the Issuing Agent in the name and on behalf of, and as attorney-in-fact for,
each Tranche 2 Lender party to such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, and the Issuing
Agent shall act under each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, and each Tranche 2 Letter
of Credit shall expressly provide that the Issuing Agent shall act, as the agent
of each Tranche 2 Lender to (a) receive drafts, other demands for payment and
other documents presented by the beneficiary under such Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit, (b) determine whether such drafts, demands and documents are in
compliance with the terms and conditions of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit and
(c) notify such Tranche 2 Lender and such Designated Subsidiary Borrower that a
valid drawing has been made and the date that the related Tranche 2 Unpaid
Drawing is to be made; provided that the Issuing Agent shall have no obligation
or liability for any Tranche 2 Unpaid Drawing under such Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit, and each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall expressly so provide. Each
Tranche 2 Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and designates the Issuing Agent as
its attorney-in-fact, acting through any duly authorized officer of the Issuing
Agent, to execute and deliver in the name and on behalf of such Tranche 2 Lender
each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit to be issued by such Tranche 2 Lender hereunder.
Promptly upon the request of the Issuing Agent, each Tranche 2 Lender will
furnish to the Issuing Agent such powers of attorney or other evidence as any
beneficiary of any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit may reasonably request in order to
demonstrate that the Issuing Agent has the power to act as attorney-in-fact for
such Tranche 2Lender to execute and deliver such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit.

            2B.02 Tranche 2 Letter of Credit Requests. (a) Whenever a Designated
Subsidiary Borrower desires that a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit be issued, such
Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Agent written notice (including by way of facsimile transmission,
immediately confirmed in writing by submission of the original of such request
by mail to the Issuing Agent) thereof prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) at
least five Business Days (or such shorter period as may be acceptable to the
Issuing Agent) prior to the proposed date of issuance (which shall be a Business
Day), which written notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C-2 (each, a "Tranche
2 Letter of Credit Request"). Each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit Request shall
include any other documents as the Issuing Agent customarily requires in
connection therewith.

            (b) The making of each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit Request shall be
deemed to be a representation and warranty by the applicable Designated
Subsidiary Borrower that such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit may be issued in
accordance with, and it will not violate the requirements of, Section 2B.01(a)
or (b).


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

            (c) Upon its issuance of, or amendment to, any Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit, the Issuing Agent shall promptly notify the respective Designated
Subsidiary Borrower and the Tranche 2 Lenders of such issuance or amendment,
which notice shall include a summary description of the Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit actually issued and any amendments thereto.

            2B.03 Agreement to Repay Tranche 2 Letter of Credit Drawings. (a)
Each Designated Subsidiary Borrower agrees to reimburse each Tranche 2 Lender,
by making payment to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at
the Payment Office, for any payment or disbursement made by such Tranche 2
Lender under any Tranche 2 Letter of Credit which has been issued for such
Designated Subsidiary Borrower's account (each such amount so paid or disbursed
until reimbursed, a "Tranche 2 Unpaid Drawing") no later than one Business Day
following the date of such payment or disbursement, with interest on the amount
so paid or disbursed by such Tranche 2 Lender, to the extent not reimbursed
prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement,
from and including the date paid or disbursed to but not including the date such
Tranche 2 Lender is reimbursed therefor at a rate per annum which shall be the
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Tranche 1 Revolving Loans maintained as
Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time (or, if the Total Tranche 1
Commitment has been terminated and all Tranche 1 Revolving Loans have been
repaid or converted to Tranche 1 Term Loans, the Applicable Margin that would
have been in effect for Tranche 1 Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans)
(plus an additional 2% per annum, payable on demand, if not reimbursed by the
third Business Day after the date of such payment or disbursement).

            (b) Each Designated Subsidiary Borrower's obligation under this
Section 2B.03 to reimburse each Tranche 2 Lender with respect to Tranche 2
Unpaid Drawings (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any
setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment which such Designated Subsidiary
Borrower may have or have had against such Tranche 2 Lender, or the Issuing
Agent, including, without limitation, any defense based upon the failure of any
drawing under a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit to conform to the terms of the
Tranche 2 Letter of Credit or any non-application or misapplication by the
beneficiary of the proceeds of such drawing; provided, however, that no
Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse any Tranche 2
Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Tranche 2 Lender under a Tranche 2
Letter of Credit as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Tranche 2 Lender (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision).

            2B.04 Increased Costs. If after the Effective Date, the adoption or
effectiveness of any applicable law, rule or regulation, order, guideline or
request or any change therein after the Effective Date, or any change adopted or
effective after the Effective Date in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Tranche
2 Lender with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall either (i)
impose, modify or make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or
similar requirement against letters of credit issued by or participated in by
such Tranche 2 Lender, or (ii) impose on such Tranche 2 Lender any other
conditions directly or indirectly affecting this Agreement or any Tranche 2
Letter of


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such
Tranche 2 Lender of issuing, maintaining or participating in any Tranche 2
Letter of Credit, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
such Tranche 2 Lender hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital with
respect to Tranche 2 Letters of Credit, then, upon written demand to the
respective Designated Subsidiary Borrower by such Tranche 2 Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), such Designated Subsidiary Borrower agrees to pay
to such Tranche 2 Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Tranche 2 Lender for such increased cost or reduction. A certificate
submitted to the respective Designated Subsidiary Borrower by such Tranche 2
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), setting forth the basis for
the determination of such additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate
such Tranche 2 Lender as aforesaid shall be final and conclusive and binding on
such Designated Subsidiary Borrower absent manifest error, although the failure
to deliver any such certificate shall not release or diminish any Designated
Subsidiary Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2B.04 upon subsequent receipt of such certificate.

            2B.05 Tranche 2 Letter of Credit Expiration Extensions. Each Tranche
2 Lender acknowledges that to the extent provided under the terms of any Tranche
2 Letter of Credit, the expiration date of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit will
be automatically extended for an additional year, without written amendment,
unless at least 30 days prior to the expiration date of such Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit, notice is given by the Issuing Agent to the beneficiary of such Tranche
2 Letter of Credit in accordance with the terms of the respective Tranche 2
Letter of Credit (a "Notice of Non-Extension") that the expiration date of such
Tranche 2 Letter of Credit will not be extended beyond its current expiration
date. The Issuing Agent will give Notices of Non-Extension as to any or all
outstanding Tranche 2 Letters of Credit if requested to do so by the Required
Lenders pursuant to Section 9. The Issuing Agent will give Notices of
Non-Extension as to all outstanding Tranche 2 Letters of Credit if the
Commitment Expiration Date has occurred. The Issuing Agent will send a copy of
each Notice of Non-Extension to the respective Designated Subsidiary Borrower
concurrently with delivery thereof to the respective beneficiary, unless
prohibited by law from doing so.

            2B.06 Changes to Stated Amount. At any time when any Tranche 2
Letter of Credit is outstanding, at the request of the respective Designated
Subsidiary Borrower, the Issuing Agent will enter into an amendment increasing
or reducing the Stated Amount of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, provided that
(i) in no event shall the Stated Amount of such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit be
increased to an amount which, when added to the Tranche 2 Letter of Credit
Outstandings at such time, would exceed an amount equal to the Total Tranche 2
Commitment, (ii) the Stated Amount of a Tranche 2 Letter of Credit may not be
increased at any time if the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.02 are
not satisfied at such time, and (iii) the Stated Amount of a Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit may not be increased at any time after the date which is 30 days prior to
the Commitment Expiration Date.

            2B.07 Representations and Warranties of Tranche 2 Lenders. Each
Tranche 2 Lender represents and warrants that each Tranche 2 Letter of Credit
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Tranche 2 Lender
enforceable in accordance with its terms.

            2B.08 Existing Tranche 2 Letters of Credit. (a) Each Tranche 2
Letter of Credit outstanding immediately prior to the Restatement Effective Date
is listed on Annex IX


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

(each such Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, an "Existing Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit"). As soon as possible following the Restatement Effective Date, each
Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit shall be replaced by a Tranche 1 Letter of
Credit. Until an Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit has been replaced with a
Tranche 1 Letter of Credit in accordance with this Section 2B.08, each Original
Tranche 2 Lender shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Tranche 1
Participant, and each such Tranche 1 Participant shall be deemed irrevocably and
unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Original Tranche 2
Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation,
to the extent of such Tranche 1 Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage in such
Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, each substitute Existing Tranche 2 Letter
of Credit, each drawing made thereunder, the obligations of any Borrower under
this Agreement with respect thereto and any security therefore or guaranty
pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Tranche 1 Commitments of the Tranche
1 Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 or 12.04(b), it is hereby agreed that, with
respect to all outstanding Existing Tranche 2 Letters of Credit and Unpaid
Drawings with respect thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the
participations pursuant to this Section 2B.08 to reflect the new Tranche 1
Percentages of the assigning and assignee Tranche 1 Lender.

            (b) In determining whether to pay under any Existing Tranche 2
Letter of Credit, no Original Tranche 2 Lender shall have any obligation
relative to the Tranche 1 Participants other than to determine that any
documents required to be delivered under such Existing Tranche 2 Letter of
Credit have been delivered and that they appear to substantially comply on their
face with the requirements of such Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, which
obligation, it is understood, is being performed by the Issuing Agent, and upon
whom each Original Tranche 2 Lender shall be entitled to rely. Any action taken
or omitted to be taken by any Original Tranche 2 Lender under or in connection
with any Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for
such Original Tranche 2 Lender any resulting liability to any Borrower, any
Tranche 1 Lender or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to
be taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

            (c) In the event that any Original Tranche 2 Lender makes any
payment under any Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit issued by it and the
respective Borrower shall not have reimbursed such amount in full to each
Original Tranche 2 Lender pursuant to Section 2B.03(a), such Original Tranche 2
Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each Tranche 1 Participant of such failure, and each
such Tranche 1 Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Original Tranche 2 Lender, the
amount of such Tranche 1 Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage of such payment in
Dollars and in same day funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies any
Tranche 1 Participant required to fund a payment under an Existing Tranche 1
Letter of Credit prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business Day, such
Tranche 1 Participant shall make available to the Administrative Agent at the
Payment Office for the account of the respective Original Tranche 1 Lender such
Tranche 1 Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage of the amount of such payment on
such Business Day in same day funds (and, to the extent such notice is given
after 11:00 A.M. (New York time) on any Business Day, such Tranche 1 Participant
shall make such payment on the immediately following Business Day). If and to
the extent such Tranche 1 Participant shall not have so made its Tranche 1
Percentage of the amount of such payment available to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

respective Original Tranche 2 Lender, such Tranche 1 Participant agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Original Tranche 2 Lender,
forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for each day
from such date until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Original Tranche 2 Lender at the overnight Federal Funds
Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate applicable to Tranche 1
Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter.
The failure of any Tranche 1 Participant to make available to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the respective Original Tranche 2 Lender, its Tranche 1
Percentage of any payment under any Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit issued
by it shall not relieve any other Tranche 1 Participant of its obligation
hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Original Tranche 2 Lender its Tranche 1 Percentage of any payment under any such
Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified above,
but no Tranche 1 Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Tranche 1 Participant to make available to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Original Tranche 2 Lender such other Tranche 1 Participant's
Tranche 1 Percentage of any such payment.

            (d) Whenever any Original Tranche 2 Lender receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which the Administrative Agent has received for
the account of such Original Tranche 2 Lender any payments from the Tranche 1
Participants pursuant to Section 2B.08(c), such Original Tranche 2 Lender shall
pay to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay
to each Tranche 1 Participant which has paid its Tranche 1 Percentage thereof,
in Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Tranche 1
Participant's Tranche 1 Percentage of the principal amount thereof and interest
thereon accruing after the purchase of the respective participations.

            (e) The obligations of the Tranche 1 Participants to make payments
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the respective Original Tranche 2
Lender with respect to Existing Tranche 2 Letters of Credit issued by it shall
be irrevocable and not subject to counterclaim, set-off or other defense or any
other qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all circumstances, including,
without limitation, any of the following circumstances:

                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
            or any of the other Credit Documents;

                  (ii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
            right which the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have
            at any time against a beneficiary named in an Existing Tranche 2
            Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Existing Tranche 2 Letter of
            Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting),
            the Administrative Agent, any Original Tranche 2 Lender, or other
            Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, any Existing
            Tranche 2 Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated herein or
            any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transaction
            between the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and the
            beneficiary named in any such Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit);

<PAGE>

                  (iii) any draft, certificate or other document presented under
            an Existing Tranche 2 Letter of Credit proving to be forged,
            fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
            therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the
            performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit
            Documents; or

                  (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

payments under this Agreement which are made later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
time) shall be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day.
Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
shall be payable during such extension at the applicable rate in effect
immediately prior to such extension.

            4.04 Net Payments. (a) All payments made by any Borrower hereunder
or under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.
Except as provided in Section 4.04(b), all such payments will be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature
now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but
excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed
on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in which the
principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any
subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar
liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
fees, assessments or other charges (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to
collectively, as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrowers
jointly and severally agree to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such
additional amounts as may be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due
under this Agreement or under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on
account of any Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in
such Note. If any amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Borrowers jointly and severally agree to reimburse


                                      -34-
<PAGE>

each Lender, upon the written request of such Lender, for taxes imposed on or
measured by the net income or net profits of such Lender, and franchise taxes
imposed in lieu of taxes imposed on or measured by net income or net profits of
a Lender, pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is
organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such
Lender is located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing
authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which
the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located and
for any withholding of taxes as such Lender shall determine are payable by, or
withheld from, such Lender, in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf
of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts
paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence. The Borrowers
will furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the
payment of any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing such payment by the Borrowers. The Borrowers jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender, and reimburse such
Lender upon its written request, for the amount of any Taxes so levied or
imposed and paid by such Lender.

            (b) Each Lender that is issuing Letters of Credit for the account of
a Designated Subsidiary Borrower organized under the laws of the United States
(each, a "U.S. Borrower") and is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
agrees to deliver to each U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the date that such U.S. Borrower becomes a Designated Subsidiary Borrower
pursuant to Section 1.14, or in the case of a Lender that is issuing Letters of
Credit for the account of a U.S. Borrower and is an assignee or transferee of an
interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.13 or Section 12.04 (unless
the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such
assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such
Lender, or in the case of an Additional Tranche 1 Lender that is issuing Letters
of Credit to a U.S. Borrower (unless the respective Additional Tranche 1 Lender
was already a Tranche 1 Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment of
transfer), on such Additional Tranche 1 Commitment Date, (i) two accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form
W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or
successor forms) certifying to such Lender's entitlement as of such date to a
complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments
to be made under this Agreement and under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not
a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot
deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect
to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) pursuant to clause (i)
above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D (any such
certificate, a "Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y) two accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with
respect to the portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying to
such Lender's entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United
States withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under
this Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender that is lending to a
U.S. Borrower agrees that from time to time after the Effective Date, when a
lapse in time or change in circumstances renders the previous certification
obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, such Lender will deliver to each
U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new accurate and complete
original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN
(with respect to the benefits of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with
respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may
be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with
respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or it shall immediately
notify each U.S. Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to
deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be
required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section
4.04(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.04(a),
but subject to Section 12.04(b) and the immediately succeeding sentence, (x)
each U.S. Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by
law, to deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the United States
(or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from
interest, Fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender
which is not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent that
such Lender has not provided to such U.S. Borrower, the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such deduction or
withholding and (y) no U.S. Borrower shall be obligated pursuant to Section
4.04(a) hereof to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of income
or similar taxes imposed by the United States (I) if such Lender has not
provided to such U.S. Borrower, the Internal Revenue Service Forms required to
be provided to U.S. Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) or (II) in the
case of a payment by the U.S. Borrowers, other than interest, to a Lender
described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such Forms do not establish a
complete exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in this Section
4.04 and except as set forth in Section 12.04(b), the Borrowers jointly and
severally agree to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in
the manner set forth in Section 4.04(a) (without regard to the identity of the
jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts
deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as
a result of any changes that are effective after the Effective Date in any
applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in
the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of such
income or similar taxes.

            (c) Each Lender agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with
legal and regulatory restrictions and subject to overall policy considerations
of such Lender) to file any certificate or document or to furnish to any
Borrower that is not a U.S. Borrower any information as reasonably requested by
such Borrower that may be necessary to establish any available exemption from,
or reduction in the amount of, any Taxes; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 4.04(c) shall require a Lender to disclose any confidential
information (including, without limitation, its tax returns or its Tax
calculations).

with respect to each incurrence of Revolving Loans and (ii) a Letter of Credit
Request meeting the requirements of Section 2.02 with respect to each Letter of

            The occurrence of the Restatement Effective Date shall constitute a
representation and warranty by each Borrower to the Administrative Agent and
each of the Lenders that all the conditions specified in Section 5.01 exist as
of that time. Thereafter, the acceptance of the benefits of each Loan and Letter

qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing in all
jurisdictions where it is required to be so qualified, except, in the case of

power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions

delivered each Credit Document to which it is a party and each such Credit
Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Borrower
enforceable against such Borrower in accordance with its terms, except to the
extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
general principles of equity regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law.

            6.03 No Contravention of Laws, Agreements or Organizational
Documents. Neither the execution, delivery and performance by any Borrower of
this Agreement or the other Documents to which it is a party nor compliance with
the terms and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated therein, (i) will contravene any applicable provision of any law,
statute, rule, regulation, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or
governmental instrumentality, (ii) will conflict or be inconsistent with or
result in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions
of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of
(or the obligation to create or impose) any Lien upon any of the property or
assets of the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms
of, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, credit agreement or
any other material instrument to which the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its property or assets are
bound or to which it may be subject or (iii) will violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.

            6.04 Litigation and Contingent Liabilities. There are no actions,

or other Indebtedness or financing of any Borrower will be used to purchase or
carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying any Margin Stock.

(ii) the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any Document,
has been obtained.

            6.07 Investment Company Act. Neither the Parent Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

            6.09 True and Complete Disclosure; Projections and Assumptions. All
factual information (taken as a whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished
by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Administrative Agent or
any Lender in writing (including, without limitation, all information contained
in the Documents) for purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated herein is, and all other factual information (taken as
a whole with all other such information theretofore or contemporaneously
furnished) hereafter furnished by any such Persons in writing to the
Administrative Agent will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the
date as of which such information is dated and not incomplete by omitting to
state any material fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole
with all other such information theretofore or contemporaneously furnished) not
misleading at such time in light of the circumstances under which such
information was provided. The projections contained in such materials are based
on good faith estimates and assumptions believed by the Parent Borrower to be
reasonable and attainable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders
that such projections as to future events are not to be viewed as facts and that
actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projections may
differ from the projected results.

            6.10 Financial Condition; Financial Statements. (a) The consolidated
balance sheet of the Parent Borrower for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2002
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows, reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, copies of which have been delivered to
each of the Lenders, and the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Parent
Borrower for its fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2003 and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows, copies
of which have been delivered to each of the Lenders, fairly present in all
material respects, in each case, in conformity with GAAP or SAP, as applicable,
consistently applied, the consolidated financial position and results of
operations and cash flows of the Parent Borrower as of such dates and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such periods stated.

            (b) Since December 31, 2002, nothing has occurred which has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.


                                      -41-
<PAGE>

            6.11 Tax Returns and Payments. The Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (i) have timely filed with the appropriate taxing authority (taking
into account any applicable extension within which to file) all material income
and other material tax returns, domestic and foreign, required to be filed by
the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) have paid all material taxes
payable by them which have become due and assessments which have become due,
except for those contested in good faith and adequately disclosed and fully
provided for on the financial statements of the Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance
with GAAP and there is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or
claim now pending or, to the best knowledge of the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, proposed or threatened by any authority regarding taxes relating
to the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Parent Borrower
nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an agreement or waiver or been
requested to enter into an agreement or waiver extending any statute of
limitations relating to the payment or collection of taxes of the Parent
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. No tax Liens have been filed and no claims
are pending or, to the best knowledge of the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, proposed or threatened with respect to any taxes, fees or other
charges for any taxable period.

            6.12 Compliance with ERISA. (a) The Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates have fulfilled their respective obligations
under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with respect to each
Plan and are in compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code,
and have not incurred any liability to the PBGC or any Plan or Multiemployer
Plan (other than to make contributions in the ordinary course of business).

            (b) Each Foreign Pension Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where
required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities. All
contributions required to be made with respect to a Foreign Pension Plan have
been timely made. Neither the Parent Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred any material obligation in connection with the termination of, or
withdrawal from, any Foreign Pension Plan. The present value of the accrued
benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign Pension Plan,
determined as of the end of the Parent Borrower's most recently ended fiscal
year on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which is reasonable, did not
exceed the current value of the assets of such Foreign Pension Plan allocable to
such benefit liabilities (any such excess a "value shortfall"), except for any
such value shortfalls which have not had, or would not reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

            6.13 Subsidiaries. (a) Set forth in Annex III is a complete and
correct list of all of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Borrower as of the
Restatement Effective Date, together with, for each such Subsidiary, (i) the
jurisdiction of organization of such Subsidiary, (ii) each Person holding direct
ownership interests in such Subsidiary and (iii) the percentage of ownership of
such Subsidiary represented by such ownership interests. Except as disclosed in
Annex III, each of the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, free and clear
of Liens, and has the unencumbered right to vote, all outstanding ownership
interests in each Person shown to be held by it in Annex III.


                                      -42-

            (b) There are no restrictions on the Parent Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries which prohibit or otherwise restrict the transfer of cash or other

appoints JPMorgan Chase Bank as Administrative Agent (such term as used in this
Section 11 to include JPMorgan Chase Bank, acting as Issuing Agent under this
Agreement and each Letter of Credit), to act as specified herein and in the
other Credit Documents, and each such Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes
JPMorgan Chase Bank as the Administrative Agent for such Lender, to take such
action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent agrees to act as such upon the
express conditions contained in this Section 11. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or
in the other Credit Documents, nor any fiduciary relationship with any Lender,
and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or otherwise


                                      -72-
<PAGE>

exist against the Administrative Agent. The provisions of this Section 11 are
solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and no
Borrower shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary of any of the
provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement,
the Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Lenders and does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or relationship of
agency or trust with or for any Borrower.

            11.02 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may execute any
of its duties under this Agreement or any other Credit Document by or through
agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall
not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care except to the extent
otherwise required by Section 11.03.

            11.03 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Administrative Agent nor
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be
taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this Agreement (except
for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision)) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Parent Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers contained in this
Agreement, any other Credit Document or in any certificate, report, statement or
other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Credit Document
or for any failure of the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to
ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement, or to inspect the
properties, books or records of the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries.
The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Lender for the
effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, collectibility or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any Credit Document or for any representations,
warranties, recitals or statements made herein or therein or made in any written
or oral statement or in any financial or other statements, instruments, reports,
certificates or any other documents in connection herewith or therewith
furnished or made by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders or by or on behalf
of any Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender or be required to
ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any of the terms,
conditions, provisions, covenants or agreements contained herein or therein or
as to the use of the proceeds of the Loans or of the existence or possible
existence of any Default or Event of Default.

            11.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any
note, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter,
cablegram, telegram, facsimile transmission, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent.


                                      -73-
<PAGE>

The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take
any action under this Agreement or any other Credit Document unless it shall
first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents in accordance with a request of
the Required Lenders, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders.

            11.05 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not be
deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of
Default hereunder unless the Administrative Agent has received notice from a
Lender or a Borrower referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or
Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the
event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice, the Administrative
Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The Administrative Agent
shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders, provided that unless and until
the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

            11.06 Non-Reliance. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that neither
the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates have made any representations or warranties to
it and that no act by the Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any
review of the affairs of the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, shall
be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative
Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent that it
has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
assets, operations, property, financial and other conditions, prospects and
creditworthiness of the Parent Borrower and its Subsidiaries and made its own
decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into this Agreement. Each Lender
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement, and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, assets, operations, property, financial and other
conditions, prospects and creditworthiness of the Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility
to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
business, operations, assets, property, financial and other conditions,
prospects or creditworthiness of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary which may
come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

            11.07 Indemnification. Each Lender agrees to indemnify the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such ratably according to their
respective "percentages" as used in determining the Required Lenders at such
time from and against any and all liabilities,


                                      -74-
<PAGE>

obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
reasonable expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever which may at any
time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the
Obligations) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or any documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or any action taken
or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with
any of the foregoing, but only to the extent that any of the foregoing is not
paid by the Parent Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, provided that no Lender
shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for the payment of any portion of
such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the Administrative
Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). If any indemnity
furnished to the Administrative Agent for any purpose shall, in the opinion of
the Administrative Agent, be insufficient or become impaired, the Administrative
Agent may call for additional indemnity and cease, or not commence, to do the
acts indemnified against until such additional indemnity is furnished. The
agreements in this Section 11.07 shall survive the payment of all Obligations.

            11.08 The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. The
Administrative Agent and its affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Parent Borrower and its
Subsidiaries as though not acting as Administrative Agent hereunder. With
respect to the Loans made by it and all Obligations owing to it, the
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement
as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" shall include the Administrative
Agent in its individual capacity.

            11.09 Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
resign as the Administrative Agent upon 20 days' notice to the Lenders and the
Borrowers. Upon such resignation, the Required Lenders shall, with the consent
of the Parent Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), appoint
from among the Lenders a successor Administrative Agent for the Lenders,
whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
the Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall include such
successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the resigning Administrative
Agent's rights, powers and duties as the Administrative Agent shall be
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement. After the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as the Administrative Agent, the
provisions of this Section 11 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this
Agreement.

            SECTION 12. Miscellaneous.

            12.01 Payment of Expenses, etc. The Borrowers hereby jointly and
severally agree to: (i) whether or not the transactions herein contemplated are
consummated, pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the

Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders in connection with the enforcement
of the Credit Documents and the documents and instruments referred to therein

and consultants for the Administrative Agent and for each of the Lenders); (iv)
pay and hold each of the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present
and future stamp and other similar taxes with respect to the foregoing matters
and save each of the Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities
with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission to pay such taxes; and
(v) indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents (each, an
"indemnified person") from and hold each of them harmless against any and all
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (collectively, "Claims")
incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way related
to, or by reason of, any investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether
or not the Administrative Agent or any Lender is a party thereto) related to the
entering into and/or performance of any Credit Document or the use of the
proceeds of any Loans hereunder or the consummation of any other transactions
contemplated in any Credit Document, including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with any
such investigation, litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by
reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be
indemnified (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable decision)).

            12.02 Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any
such rights, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, each
Lender is hereby authorized at any time or from time to time, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind to any Borrower or to
any other Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and
to appropriate and apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by such Lender (including, without
limitation, by branches and agencies of such Lender wherever located) to or for
the credit or the account of any Borrower against and on account of the
Obligations and liabilities of any such Borrower to such Lender or any other
Lender under this Agreement or under any of the other Credit Documents,
including, without limitation, all interests in Obligations of any such Borrower
purchased by such Lender or any other Lender pursuant to Section 12.06(b), and
all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected with
this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand hereunder and although said Obligations,
liabilities or claims, or any of them, shall be contingent or unmatured. Each
Lender is hereby designated the agent of all other Lenders for purposes of
effecting set off pursuant to this Section 12.02 and each Borrower hereby grants
to each Lender for such Lender's own benefit and as agent for all other Lenders
a continuing security interest in any and all deposits, accounts or moneys of
the Borrowers maintained from time to time with such Lender.

<PAGE>

            12.03 Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including telegraphic, telex, facsimile or cable communication) and mailed,
telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered, if to a Borrower, at the
address specified opposite its signature below; if to any Lender, at its address
specified for such Lender on Annex II hereto; or, at such other address as shall
be designated by any party in a written notice to the other parties hereto. All
such notices and communications shall be mailed, telegraphed, telexed,
telecopied, cabled or sent by overnight courier and shall be effective when
received.

            12.04 Benefit of Agreement. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and
assigns of the parties hereto; provided, however, no Borrower may assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Lenders. Each Lender may at any time grant participations in any
of its rights hereunder or under any of its Notes to any bank or other financial
institution; provided that in the case of any such participation, the
participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or any of the other
Credit Documents, including rights of consent, approval or waiver (the
participant's rights against such Lender in respect of such participation to be
those set forth in the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the
participant relating thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrowers hereunder
shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold such participation, except
that the participant shall be entitled to receive the additional amounts under
Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.04 and 4.04 of this Agreement to, and only to, the extent
that such Lender would be entitled to such benefits if the participation had not
been entered into or sold; and provided, further, that no Lender shall transfer,
grant or assign any participation under which the participant shall have rights
to approve any amendment to or waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document except to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) extend the
final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note in which such participant is
participating or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest
thereon or Fees, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or increase such
participant's participating interest in any Commitment or Loan over the amount
thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or
Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not
constitute a change in the terms of any Commitment and that an increase in any
Commitment shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if such
participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof) or (ii)
consent to the assignment or transfer by any Borrower of any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or any other Credit Document except in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof.

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender may assign all or a
portion of its rights and obligations hereunder to a NAIC approved bank or other
financial institution (unless otherwise agreed by the Parent Borrower and the
Administrative Agent) with the prior written consent of each of (i) the
Administrative Agent, (ii) in the case of an assignment of Tranche 1 Commitments
or Tranche 2 Commitments (and/or the related obligations under such respective
Tranche), the Issuing Agent and (iii) so long as no Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, the Parent Borrower (such consent, in each case,
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). No assignment of less than all of a
Lender's rights and obligations hereunder pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall, to the extent such transaction represents an assignment to an
institution other than one or more Lenders hereunder, be in an aggregate amount
less than the minimum of $5,000,000 unless otherwise agreed to by


                                      -77-
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent and the Parent Borrower in writing and no assignment
shall be effective until all the then outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of Credit or
Tranche 2 Letters of Credit, as the case may be, are returned by each respective
beneficiary to the Issuing Agent either for cancellation and/or to be exchanged
for new or amended Letters of Credit which give effect to such assignment. If
any Lender so sells or assigns all or a part of its rights hereunder or under
the Notes, any reference in this Agreement or the Notes to such assigning Lender
shall thereafter refer to such Lender and to the respective assignee to the
extent of their respective interests and the respective assignee shall have, to
the extent of such assignment (unless otherwise provided therein), the same
rights and benefits as it would if it were such assigning Lender. Each
assignment pursuant to this Section 12.04(b) shall be effected by the assigning
Lender and the assignee Lender executing an Assignment Agreement (appropriately
completed). At the time of any such assignment, (i) Annex I shall be deemed to
be amended to reflect the Commitments, if any, and outstanding Loans, if any, of
the respective assignee (which shall result in a direct reduction to the
Commitments, if any, and outstanding Loans, if any, of the assigning Lender) and
of the other Lenders, (ii) if any such assignment occurs after the Restatement
Effective Date, at the request of the assignor or the assignee, the Parent
Borrower will issue new Notes to the respective assignee and to the assigning
Lender in conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05, (iii) all then
outstanding Tranche 1 Letters of Credit or Tranche 2 Letters of Credit, as the
case may be, shall be returned by each respective beneficiary to the Issuing
Agent either for cancellation and/or to be exchanged for new or amended Letters
of Credit to reflect such assignment (it being understood that to the extent the
respective beneficiaries do not consent to such assignment, such assignment
cannot occur) and (iv) the Administrative Agent shall receive from the assigning
Lender and/or the assignee Lender or financial institution at the time of each
assignment the payment of a nonrefundable assignment fee of $3,500, provided
that such transfer or assignment will not be effective until recorded by the
Administrative Agent on the Register pursuant to Section 12.16 hereof. At the
time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 12.04(b) to a Person which (x)
is not already a Lender hereunder, (y) is not a United States person (as such
term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for Federal income tax
purposes and (z) is issuing Letters of Credit for the account of a U.S.
Borrower, the respective assignee Lender shall provide to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent the appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms (and, if
applicable a Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section 4.04(b). Each
Lender and each Borrower agrees to execute such documents (including, without
limitation, amendments to this Agreement and the other Credit Documents) as
shall be necessary to effect the foregoing. Promptly following any assignment
pursuant to this Section 12.04(b), the assigning Lender shall promptly notify
the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent thereof. Nothing in this Section
12.04 shall prevent or prohibit any Lender from pledging its Loans or Notes
hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender
from such Federal Reserve Bank.

            (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 12.04, no
transfer or assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender hereunder
or any grant of participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer,
assignment or grant would require any Borrower to file a registration statement
with the SEC or to qualify the Loans under the "Blue Sky" laws of any State of
the United States.

            (d) Each Lender initially party to this Agreement hereby represents,
and each Person that becomes a Lender pursuant to an assignment permitted by
clause (b) above will upon


                                      -78-
<PAGE>

its becoming party to this Agreement represent, that it is a commercial lender,
other financial institution or other "accredited investor" (as defined in SEC
Regulation D) which makes loans in the ordinary course of its business or is
acquiring the Loans without a view to distribution of the Loans within the
meaning of the federal securities laws, and that it will make or acquire Loans
for its own account in the ordinary course of such business, provided that,
subject to the preceding clauses (a) through (c), the disposition of any
promissory notes or other evidences of or interests in Indebtedness held by such
Lender shall at all times be within its exclusive control.

            12.05 No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and no course of dealing
between any Borrower and the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies herein expressly provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Administrative
Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Borrower
in any case shall entitle such Borrower to any other or further notice or demand
in similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action in any
circumstances without notice or demand.

            12.06 Payments Pro Rata. (a) The Administrative Agent agrees that
promptly after its receipt of each payment from or on behalf of each Borrower in
respect of any Obligations of such Borrower, it shall distribute such payment to
the Lenders (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive its
pro rata share of such payment) pro rata based upon their respective shares, if
any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was received.

            (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise) which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans or Fees, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums
received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such
Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such
Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such
receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash
without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the
Obligations of the respective Borrower to such Lenders in such amount as shall
result in a proportional participation by all of the Lenders in such amount,
provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter
recovered from such Lender, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

            12.07 Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements to be
furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with GAAP or SAP, as the case may be, consistently applied throughout
the periods involved (except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise
disclosed in writing by the Borrowers to the Lenders). In addition, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, all computations determining compliance
with


                                      -79-
<PAGE>

Section 8, including definitions used therein, shall utilize accounting
principles and policies in effect from time to time; provided that (i) if any
such accounting principle or policy (whether GAAP or SAP or both) shall change
after the Effective Date, the Borrowers shall give reasonable notice thereof to
the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders and if within 30 days following
such notice any Borrower, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders shall
elect by giving written notice of such election to the other parties hereto,
such computations shall not give effect to such change unless and until this
Agreement shall be amended pursuant to Section 12.11 to give effect to such
change, and (ii) if at any time the computations determining compliance with
Section 8 utilize accounting principles different from those utilized in the
financial statements then being furnished to the Lenders pursuant to Section
7.01, such financial statements shall be accompanied by reconciliation
work-sheets.

            (b) All computations of interest on Loans and Fees hereunder shall
be made on the actual number of days elapsed over (i) a year of 365/366 days for
interest on Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is based on
the Prime Lending Rate and (ii) a year of 360 days in all cases other than that
set forth in the preceding clause (i).

            12.08 GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE. (a) THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE

HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION TO SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS AND FURTHER
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS WAS IN ANY
WAY INVALID OR INEFFECTIVE. NOTHING HEREIN


                                      -80-
<PAGE>

SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO SERVE
PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR

            (b) EACH BORROWER AND EACH LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY

            12.09 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each

executed by all the parties hereto shall be lodged with the Parent Borrower and
the Administrative Agent.

            12.10 Headings Descriptive. The headings of the several sections and
subsections of this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not in
any way affect the meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

            12.11 Amendment or Waiver. Neither this Agreement nor any other
Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or termination is
in writing signed by each Borrower and the Required Lenders, provided that no
such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall, without the consent of each
Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) directly affected thereby, (i) extend
the scheduled final maturity of any Loan or Note, or extend the required payment
date of a reimbursement obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit, or extend
the Commitment Termination Date, or extend the stated expiration date of any
Letter of Credit beyond the Final Maturity Date, or reduce the rate or extend
the time of payment of interest on any Loan or Note (except in connection with
the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates), or
reduce the principal amount of any Loan or Note, or reduce the amount or extend
the time of payment of any Fee (it being understood that any amendment or
modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement or to Section
12.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or reduction
in the amount of Fees for purposes of this clause (i)), (ii) except as set forth
in Section 1.15, increase the Commitment of any Lender over the amount thereof
then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of
Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not constitute
a change in the terms of any Commitment of any Lender), (iii) amend, modify or
waive any provision of this Section 12.11 (except for technical amendments with
respect to additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement which
afford the protections to such additional extensions of credit of the type
provided to the Loans and the Commitments on the Effective Date), (iv) reduce
any percentage specified in, or otherwise modify, the definition of Required
Lenders (it being understood that


                                      -81-
<PAGE>

(A) the Additional Tranche 1 Commitments (and the additional Tranche 1 Revolving
Loans incurred in connection therewith) and (B) with the consent of the Required
Lenders, other additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement, in
each case, may be included in the determination of the Required Lenders on
substantially the same basis as the extensions of Loans and Commitments are
included on the Effective Date), (v) release the Parent Borrower from its
obligations under the Parent Borrower Guaranty or (vi) consent to the assignment
or transfer by any Borrower of any of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement. No provision of Section 2 or any other provision relating to the

            12.12 Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including, without
limitation, in Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.04, 4.04, 11.07 or 12.01 shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of the Loans, the
repayment of the Obligations and the termination of the Total Commitment.

            12.13 Domicile of Loans. Each Lender may transfer and carry its
Loans at, to or for the account of any branch, office, Subsidiary or affiliate
of such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to
the extent that a transfer of Loans pursuant to this Section 12.13 would, at the
time of such transfer, result in increased costs under Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.04
or 4.04 from those being charged by the respective Lender prior to such
transfer, then the Parent Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased
costs (although the Parent Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other
increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the
date of the respective transfer).

            12.14 Confidentiality. (a) Each Lender shall (i) hold all non-public
information (including, without limitation, all financial projections and
analyses) furnished by any Borrower in connection with such Lender's evaluation
of whether to become a Lender hereunder or obtained by such Lender pursuant to
the requirements of this Agreement ("Confidential Information") confidential,
(ii) use Confidential Information only for purposes related to this Agreement
and its position as a Lender hereunder and (iii) not disclose such Confidential
Information other than as provided herein; provided that any Lender and/or its
affiliates may disclose any such Confidential Information (A) as has become
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure in
violation of this Section 12.14, (B) as has become available to such Lender or
any such affiliate on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Borrowers and their respective affiliates, provided that the source is not known
by such Lender to be prohibited from transmitting such information to such
Lender by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation, (C) as may be required
or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal,
state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over
such Lender and/or its affiliates, (D) as may be required or appropriate in
respect to any summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation or other
judicial process (it being understood that, to the extent reasonably practicable
under the circumstances, each Borrower shall be given prior notice and an
opportunity to contest any proposed disclosure pursuant to this clause (D)), (E)
in order to comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such
Lender and/or its affiliates, and (F) to any permitted prospective or actual
syndicate member or participant in any Loans, provided that such prospective or
actual syndicate member or participant agrees with the


                                      -82-
<PAGE>

respective assigning Lender to be bound by the provisions of this Section 12.14.
The provisions of this Section 12.14 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Lender (and
any employee, representative or other agent of such Lender) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation of any kind, such Lender's U.S. federal
income tax treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the
transactions contemplated hereby relating to such Lender and all materials of
any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it
relating to such tax treatment and tax structure. However, no disclosure of any
information relating to such tax treatment or tax structure may be made to the
extent nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable
securities laws.

            12.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE CREDIT
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.

            12.16 Register. Each Borrower hereby designates the Administrative
Agent to serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section 12.16, to
maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will record the Commitments
from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders
and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each
Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation
shall not affect the obligations of the Parent Borrower in respect of such
Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such
Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made
pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is
recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to
ownership of such Commitments and Loans and prior to such recordation all
amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Loans shall
remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer of
all or part of any Commitments and any Loans shall be recorded by the
Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the
Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment Agreement
pursuant to Section 12.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment
Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration of
assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note
evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same aggregate
principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or
the new Lender. Each Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent from
and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of whatsoever
nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 12.16 (but
excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the
extent incurred by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Administrative Agent (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
final and non-appealable decision)).

            SECTION 13. Parent Borrower Guaranty.

            13.01 The Guaranty. In order to induce the Lenders to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and in recognition of the direct
benefits to be received by the Parent Borrower from the proceeds of the Loans
and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, the Parent Borrower hereby agrees
with the Lenders as follows: the Parent Borrower hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full
and prompt payment when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise,
of any and all of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations of each Designated
Subsidiary Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors. If any or all of the Parent
Borrower Guaranteed Obligations of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower to the
Guaranteed Creditors becomes due and payable hereunder, the Parent Borrower
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors,
or order, on demand, together with any and all expenses which may be incurred by
the Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed
Obligations. This Parent Borrower Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection. If a claim is ever made upon any Guaranteed Creditor for repayment
or recovery of any amount or amounts received in payment or on account of any of
the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations and any of the aforesaid payees
repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any judgment, decree or order
of any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over such payee or any
of its property or (ii) any settlement or compromise of any such claim effected
by such payee with any such claimant, then and in such event the Parent Borrower
agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or compromise shall be
binding upon the Parent Borrower, notwithstanding any revocation of this Parent
Borrower Guaranty or any other instrument evidencing any liability of any
Designated Subsidiary Borrower, and the Parent Borrower shall be and remain
liable to the aforesaid payees hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered
to the same extent as if such amount had never originally been received by any
such payee.

            13.02 Bankruptcy. Additionally, the Parent Borrower unconditionally
and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of the Parent Borrower
Guaranteed Obligations of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower hereunder to the
Guaranteed Creditors whether or not due or payable by any Designated Subsidiary
Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section 9.05 with
respect to such Designated Subsidiary Borrower, and unconditionally promises to
pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors, or order, on demand, in
lawful money of the United States.

            13.03 Nature of Liability. The liability of the Parent Borrower
hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of
the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower
whether executed by the Parent Borrower, any other guarantor or by any other
party, and the liability of the Parent Borrower hereunder is not affected or
impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by each Designated
Subsidiary Borrower or by any other party (other than a direction by the
Guaranteed Creditor receiving such payment), or (b) any other continuing or
other guaranty, undertaking or maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other
party as to the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations of each Designated
Subsidiary Borrower, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other
guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase,
decrease or change in personnel by any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, or (e)
any payment made to the


                                      -84-
<PAGE>

Guaranteed Creditors on the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations which any
such Guaranteed Creditor repays to any Designated Subsidiary Borrower pursuant
to court order in any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or
other debtor relief proceeding, and the Parent Borrower waives any right to the
deferral or modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such
proceeding or (f) any action or inaction of the type described in Section 13.05.

            13.04 Independent Obligation. The obligations of the Parent Borrower
under this Section 13 are independent of the obligations of any other guarantor,
any other party or any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, and a separate action or
actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Parent Borrower whether or not
action is brought against any other guarantor, any other party or any Designated
Subsidiary Borrower and whether or not any other guarantor, any other party or
any Designated Subsidiary Borrower be joined in any such action or actions. The
Parent Borrower waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting its liability under this Section 13 or the
enforcement thereof. Any payment by any Designated Subsidiary Borrower or other
circumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to any
Designated Subsidiary Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations
as to the Parent Borrower.

            13.05 Authorization. The obligations of the Parent Borrower under
this Section 13 shall be unconditional and absolute and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by any action taken by any Guaranteed Creditor to:

            (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change
      or extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter,
      any of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations (including any increase
      or decrease in the rate of interest thereon), any security therefor, or
      any liability incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof, and the
      Parent Borrower Guaranty herein made shall apply to the Parent Borrower
      Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed or altered;

            (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Parent Borrower
      Guaranteed Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender,
      realize upon or otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any
      property by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or
      howsoever securing, the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations or any
      liabilities (including any of those hereunder) incurred directly or
      indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and/or any offset there against;

            (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against any
      Designated Subsidiary Borrower or others or otherwise act or refrain from
      acting;

            (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, any
      Designated Subsidiary Borrower or other obligors;

            (e) settle or compromise any of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed
      Obligations, any security therefor or any liability (including any of
      those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or
      hereof, and may subordinate the payment of all or any


                                      -85-
<PAGE>

      part thereof to the payment of any liability (whether due or not) of any
      Designated Subsidiary Borrower to its creditors other than the Guaranteed
      Creditors;

            (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any
      liability or liabilities of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower to the
      Guaranteed Creditors regardless of what liability or liabilities of any
      Designated Subsidiary Borrower remain unpaid;

            (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or
      default under, this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any of the
      instruments or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise
      amend, modify or supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document or
      any of such other instruments or agreements; and/or

            (h) take any other action which would, under otherwise applicable
      principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of
      the Parent Borrower from its liabilities under this Parent Borrower
      Guaranty.

            13.06 Reliance. It is not necessary for the Guaranteed Creditors to
inquire into the capacity or powers of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower or the
officers, directors, partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their
behalf, and any Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations made or created in
reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed
hereunder.

            13.07 Subordination. Any indebtedness of any Designated Subsidiary
Borrower now or hereafter owing to the Parent Borrower is hereby subordinated to
the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower
owing to the Guaranteed Creditors; and if the Administrative Agent so requests
at a time when an Event of Default exists, no Designated Subsidiary Borrower
shall make, or be permitted to make, any payment to the Parent Borrower in
respect of such indebtedness owed to the Parent Borrower, but without affecting
or impairing in any manner the liability of the Parent Borrower under the other
provisions of this Parent Borrower Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by the Parent
Borrower of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any of the indebtedness
of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower to the Parent Borrower, the Parent
Borrower shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the
same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Parent Borrower hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that
it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise
have as a result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations
have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.

            13.08 Waiver. (a) The Parent Borrower waives any right (except as
shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived) to require any
Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against each Designated Subsidiary Borrower,
any other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any
security held from any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, any other guarantor or
any other party or (iii) pursue any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's
power whatsoever. The Parent Borrower waives any defense based on or arising out
of any defense of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower, any other guarantor or any
other party, other than payment in full of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed
Obligations, based on or arising out of


                                      -86-
<PAGE>

the disability of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower, any other guarantor or
any other party, or the unenforceability of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause
of the liability of any Designated Subsidiary Borrower other than payment in
full of the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations. The Guaranteed Creditors
may, at their election, foreclose on any security held by the Administrative
Agent or any other Guaranteed Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial
sales, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable
(to the extent such sale is permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other
right or remedy the Guaranteed Creditors may have against any Designated
Subsidiary Borrower or any other party, or any security, without affecting or
impairing in any way the liability of the Parent Borrower hereunder except to
the extent the Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations have been paid. The Parent
Borrower waives any defense arising out of any such election by the Guaranteed
Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right
of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of the Parent Borrower
against any Designated Subsidiary Borrower or any other party or any security.

            (b) The Parent Borrower waives all presentments, demands for
performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of
nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance
of this Parent Borrower Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or
incurring of new or additional Parent Borrower Guaranteed Obligations. The
Parent Borrower assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed
of each Designated Subsidiary Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of
all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Parent
Borrower Guaranteed Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks
which the Parent Borrower assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the
