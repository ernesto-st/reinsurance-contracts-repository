DURATION

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">12.1 Duration. This Agreement shall continue in force until such time that the Reinsurer&#146;s
liability with respect to all Policies and Post-Closing Policies reinsured hereunder is
terminated pursuant to Section&nbsp;12.2.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">12.2 Reinsurer&#146;s Liability. The liability of the Reinsurer under this Agreement with
respect to any Policy or Post-Closing Policy will begin simultaneously with that of the
Company, but not prior to the Effective Date. The Reinsurer&#146;s liability with respect to any Policy will terminate on the earliest of: (a)
the date such Policy or Post-Closing Policy is recaptured in accordance with Section&nbsp;9.4; or
(b)&nbsp;the date the Company&#146;s liability on such Policy or Post-Closing Policy is terminated in accordance with its terms. Termination of
the Reinsurer&#146;s liability under clauses (a)&nbsp;and (b)&nbsp;herein is subject to the Company&#146;s actual
receipt of payments which discharge such liability in full in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. In no event shall the interpretation of this Section&nbsp;12.2 imply a unilateral
right of the Reinsurer to terminate this Agreement.
