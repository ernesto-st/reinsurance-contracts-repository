The purchase price for the Affected Lender&#8217;s or Non-Funding Lender&#8217;s Commitments and Loans shall equal any and all amounts outstanding and owed by the Borrower to the Affected Lender or Non-Funding Lender, as applicable, including principal, prepayment premium or fee, and all accrued and unpaid interest or fees.   </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#167;4.15</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Delay in Requests</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.

No remedy herein conferred upon the Agent or the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or any other provision of law.

The Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) calendar days&#8217; prior written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower.  Any such resignation may at the Agent&#8217;s option also constitute the Agent&#8217;s resignation as the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender.  Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders, subject to the terms of &#167;18.1, shall have the right to appoint as a successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, any Lender or any bank whose senior debt obligations are rated not less than &#8220;A&#8221; or its equivalent by Moody&#8217;s or not less than &#8220;A&#8221; or its equivalent by S&amp;P and which has a net worth of not less than $500,000,000.00.  Unless a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, such successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, shall be reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.  If no successor Agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within ten (10) days after the retiring Agent&#8217;s giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be any Lender or any bank whose senior debt obligations are rated not less than &#8220;A2&#8221; or its equivalent by Moody&#8217;s or not less than &#8220;A&#8221; or its equivalent by S&amp;P and which has a net worth of not less than $500,000,000.00.  Upon the acceptance of any appointment as the Agent and, if applicable, the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender, hereunder by a successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, such successor Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, and the retiring Agent and, if applicable, Issuing Lender and Swing Loan Lender, shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder as the Agent and, if applicable, the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender.  After any retiring Agent&#8217;s resignation, the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Swing Loan Lender.  If the resigning Agent shall also resign as the Issuing Lender, such successor Agent shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or shall make other arrangements satisfactory to the current Issuing Lender, in either case, to assume effectively the obligations of the current Agent with respect to such Letters of Credit.  Upon any change in the Agent under this Agreement, the resigning Agent shall execute such assignments of and amendments to the Loan Documents as may be necessary to substitute the successor Agent for the resigning Agent.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#167;14.10</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Duties in the Case of Enforcement</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Agent reasonably determines payment is in the best interest of all the Lenders, the Agent may without the approval of the Lenders pay taxes and insurance premiums and spend money for maintenance, repairs or other expenses which may be necessary to be incurred, and the Agent shall promptly thereafter notify the Lenders of such action.  Each Lender shall, within thirty (30) days of request therefor, pay to the Agent its Commitment Percentage of the reasonable costs incurred by the Agent in taking any such actions hereunder to the extent that such costs shall not be promptly reimbursed to the Agent by the Borrower or the Guarantors or out of the Collateral within such period.

The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent (or Issuing Lender, as applicable) may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent (or Issuing Lender, as applicable) shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan or issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower, and/or the Guarantors and/or the Approved JVs), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#167;14.13</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Approvals</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.  If consent is required for some action under this Agreement, or except as otherwise provided herein an approval of the Lenders, the Majority Lenders, the Required Revolving Credit Lenders or the Required Term Loan Lenders is required or permitted under this Agreement, each Lender agrees to give the Agent, within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the request for action from the Agent together with all reasonably requested information related thereto (or such lesser period of time required by the terms of the Loan Documents), notice in writing of approval or disapproval (collectively, &#8220;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Directions</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#8221;) in respect of any action requested or proposed in writing pursuant to the terms hereof.  To the extent that any Lender does not approve any recommendation of the Agent, such Lender shall in such notice to the Agent describe the actions that would be acceptable to such Lender.  If consent is required for the requested action, any Lender&#8217;s failure to respond to a request for Directions within the required time period shall be deemed to constitute a Direction to take such requested action.  In the event that any recommendation is not approved by the requisite number of Lenders and a subsequent approval on the same subject matter is requested by the Agent, then for the purposes of this paragraph each Lender shall be required to respond to a request for Directions within five (5) Business Days of receipt of such request.  The Agent and each Lender shall be entitled to assume that any officer of the other Lenders delivering any notice, consent, certificate or other writing is authorized to give such notice, consent, certificate or other writing unless the Agent and such other Lenders have otherwise been notified in writing.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#167;14.14</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">The Borrower Not Beneficiary</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.

In connection with each assignment, the assignee shall represent and warrant to the Agent, the assignor and each other Lender as to whether such assignee is controlling, controlled by, under common control with or is not otherwise free from influence or control by, the Borrower and/or any Guarantor and whether such assignee is a Defaulting Lender or an Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Default exists hereunder, no assignment pursuant to this &#167;18.1 shall be to another real estate investment trust which owns and/or operates healthcare facilities and could reasonably be considered a competitor of the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (a &#8220;Competitor REIT&#8221;); provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. </font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#167;18.2</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Register</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.

The Agent and each Lender agrees for itself that it shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with its customary procedures to hold confidential all non-public information obtained from the Borrower or any Guarantor that has been identified in writing as confidential by any of them, and shall use reasonable efforts in accordance with its customary procedures to not disclose such information to any other Person, it being understood and agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent and/or a Lender may make (a) disclosures to its participants (provided such Persons are advised of the provisions of this &#167;18.7), (b) disclosures to its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, accountants, appraisers, legal counsel and other professional advisors of the Agent or such Lender (provided that such Persons who are not employees of the Agent or such Lender are advised of the provision of this &#167;18.7), (c) disclosures customarily provided or reasonably required by any potential or actual bona fide assignee, transferee or participant or their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, accountants, appraisers, legal counsel and other professional advisors in connection with a potential or actual assignment or transfer by such Lender of any Loans or any participations therein (provided such Persons are advised of the provisions of this &#167;18.7), (d) disclosures to bank regulatory authorities or self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such Lender, or (e) disclosures required or requested by any other Governmental Authority or representative thereof or pursuant to legal process; provided that, unless specifically prohibited by Applicable Law or court order, the Agent or the applicable Lender, as the case may be, shall notify the Borrower of any request by any Governmental Authority or representative thereof prior to disclosure by the Agent or such Lender (other than any such request in connection with any examination or oversight of such Lender by such Governmental Authority or other requests by regulators that are not part of an examination) for disclosure of any such non-public information prior to disclosure of such information.  In addition, each Lender may make disclosure of such information to any contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual counterparty&#8217;s professional advisors (so long as such contractual counterparty or professional advisors agree to be bound by the provisions of this &#167;18.7).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall disclose such non-public information to a Competitor REIT in connection with any such proposed assignment or participation unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or the Borrower has consented to such disclosure (or is deemed to have consented pursuant to &#167;18.1). In addition, the Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments. Non-public information shall not include any information which is or subsequently becomes publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure of such information by a Lender or the Agent, or prior to the delivery to the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, is within the possession of the Agent or such Lender if such information is not known by the Agent or such Lender to be subject to another confidentiality agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to the Borrower or the Guarantors, is or becomes available to the Agent, any Lender or any of their Affiliates on a non-confidential basis, or is disclosed with the prior approval of the Borrower or the Guarantors.

The Agent shall promptly notify the remaining Lenders that each of such Lenders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire a portion of the Loans and Commitment, pro rata based upon their relevant Commitment Percentages, of the Non-Consenting Lender (or if any of such Lenders does not elect to purchase its pro rata share, then to such remaining Lenders in such proportion as approved by the Agent).  In the event that the Lenders do not elect to acquire all of the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s Loans and Commitment, then the Agent shall endeavor to find a new Lender or Lenders to acquire such remaining Loans and Commitment.  Upon any such purchase of the Loans and Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender, the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s interests in the Obligations and its rights hereunder and under the Loan Documents shall terminate at the date of purchase, and the Non-Consenting Lender shall promptly execute and deliver any and all documents reasonably requested by the Agent to surrender and transfer such interest, including, without limitation, an Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and such Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s original Note.  If such Non-Consenting Lender does not execute and deliver to the Agent a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and/or such other documentation reasonably requested by the Agent to surrender and transfer such interest to the purchaser or assignee thereof within a period of time deemed reasonable by the Agent after the later of (i) the date on which such purchaser or assignee executes and delivers such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and/or such other documentation and (ii) the date on which the Non-Consenting Lender receives all payments required to be paid to it by this &#167;18.8, then such Non-Consenting Lender shall, to the extent permissible by Applicable Law, be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and/or such other documentation as of such date and the Borrower shall be entitled (but not obligated) to execute and deliver such Assignment and Acceptance Agreement and/or such other documentation on behalf of such Non-Consenting Lender.  Notwithstanding anything in this &#167;18.8 to the contrary, any Lender or other Lender assignee acquiring some or all of the assigned Loans and Commitment of the Non-Consenting Lender must consent to the proposed amendment, modification or waiver. The purchase price for the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s Loans and Commitment shall equal any and all amounts outstanding and owed by the Borrower to the Non-Consenting Lender, including principal and all accrued and unpaid interest or fees, plus any applicable amounts payable pursuant to &#167;4.7 which would be owed to such Non-Consenting Lender if the Loans were to be repaid in full on the date of such purchase of the Non-Consenting Lender&#8217;s Loans and Commitment (</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">provided</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#32;that the Borrower may pay to such Non-Consenting Lender any interest, fees or other amounts (other than principal) owing to such Non-Consenting Lender).</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;padding-bottom:16px;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">&#167;18.9</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Amendments to Loan Documents</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.

The remedies of the Agent shall include, without limitation, all rights and remedies specified in the Loan Documents and this Assignment, all remedies of the Agent under applicable general or statutory law, and the remedies of a secured party under the UCC, regardless of whether the UCC has been enacted or enacted in that form in any other jurisdiction in which such right or remedy is asserted.  In addition to such other remedies as may exist from time to time, whether by way of set off, banker&#8217;s lien, consensual security interest or otherwise, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Agent is authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to or demand upon Assignor (any such notice or demand being expressly waived by Assignor) to charge any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing by the Agent to or for the credit of or the account of Assignor against any and all of the Secured Obligations, irrespective of whether or not the Agent shall have made any demand for payment and although such Secured Obligations may be unmatured.  Any notice required by law, including, but not limited to, notice of the intended disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral, shall be reasonable and properly given if given in the manner prescribed for the giving of notice herein, and, in the case of any notice of disposition, if given at least ten (10) days prior to such disposition.  The Agent may require Assignor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at any place to be designated by the Agent which is reasonably convenient to both parties.  It is expressly understood and agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to dispose of the Collateral at any public or private sale or sales, without recourse to judicial proceedings and without either demand, appraisement, advertisement or notice (except as such notice as is otherwise required under this Assignment) of any kind, all of which are expressly waived, and that the Agent shall be entitled to bid and purchase at any such sale.  In the event that the Agent is the successful bidder at any public or private sale of any note or other document or instrument evidencing Assignor&#8217;s right to receive a Distribution, the Agent shall be entitled to credit the amount bid by the Agent against the obligations evidenced by such note, document or instrument rather than the Secured Obligations.  In the event that the Agent is the successful bidder at any public or private sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof, the amount bid by the Agent may be credited against the Secured Obligations as provided in the Credit Agreement.  To the extent the Collateral consists of marketable securities, the Agent shall not be obligated to sell such securities for the highest price obtainable, but shall sell them at the market price available on the date of sale. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of the Collateral if it shall determine not to do so regardless of the fact that notice of sale of the Collateral may have been given.  The Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the same was so adjourned.  Each such purchaser at any such sale shall hold the Collateral sold absolutely free from claim or right on the part of Assignor.  In the event that any consent, approval or authorization of any governmental agency or commission will be necessary to effectuate any such sale or sales, Assignor shall execute all such applications or other instruments as the Agent may deem reasonably necessary to obtain such consent, approval or authorization.  The Agent may notify any account debtor or obligor with respect to the Collateral to make payment directly to the Agent, and may demand, collect, receipt for, settle, compromise, adjust, sue for, foreclose or realize upon the Collateral as the Agent may determine whether or not the Secured Obligations or the Collateral are due, and for the purpose of realizing the Agent&#8217;s rights therein, the Agent may receive, open and dispose of mail addressed to Assignor and endorse notes, checks, drafts, money orders, documents of title or other evidences of payment, shipment or storage of any form of Collateral on behalf and in the name of Assignor, as its attorney in fact.  In addition, Assignor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Agent its true and lawful attorney-in-fact either in the name of the Agent or Assignor to (i) sign Assignor&#8217;s name on any Collateral, drafts against account debtors, assignments, any proof of claim in any bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding involving any account debtor, any notice of lien, claim of lien or assignment or satisfaction of lien, or on any financing statement or continuation statement under the UCC; (ii) send verifications of accounts receivable to any account debtor; and (iii) in connection with a transfer of the Collateral as described above, sign in Assignor&#8217;s name any documents necessary to transfer title to the Collateral to the Agent or any third party.  All acts of said attorney in fact are hereby ratified and approved and the Agent shall not be liable for any mistake of law or fact made in connection therewith.  This power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable so long as any amounts remain unpaid on any of the Secured Obligations.  All remedies of the Agent shall be cumulative to the full extent provided by law, all without liability except to account for property actually received, but the Agent shall have no duty to exercise such rights and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing.  Pursuit by the Agent of certain judicial or other remedies shall not abate nor bar other remedies with respect to the Secured Obligations or to other portions of the Collateral.  The Agent may exercise its rights to the Collateral without resorting or regard to other collateral or sources of security or reimbursement for the Secured Obligations.  In the event that any transfer tax, deed tax, conveyance tax or similar tax is payable in connection with the foreclosure, conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise of the Membership Interests or other Collateral, Assignor shall pay such amount to the Agent upon demand and if Assignor fails to pay such amount on demand, the Agent may advance such amount on behalf of Assignor and the amount thereof shall become a part of the Secured Obligations and bear interest at the Default Rate until paid.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:96px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:96px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">(b)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">If Assignor fails to perform any agreement or covenant contained in this Assignment beyond any applicable period for notice and cure, the Agent may itself perform, or cause to be performed, any agreement or covenant of Assignor contained in this Assignment which Assignor shall fail to perform, and the cost of such performance, together with any expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees actually incurred (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees incurred in any appeal) by the Agent in connection therewith, shall be payable by Assignor upon demand and shall constitute a part of the Secured Obligations and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:96px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:96px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">(c)</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">Whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and whether or not the Agent is the absolute owner of the Collateral, the Agent may take such action as the Agent may deem necessary to protect the Collateral or its security interest therein, the Agent being hereby authorized to pay, purchase, contest and compromise any encumbrance, charge or lien which in the reasonable judgment of the Agent appears to be prior or superior to its security interest, and in exercising any such powers and authority to pay necessary expenses, employ counsel and pay reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees.

No delay or omission of the Agent to exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall exhaust or impair any such right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default, or acquiescence therein; and every right, power and remedy given by this Assignment to the Agent may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Agent.  Failure on the part of the Agent to complain of any act or failure to act which constitutes an Event of Default, irrespective of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by the Agent of the Agent&#8217;s rights hereunder or impair any rights, powers or remedies consequent on any Event of Default.  Assignor hereby waives to the extent permitted by law all rights which Assignor has or may have under and by virtue of the UCC and any federal, state, county or municipal statute, regulation, ordinance, Constitution or charter, now or hereafter existing, similar in effect thereto providing any right of Assignor to notice and to a judicial hearing prior to seizure by the Agent of any of the Collateral.

In view of the position of Assignor in relation to the Collateral, or because of other current or future circumstances, a question may arise under the Securities Laws or the Organizational Agreements of the Companies with respect to any disposition of the Collateral permitted hereunder.  Assignor recognizes that the Organizational Agreements of the Companies strictly limit transfers of the Membership Interests, and the admission of substitute members or partners to the Companies.  Assignor understands that compliance with the Securities Laws and the Organizational Agreements of the Companies might very strictly limit the course of conduct of the Agent if the Agent were to attempt to dispose of all or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof, and might also limit the extent to which or the manner in which any subsequent transferee of any Collateral could dispose of the same.  Similarly, there may be other legal restrictions or limitations affecting the Agent in any attempt to dispose of all or part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof under applicable Blue Sky or other state securities laws or similar Applicable Law analogous in purpose or effect.  Assignor recognizes that in light of the foregoing restrictions and limitations the Agent may, with respect to any sale of the Collateral, limit the purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire such Collateral for their own account, for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof and who are able to satisfy any conditions or requirements set forth in the Organizational Agreements of the Companies and the Agent may sell the Collateral in parcels and at such times and to such Persons as the Agent may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with such conditions or requirements.  Assignor acknowledges and agrees that in light of the foregoing restrictions and limitations, the Agent in its sole and absolute discretion may, in accordance with Applicable Law and the Organizational Agreements of the Companies, (a) proceed to make such a sale whether or not a registration statement for the purpose of registering such Collateral or part thereof shall have been filed under the Securities Laws (b) approach and negotiate with a single potential purchaser to effect such sale and (c) sell the Collateral in parcels and at such times and in such manner to such Persons as the Agent may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with such conditions and requirements.  Assignor acknowledges and agrees that any such sale might result in prices and other terms less favorable to the seller if such sale were a public sale without such restrictions.  In the event of any such sale, the Agent shall incur no responsibility or liability for selling all or any part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms hereof at a price that the Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, may in good faith deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as aforesaid or if more than a single purchaser were approached or if all the Collateral were sold at a single sale.  Assignor further agrees that any sale or sales by the Agent of the Collateral made as provided in this Section 16 shall be commercially reasonable.  The provisions of this Section 16 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Agent sells.  The Agent and the Lenders shall not be liable to Assignor for any loss in value of the Collateral by reason of any delay in the sale of the Collateral.</font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;padding-left:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;"><br></font></div><div style="line-height:120%;text-align:justify;text-indent:48px;font-size:12pt;"><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">17.</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;text-decoration:underline;">Governing Law; Terms</font><font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:12pt;">.
