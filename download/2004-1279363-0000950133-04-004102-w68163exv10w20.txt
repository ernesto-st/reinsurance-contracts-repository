      2.5   Renegotiation

            The parties to this Agreement shall have the right to renegotiate
            the terms and conditions of this Agreement in the event applicable
            local, state or federal law, regulations or policy are altered from
            those existing at the time of this Agreement in order to be in
            continuous compliance therewith. This Section shall not limit the
            right of the parties to this Agreement from renegotiating or
            amending other terms and conditions of this agreement. Such changes
            shall only be made with the consent of the parties and the prior
            approval of the SDOH and the DHHS.

      2.6   Assignment and Subcontracting

            a)    The Contractor shall not, without LDSS and SDOH's prior
                  written consent, assign, transfer, convey, sublet, or
                  otherwise dispose of this Agreement; of the Contractor's
                  right, title, interest, obligations, or duties under the
                  Agreement; of the Contractor's power to execute the Agreement;
                  or, by power of attorney or otherwise, of any of the
                  Contractor's rights to receive monies due or to become due
                  under this Agreement. Any assignment, transfer, conveyance,
                  sublease, or other disposition without LDSS and SDOH's consent
                  shall be void.

            b)    Contractor may not enter into any subcontracts related to the
                  delivery of services to Enrollees, except by written
                  agreement, as set forth in Section 22 of this Agreement. The
                  Contractor may subcontract for provider services and
                  management services. If such written agreement would be
                  between Contractor and a provider of health care or ancillary
                  health services or between Contractor and an independent
                  practice association, the agreement must be in a form
                  previously approved by SDOH. If such subcontract is for
                  management services under 10 NYCRR Section 98-1.11, it must be
                  approved by SDOH prior to its becoming effective. Any
                  subcontract entered into by Contractor shall fulfill the
                  requirements of 42 CFR Parts 434 and 438 that are appropriate
                  to the service or activity delegated under such subcontract.
                  Contractor agrees that it shall remain legally responsible to
                  LDSS for carrying out all activities under this Agreement and
                  that no subcontract shall limit or terminate Contractor's
                  responsibility.

                              person owning or controlling more than five
                              percent (5%) of the Contractor's equity, or has an
                              employment, consulting, or other agreement with

                              services that are significant to the Contractor's
                              contractual obligation who has been debarred or
                              suspended by the federal, state or local
                              government, or otherwise excluded from

                  ii)   The LDSS will notify the Contractor of its intent to
                        terminate this Agreement for the Contractor's failure to

                        Contractor with a hearing prior to the termination.

                  iii)  If SDOH suspends, limits or revokes Contractor's
                        Certificate of Authority under PHL Section 4404, this
                        Agreement shall expire on the date the Contractor ceases
                        to have authority to serve the geographic area of the
                        LDSS. No hearing will be required if the contract
                        expires due to SDOH suspension, limitation or revocation
                        of the Contractor's Certificate of Authority.

                  Contractor fail to reach agreement on the monthly Capitation
                  Rates. In such event, the party exercising its right shall
                  give the other party, LDSS, and SDOH written notice specifying
                  the reason for and the effective date of termination, which

                        of this Agreement that is not cured within twenty (20)
                        days, or to such longer period as the parties may agree,

                  ii)   The Contractor shall have the right to terminate this
                        Agreement in the event that its obligations are

                        services pursuant to this Agreement because of a natural
                        disaster and/or an act of God to such a degree that
                        Enrollees cannot obtain reasonable access to services
                        within the Contractor's organization, and, after
                        diligent efforts, the Contractor cannot make other
                        provisions for the delivery of such services. The
                        Contractor shall give LDSS written notice of any such
                        termination that specifies:

                        A)    the reason for the termination, with appropriate
                              documentation of the circumstances arising from a
                              natural disaster and/or an act of God that
                              preclude reasonable access to services;

                        B)    the Contractor's attempts to make other provision
                              for the delivery of services; and

                                    SECTION 2
                    (AGREEMENT TERM, AMENDMENTS, EXTENSIONS,
                AND GENERAL CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION PROVISIONS)

<PAGE>

                        C)    the effective date of the termination, which shall
                              not be less time than will permit an orderly
                              disenrollment of Enrollees to the Medicaid fee-
                              for-service payment mechanism or transfer to
                              another MCO, as determined by LDSS, but no more
                              than ninety (90) days.

            d)    Termination Due To Loss of Funding

                  In the event that State and/or Federal funding used to pay for
                  services under this Agreement is reduced so that payments
                  cannot be made in full, this Agreement shall automatically
                  terminate, unless both parties agree to a modification of the
                  obligations under this Agreement. The effective date of such
                  termination shall be ninety (90) days after the Contractor
                  receives written notice of the reduction in payment, unless
                  available funds are insufficient to continue payments in full
                  during the ninety (90) day period, in which case LDSS shall
                  give the Contractor written notice of the earlier date upon
                  which the Agreement shall terminate. A reduction in State
                  and/or Federal funding cannot reduce monies due and owing to
                  the Contractor on or before the effective date of the
                  termination of the Agreement.

      2.8   Close-Out Procedures

            Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement and in the event
            that it is not scheduled for renewal, the Contractor shall comply
            with close-out procedures that the Contractor develops in
            conjunction with LDSS and that the LDSS, and the SDOH have approved.
            The close-out procedures shall include the following:

            a)    The Contractor shall promptly account for and repay funds
                  advanced by SDOH for coverage of Enrollees for periods
                  subsequent to the effective date of termination;

            b)    The Contractor shall give LDSS, SDOH, and other authorized
                  federal, state or local agencies access to all books, records,
                  and other documents and upon request, portions of such books,
                  records, or documents that may be required by such agencies
                  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;

            c)    The Contractor shall submit to LDSS, SDOH, and other
                  authorized federal, state or local agencies, within ninety
                  (90) days of termination, a final financial statement and
                  audit report relating to this Agreement, made by a certified
                  public accountant or a licensed public accountant, unless the
                  Contractor requests of LDSS and receives written approval
                  from LDSS, SDOH and all other governmental agencies from which
                  approval is required, for an extension of time for this
                  submission;

            d)    The Contractor shall furnish to SDOH immediately upon receipt
                  all information related to any request for reimbursement of
                  any medical claims that result from service delivered after
                  the date of termination of this Agreement;

            e)    The Contractor shall establish an appropriate plan acceptable
                  to and prior approved by the LDSS and SDOH for the orderly
                  disenrollment of Enrollees to the Medicaid fee-for-service
                  program or enrollment into another MCO. This plan shall
                  include the provision of pertinent information to identified
                  Enrollees who are: pregnant; currently receiving treatment for
                  a chronic or life threatening condition; prior approved for
                  services or surgery; or whose care is being monitored by a
                  case manager to assist them in making decisions which will
                  promote continuity of care.

            f)    SDOH shall promptly pay all claims and amounts owed to the
                  Contractor;

            g)    Any termination of this Agreement by either the Contractor or
                  LDSS shall be done by amendment to this Agreement, unless the
                  contract is terminated by the LDSS due to conditions in
                  Section 2.7 a.(i) or Appendix A of this Agreement.

      2.9   Rights and Remedies

            The rights and remedies of LDSS and the Contractor provided
            expressly in this Article shall not be exclusive and are in

            this Agreement.

3.    COMPENSATION

      3.1   Capitation Payments

            Compensation to the Contractor shall consist of a monthly capitation
            payment for each Enrollee and the Supplemental Capitation Payments
            as described in Sections 3.1 (c) and 3.1 (d), where applicable.

            a)    In no event shall monthly capitation payments to the
                  Contractor for the Benefit Package exceed the cost of
                  providing the Benefit Package on a fee-for-service basis to an
                  actuarially equivalent, non-enrolled population group Upper
                  Payment Limit (UPL) as determined by SDOH.

            b)    The monthly Capitation Rates are attached hereto as Appendix L
                  and shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without
                  further action by the parties.

            c)    The monthly capitation payments and the Supplemental Newborn
                  Capitation Payment and the Supplemental Maternity Capitation
                  Payment to the Contractor shall constitute full and complete
                  payments to the Contractor for all services that the
                  Contractor provides pursuant to this Agreement subject to
                  stop-loss provisions set forth in Section 3.11 and 3.12 of
                  this Agreement.

            d)    Capitation Rates shall be effective for the entire contract
                  period, except as described in Section 3.2.

      3.2   Modification of Rates During Contract Period

            a)    Any technical modification to Capitation Rates during the term
                  of the Agreement as agreed to by the Contractor, including but
                  not limited to, changes in reinsurance or the Benefit Package,
                  shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without
                  further action by the parties, upon approval by SDOH, and upon
                  written notice by SDOH to the LDSS.

            b)    Any other modification to Capitation Rates, as agreed to by
                  SDOH and the Contractor, during the term of the Agreement
                  shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without
                  further action by the parties upon approval of such
                  modifications by the SDOH and the State Division of the
                  Budget, and upon written notice by SDOH to the LDSS.

            c)    In the event that SDOH and the Contractor fail to reach
                  agreement on modifications to the monthly Capitation Rates,
                  the SDOH will provide formal written notice to the Contractor
                  and LDSS of the amount and effective date of the modified
                  Capitation Rates approved by the State Division of the Budget.
                  The Contractor shall have the option of terminating this
                  Agreement if such

                                    SECTION 3
                                 (COMPENSATION)

<PAGE>

                  approved modified Capitation Rates are not acceptable. In such
                  case, the Contractor shall give written notice to the SDOH and
                  the LDSS within thirty (30) days of the date of the formal
                  written notice of the modified Capitation Rates from SDOH
                  specifying the reasons for and effective date of termination.
                  The effective date of termination shall be ninety (90) days
                  from the date of the Contractor's written notice, unless the
                  SDOH determines that an orderly disenrollment to Medicaid fee-
                  for-service or transfer to another MCO can be accomplished
                  in fewer days. During the period commencing with the effective
                  date of the SDOH modified Capitation Rates through the
                  effective date of termination of the Agreement, the Contractor
                  shall have the option of continuing to receive capitation
                  payments at the expired Capitation Rates or at the modified
                  Capitation Rates approved by SDOH and State Division of the
                  Budget for the rate period.

                  If the Contractor fails to exercise its right to terminate in
                  accordance with this Section, then the modified Capitation
                  Rates approved by SDOH and the State Division of the Budget
                  shall be deemed incorporated into this Agreement without
                  further action by the parties as of the effective date of the
                  modified Capitation Rates as established by SDOH and approved
                  by State Division of the Budget.

      3.3   Rate Setting Methodology

            Capitation Rates are determined using a prospective methodology
            whereby cost, utilization and other rate-setting data available for
            the time period prior to the time period covered by the rates are
            used to establish premiums. Capitation rates will not be
            retroactively adjusted to reflect actual fee-for-service data or
            plan experience for the time period covered by the rates.

      3.4   Payment of Capitation

            a)    The monthly capitation payments for each Enrollee are due to
                  the Contractor from the Effective Date of Enrollment until the
                  Effective Date of Disenrollment of the Enrollee or termination
                  of this Agreement, whichever occurs first. The Contractor
                  shall receive a full month's capitation payment for the month
                  in which disenrollment occurs. The Roster generated by SDOH
                  with any modification communicated electronically or in
                  writing by the LDSS or the Enrollment Broker prior to the end
                  of the month in which the Roster is generated, shall be the
                  enrollment list for purposes of MMIS premium billing and
                  payment, as discussed in Section 6.9 and Appendix H.

            b)    Upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of a properly completed claim
                  for monthly capitation payments submitted by the Contractor
                  pursuant to this Agreement, the Fiscal Agent will promptly
                  process such claim for payment through MMIS and use its best
                  efforts to complete such processing within thirty (30)
                  business days from date of receipt of the claim by the Fiscal
                  Agent. Processing of

<PAGE>

                  Contractor claims shall be in compliance with the requirements
                  of 42 CFR 447.45. The Fiscal Agent will also use its best
                  efforts to resolve any billing problem relating to the
                  Contractor's claims as soon as possible. In accordance with
                  Section 41 of the State Finance Law, the State and LDSS shall
                  have no liability under this Agreement to the Contractor or
                  anyone else beyond funds appropriated and available for
                  payment of Medical Assistance care, services and supplies.

      3.5   Denial of Capitation Payments

            If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denies payment for
            new Enrollees, as authorized by Social Security Act (SSA) Section
            1903(m)(5) and 42 CFR Section 434.67, or such other applicable
            federal statutes or regulations, based upon a determination that
            Contractor failed substantially to provide medically necessary items
            and services, imposed premium amounts or charges in excess of
            permitted payments, engaged in discriminatory practices as described
            in SSA Section 1932(e)(l)(A)(iii), misrepresented or falsified
            information submitted to CMS, SDOH, LDSS, the Enrollment Broker, or
            an Enrollee, potential Enrollee, or health care provider, or failed
            to comply with federal requirements (i.e. 42 CFR Section 417.479 and
            42 CFR Section 434.70) relating to the Physician Incentive Plans,
            SDOH and LDSS will deny capitation payments to the Contractor for
            the same Enrollees for the period of time for which CMS denies such
            payment.

      3.6   SDOH Right to Recover Premiums

            The parties acknowledge and accept that the SDOH has a right to
            recover premiums paid to the Contractor for Enrollees listed on the
            monthly Roster who are later determined for the entire applicable
            payment month, to have been in an institution; to have been
            incarcerated; to have moved out of the Contractor's service area
            subject to any time remaining in the Enrollee's Guaranteed
            Eligibility period; or to have died. In any event, the State may
            only recover premiums paid for Medicaid Enrollees listed on a Roster
            if it is determined by the SDOH that the Contractor was not at risk
            for provision of Benefit Package services for any portion of the
            payment period.

      3.7   Third Party Health Insurance Determination

            The Contractor and the LDSS will make diligent efforts to determine
            whether Enrollees have third party health insurance (TPHI). The LDSS
            shall use its best efforts to maintain third party information on
            the WMS/MMIS Third Party Resource System. The Contractor shall make
            good faith efforts to coordinate benefits with and collect TPHI
            recoveries from other insurers, and must inform the LDSS of any
            known changes in status of TPHI insurance eligibility within thirty
            (30) days of learning of a change in TPHI. The Contractor may use
            the Roster as one method to determine TPHI information. The
            Contractor will be permitted to retain 100 percent of any
            reimbursement for Benefit Package services obtained

            from TPHI. Capitation Rates are net of TPHI recoveries. In no
            instances may an Enrollee be held responsible for disputes over
            these recoveries.

      3.8   Payment For Newborns

            a)    The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and services
                  included in the Benefit Package associated with the Enrollee's
                  newborn, unless the child is excluded from Medicaid Managed
                  Care.

            b)    The Contractor shall receive a capitation payment from the
                  first day of the newborn's month of birth and, in instances
                  where the plan pays the hospital or birthing center for the
                  newborn stay, a Supplemental Newborn Capitation Payment.

            c)    Capitation Rate and Supplemental Newborn Capitation Payment
                  for a newborn will begin the month following certification of
                  the newborn's eligibility and enrollment, retroactive to the
                  first day of the month in which the child was born.

            d)    The Contractor cannot bill for a Supplemental Newborn
                  Capitation Payment unless the newborn hospital or birthing
                  center payment has been paid by the Contractor. The Contractor
                  must maintain on file evidence of payment to the hospital or
                  birthing center of the claim for the newborn stay. Failure to
                  have supporting records may, upon an audit, result in
                  recoupment of the Supplemental Newborn Capitation Payment by
                  SDOH.

      3.9   Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment

            a)    The Contractor shall be responsible for all costs and services
                  included in the Benefit Package associated with the maternity
                  care of an Enrollee.

            b)    In instances where the Enrollee is enrolled in the
                  Contractor's plan on the date of the delivery of a child, the
                  Contractor shall be entitled to receive a Supplemental
                  Maternity Capitation Payment. The Supplemental Maternity
                  Capitation Payment reimburses the Contractor for the inpatient
                  and outpatient costs of services normally provided as part of
                  maternity care including antepartum care, delivery and
                  post-partum care. The Supplemental Maternity Capitation
                  Payment is in addition to the monthly Capitation Rate paid by
                  the SDOH to the Contractor for the Enrollee.

            c)    In instances where the Enrollee was enrolled in the
                  Contractor's plan for only part of the pregnancy, but was
                  enrolled on the date of the delivery of the child, the plan
                  shall be entitled to receive the entire Supplemental Maternity
                  Capitation Payment. The Supplemental Capitation payment shall
                  not be pro-rated to reflect that the Enrollee was not a member
                  of the Contractor's plan for the entire duration of the
                  pregnancy.

            d)    In instances where the Enrollee was enrolled in the
                  Contractor's plan for part of the pregnancy, but was not
                  enrolled on the date of the delivery of the child, the
                  Contractor shall not be entitled to receive the Supplemental
                  Maternity Capitation Payment, or any portion thereof.

            e)    Costs of inpatient and outpatient care associated with
                  maternity cases that end in termination or miscarriage shall
                  be reimbursed to the Contractor through the monthly Capitation
                  Rate for the Enrollee and the Contractor shall not receive the
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment.

            f)    The Contractor may not bill a Supplemental Maternity
                  Capitation Payment until the hospital inpatient or birthing
                  center delivery is paid by the Contractor, and the Contractor
                  must maintain on file evidence of payment of the delivery,
                  plus any other inpatient and outpatient services for the
                  maternity care of the Enrollee to be eligible to receive a
                  Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment. Failure to have
                  supporting records may, upon audit, result in recoupment of
                  the Supplemental Maternity Capitation Payment by the SDOH.

      3.10  Contractor Financial Liability

            Contractor shall not be financially liable for any services rendered
            to an Enrollee prior to his or her Effective Date of Enrollment in
            the Contractor's plan.

      3.11  Inpatient Hospital Stop-Loss Insurance

            The Contractor must obtain stop-loss coverage for inpatient
            hospital services. A Contractor may elect to purchase stop-loss
            coverage from New York State. In such cases, the Capitation Rates
            paid to the Contractor shall be adjusted to reflect the cost of such
            stop-loss coverage. The cost of such coverage shall be determined by
            SDOH.

            Under NYS stop-loss coverage, if the hospital inpatient expenses
            incurred by the Contractor for an individual Enrollee during any
            calendar year reaches $50,000, the Contractor shall be compensated
            for 80% of the cost of hospital inpatient services in excess of this
            amount up to a maximum of $250,000. Above that amount, the
            Contractor will be compensated for 100% of cost. All compensation
            shall be based on the lower of the Contractor's negotiated hospital
            rate or Medicaid rates of payment.

            [ ]   The Contractor has elected to have NYS provide stop-loss
                  reinsurance.

      3.12  Mental Health and Chemical Dependence Stop-Loss

            a)    The Contractor will be compensated for medically necessary and
                  clinically appropriate Medicaid reimbursable mental health
                  treatment outpatient visits in excess of twenty (20) visits
                  during any calendar year at rates set forth in contracted fee
                  schedules. Any Court Ordered Services for mental health
                  treatment outpatient visits which specify the use of Non-
                  Participating Providers shall be compensated at the Medicaid
                  rate of payment.

            b)    The Contractor will be compensated for medically necessary and
                  clinically appropriate inpatient mental health services and/or
                  Chemical Dependence Inpatient Rehabilitation and Treatment
                  Services as defined in Appendix K in excess of a combined
                  total of thirty (30) days during a calendar year at the lower
                  of the Contractor's negotiated inpatient rate or Medicaid rate
                  of payment.

            c)    Detoxification Services in Article 28 inpatient hospital
                  facilities are subject to the stop-loss provisions specified
                  in Section 3.11 of this Agreement.

      3.13  Enrollment Limitations

            a)    The Contractor may enroll up to the county specific provider
                  network capacity limits determined by SDOH, provided that the
                  Contractor's statewide enrollment does not exceed the MCO's
                  financial capacity as determined annually by SDOH, or more
                  frequently as deemed necessary by SDOH.

            b)    LDSS shall have the right, upon consultation with and notice
                  to the SDOH, to limit, suspend, or terminate enrollment
                  activities by the Contractor and/or enrollment into the
                  Contractor's plan upon ten (10) days written notice to the
                  Contractor. The written notice shall specify the actions
                  contemplated and the reason(s) for such action(s) and shall
                  provide the Contractor with an opportunity to submit
                  additional information that would support the conclusion on
                  that limitation, suspension or termination of enrollment
                  activities or enrollment in the Contractor's plan is
                  unnecessary. Nothing in this paragraph limits other remedies
                  available to the LDSS under this Agreement.

            c)    The SDOH shall have the right, upon notice to the LDSS, to
                  limit, suspend or terminate enrollment activities by the
                  Contractor and/or enrollment into the Contractor's plan upon
                  ten (10) days written notice to the Contractor. The written
                  notice shall specify the action(s) contemplated and the

                  reason(s) for such action(s) and shall provide the Contractor
                  with an opportunity to submit additional information that
                  would support the conclusion that limitation, suspension or
                  termination of enrollment activities or enrollment in the
                  Contractor's plan is unnecessary. Nothing in this paragraph
                  limits other remedies available to the SDOH or the LDSS under
                  this Agreement.

      3.14  Tracking Visits Provided by Indian Health Clinics

            The SDOH shall monitor all visits provided by tribal or Indian
            health clinics or urban Indian health facilities or centers to

            made for those services, should it be deemed necessary to do so.

      5.2   Exempt Populations

            The following populations are exempt from mandatory enrollment in
            Medicaid managed care, but may enroll on a voluntary basis, if
            otherwise eligible.

            a)    Individuals who are HIV+ or have AIDS.

            b)    Individuals who are Seriously and Persistently Mentally Ill
                  or Seriously Emotionally Disturbed.

            c)    Individuals for whom a Managed Care Provider is not
                  geographically accessible so as to reasonably provide
                  services. To qualify for this exemption, an individual must
                  demonstrate that no participating MCO has a provider located
                  within thirty (30) minutes travel time/thirty (30) miles
                  travel distance from the individual's home, who is accepting
                  new patients, and that there is a fee-for-service Medicaid
                  provider available within the thirty (30) minutes travel
                  time/thirty (30) miles travel distance.

                  a woman's pregnancy, extend through the sixty (60) day
                  post-partum period and end at the end of the month in which
                  the sixtieth (60th) day occurs.

            e)    Individuals with a chronic medical condition who, for at least

                  network provider for any MCO participating in the Medicaid
                  managed care program service area. This status will last as
                  long as the individual's chronic medical condition exists or
                  until the physician joins a participating MCO's network. The
                  SDOH's Office of Managed Care, Medical Director will, upon the

                  authorized representative (health care agent authorized
                  through a health care proxy), review cases of individuals with
                  unusually severe chronic care needs for a possible exemption

                  care is mandatory, the LDSS must inform Enrollees who have
                  Family members enrolled in other MCOs hat if anyone in the
                  Family wishes to change plans, all members of the Family must
                  enroll together in the newly-selected plan. The LDSS shall
                  also notify the Enrollee that all members of the Family will
                  be required to enroll together in a single MCO at the time of
                  their next recertification for Medicaid eligibility unless
                  waiver of this requirement is approved by the LDSS.

            c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing,

                  i)    the LDSS may, on a case-by-case basis, waive the same
                        family rule specified in Sections 6.6 (a) and (b) to
                        preserve continuity of care:

                        1)    if one or more members of the Family are receiving
                              prenatal care and/or continuing care for a complex
                              chronic medical condition from Non-Participating
                              Providers; or

                        2)    if one or more members of the Family transition
                              from one government-sponsored insurance program to
                              another.

                  ii)   the LDSS must allow HIV SNP-eligible individuals within
                        a family to enroll in an HIV SNP, in Service Areas in
                        which an HIV SNP exists.

      6.7   Newborn Enrollment

            a)    All newborn children not in an excluded category shall be
                  enrolled in the MCO of the mother, effective from the first
                  day of the child's month of birth.

            b)    In addition to the responsibilities set forth in Appendix H,
                  the Contractor is responsible for doing all of the following
                  with respect to newborns:

                  i)    Coordinating with the LDSS the efforts to ensure that

                        appointment with the PCP immediately upon birth; and

                  iv)   Ensuring that the newborn is linked with a PCP prior to
                        discharge from the hospital, in those instances in which
                        the Contractor has received appropriate notification of:
                        the birth prior to discharge.

            c)    The LDSS shall be responsible for ensuring that timely
                  Medicaid Eligibility determination and enrollment of the
                  newborns is effected consistent with state laws, regulations,

            a)    The Contractor and the LDSS must notify the Enrollee of the
                  expected Effective Date of Enrollment. This may be
                  accomplished through a "Welcome Letter". To the extent
                  practicable, such notification must precede the Effective Date
                  of Enrollment. In the event that the actual Effective Date of
                  Enrollment changes, the Contractor and the LDSS must notify
                  the Enrollee of the change.

            b)    As of the Effective Date of Enrollment, and until the

                  the Contractor shall be responsible for the provision and cost
                  of all care and services covered by the Benefit Package and
                  provided to Enrollees whose names appear on the Prepaid

                  i)    Contractor shall not be liable for the cost of any
                        services rendered to an Enrollee prior to his or her
                        Effective Date of Enrollment.

                  ii)   Contractor shall not be liable for any part of the cost
                        of a hospital stay for an Enrollee who is admitted to

                        payment rules, the method of payment changes from: a)
                        DRG

                        case-based rate of payment per discharge to a per diem
                        rate of payment exempt from DRG case-based payment
                        rates, or b) from a per diem payment rate exempt from
                        DRG case-based payment rates either to another per diem
                        rate, or a DRG case-based payment rate. In such
                        instances, the Contractor shall be liable for the cost
                        of the consecutive stay.

            a)    The first and second monthly Rosters generated by SDOH in

                  to ongoing eligibility of the Enrollees as of the first (1st)
                  day of the enrollment month. Modifications to the first (lst)
                  Roster may be made electronically or in writing by the LDSS or
                  the Enrollment Broker prior to the end of the month in which
                  the Roster is generated.

            b)    The LDSS shall make data on eligibility determinations
                  available to the Contractor and SDOH to resolve discrepancies
                  that may arise between the Roster and the Contractor's
                  enrollment files in accordance with the provisions in Appendix
                  H, Section D.

                  and provides supporting information as necessary prior to the
                  effective date of the Roster, the Contractor will accept that
                  notification in the same manner as the Roster.

            d)    All Contractors must have the ability to receive these Rosters
                  electronically.

      6.10  Automatic Re-Enrollment

            The Contractor agrees that Eligible Persons who are disenrolled from
            the Contractor's plan due to loss of Medicaid eligibility and who
            regain eligibility within three (3) months will automatically be
            prospectively re-enrolled with the Contractor's plan, subject to
            availibility of enrollment capacity in the plan.

            following reasons:

            a)    an existing condition or change in the Enrollee's health which
                  would necessitate disenrollment pursuant to the terms of this
                  Agreement, unless the change

                  i)    results in the Enrollee being reclassified into an
                        excluded category for Medicaid managed care as listed in
                        Section 5.3 of this Agreement;

      8.3   Reasons for Voluntary Disenrollment

            The LDSS or the Contractor, as agreed upon between the LDSS and
            Contractor, shall provide Enrollees who disenroll voluntarily with
            an opportunity to identify, in writing, their reason(s) for
            disenrollment.

      8.4   Processing of Disenrollment Requests

            a)    Routine Disenrollment

                  Unless otherwise specified in Appendix H, Section F
                  disenrollment requests will be processed to take effect on
                  the first (1st) day of the next month if the request is made
                  before the date specified in Appendix H. In no event shall the
                  Effective Date of Disenrollment be later than the first (1st)
                  day of the second (2nd) month after the month in which an
                  Enrollee requests a disenrollment.

            b)    Expedited Disenrollment

                  i)    Enrollees with an urgent medical need to disenroll from
                        the Contractor's plan may request an expedited
                        disenrollment by the LDSS. Substantiation of the request
                        by the LDSS will result in an expedited disenrollment in
                        accordance with the guidelines and timeframes as set
                        forth in Appendix H. Individuals who are to be
                        disenrolled from managed care based on their HIV, ESRD
                        or SPMI/SED status are categorically eligible for an
                        expedited disenrollment on the basis of urgent medical
                        need.

                  ii)   Enrollees may request an expedited disenrollment by the
                        LDSS based on a complaint of Non-consensual Enrollment.
                        Substantiation of such a request by the LDSS shall
                        result in an expedited disenrollment retroactive to the
                        first day of the month of enrollment.

                  iii)  In New York City and other districts where homeless
                        individuals are exempt, homeless Enrollees residing in
                        the shelter system may request an expedited
                        disenrollment by the LDSS. Substantiation of such a
                        request by the LDSS will result in an expedited
                        disenrollment in accordance with the guidelines and
                        timeframes as set forth in Appendix H.

            c)    Retroactive Disenrollment

                  i)    Retroactive disenrollments may be warranted in rare
                        instances and include when an individual is enrolled or
                        autoassigned while meeting exclusion criteria or
                        when an Enrollee enters or stays in a residential
                        institution under circumstances which render the

                        individual excluded from managed care; is incarcerated;
                        is an SSI infant less than six months of age; or dies -
                        as long as the Contractor was not at risk for provision
                        of Benefit Package services for any portion of the
                        retroactive period.

      8.5   Contractor Notification of Disenrollments

            a)    Notwithstanding anything cretin to the contrary, the Roster,
                  along with any changes sent by the LDSS to the Contractor in
                  writing or electronically, shall serve as official notice to
                  the Contractor of disenrollment of an Enrollee. In cases of
                  expedited and retroactive disenrollment, the Contractor shall
                  be notified of the Enrollee's effective date of disenrollment
                  by the LDSS.

            b)    In the event that the LDSS intends to retroactively disenroll
                  an Enrollee on a date prior to the first day of the month of
                  the disenrollment request, the LDSS shall consult with the
                  Contractor prior to disenrollment. Such consultation shall not
                  be required for the retroactive disenrollment of SSI infants
                  or in cases where it is clear that the Contractor was not a
                  risk for the provision of Benefit Package services for any
                  portion of the retroactive period.

            c)    In all cases of retroactive disenrollment, including
                  disenrollments effective the first day of the current month,
                  the LDSS must notice the plan at the time of disenrollment, of
                  the Contractor's responsibility to submit to the SDOH's Fiscal
                  Agent voided premium claims for any months of retroactive
                  disenrollment where the Contract was not at risk for the
                  provision of Benefit Package services during that month.

      8.6   Contractor's Liability

            a)    The Contractor is not responsible for providing the Benefit
                  Package under this Agreement after the Effective Date of
                  Disenrollment except as hereinafter provided:

                  i)    The Contractor shall be liable for any part of the cost
                  of a hospital stay for an Enrollee who is admitted to the
                  hospital prior to the Effective Date of Disenrollment in the
                  Contrator's plan and who remains hospitalized on the Effective
                  Date of Disenrollment; except when the Enrollee, on or after
                  the Effective Date of Disenrollment, 1) is transferred from
                  one hospital to another; or 2) is discharged from one unit in
                  the hospital to another unit in the same facility and under
                  Medicaid fee for service payment rules, the method of payment
                  changes from: a) DRG case-based rate of payment per discharge
                  to a per diem rate of payment exempt from DRG case-based
                  payment rates, or b) from a per diem payment rate exempt from
                  DRG case-based payment rates to either another per diem rate,
                  or a DRG case-based

                                    SECTION 8
                                 (DISENROLLMENT)

                  payment rate. In such instances, the Contractor shall not be
                  liable for the cost of the consecutive stay. For the purposes
                  of this Section, "hospital stay" does not include a stay in a
                  hospital that is a) certified by Medicare as a long-term care
                  hospital and b) has an average length of stay for all patients
                  greater than ninety-five (95) days as reported in the
                  Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS)
                  Annual Report 2002; in such instances, Contractor liability
                  will cease on the Effective Date of Disenrollment.

            b)    The Contractor shall notify the LDSS that the Enrollee remains
                  in the hospital and provide the LDSS with information
                  regarding his or her medical status. The Contractor is
                  required to cooperate with the Enrollee and the new MCO (if
                  applicable) on a timely basis to ensure a smooth transition
                  and continuity of care.

      8.7   Enrollee Initiated Disenrollment

            a)    Disenrollment For Good Cause

                  i)    An Enrollee subject to Lock-In may initiate
                        disenrollment from the Contractor's plan for "good
                        cause" as defined in 18 NYCRR Section 360-10 at any time
                        during the Lock-In period and may disenroll for any
                        reason at any time after the twelfth (12th) month
                        following the Effective Date of Enrollment.

                  ii)   An Enrollee subject to Lock-In may initiate
                        disenrollment for "good cause" by filing a written
                        request with the LDSS or the Contractor. The Contractor
                        must notify the LDSS of the request. The LDSS must
                        respond with a determination within thirty (30) days
                        after receipt of the request. The Contractor must
                        respond timely to LDSS inquiries regarding "good cause"
                        disenrollment requests to enable the LDSS to make a
                        determination within 30 days of the receipt of the
                        request from the Enrollee.

                  iii)  Enrollees granted disenrollment for "good cause" in a
                        voluntary county may join another plan, if one is
                        available, or participate in Medicaid fee-for-service
                        program. In mandatory counties, unless the Enrollee
                        becomes exempt or excluded, he/she may be required to
                        enroll with another MCO.

                  iv)   In the event that the LDSS denies an Enrollee's request
                        for disenrollment for "good cause", the LDSS must inform
                        the Enrollee of the denial of the request with a written
                        notice which explains the reason for the denial, states
                        the facts upon which denial is based, cites the
                        statutory and regulatory authority and advises the
                        recipient of his or her right to a fair hearing pursuant
                        to 18 NYCRR Part 358. In the event that the Enrollee's
                        request to disenroll is approved, the notice must state
                        the Effective Date of Disenrollment.

                                    SECTION 8
                                 (DISENROLLMENT)

                  v)    Once the Lock-In Period has expired, an Enrollee may
                        disenroll from the Contractor's plan at any time, for
                        any reason.

      8.8   Contractor Initiated Disenrollment

            a)    The Contractor may initiate an involuntary disenrollment if
                  the Enrollee engages in conduct or behavior that seriously
                  impairs the Contractor's ability to furnish services to either
                  the Enrollee or other Enrollees, provided that the Contractor
                  has made and documented reasonable efforts to resolve the
                  problems presented by the Enrollee.

            b)    Consistent with 42 CFR 438.56 (b), the Contractor may not
                  request disenrollment because of an adverse change in the
                  Enrollee's health status, or because of the Enrollee's
                  utilization of medical services, diminished mental capacity,
                  or uncooperative or disruptive behavior resulting from the
                  Enrollee's special needs (except where continued enrollment in
                  the Contractor's plan seriously impairs the Contractor's
                  ability to furnish services to either the Enrollee or other
                  Enrollees).

            c)    The Contractor must make a reasonable effort to identify for
                  the Enrollee, both verbally and in writing, those actions of
                  the Enrollee that have interfered with the effective provision
                  of covered services as well as explain what actions or
                  procedures are acceptable.

            d)    The Contractor shall give prior verbal and written notice to
                  the Enrollee, with a copy to the LDSS, of its intent to
                  request disenrollment. The written notice shall advise the
                  Enrollee that the request has been forwarded to the LDSS for
                  review and approval. The written notice must include the
                  mailing address and telephone number of the LDSS.

            e)    The Contractor shall keep the LDSS informed of decisions
                  related to all complaints filed by an Enrollee as a result of,
                  or subsequent to, the notice of intent to disenroll.

            f)    The LDSS will review each Contractor initiated disenrollment
                  request in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
                  Where applicable, the LDSS may consult with local mental
                  health and substance abuse authorities in the district when
                  making the determination to approve or disapprove a Contractor
                  initiated disenrollment request.

            g)    The LDSS will render a decision within fifteen (15) days of
                  receipt of the fully documented request or disenrollment.
                  Final written determination will be provided to the Enrollee
                  and the Contractor. If the LDSS determination upholds the
                  Contractor's request to disenroll, the LDSS's written
                  determination must inform the Enrollee of the Effective Date
                  of Disenrollment and include a notice of rights to a fair
                  hearing. Should an

<PAGE>

                  Enrollee request a fair hearing as a result of the LDSS
                  determination, the LDSS shall inform the Contractor of the
                  fair hearing request and the Enrollee will remain enrolled in
                  the Contractor's plan until disposition of the fair hearing.

            h)    Once an Enrollee has been disenrolled at the Contractor's
                  request, he/she will not be re-enrolled with the Contractor's
                  plan unless the Contractor first agrees to such re-enrollment.

      8.9   LDSS Initiated Disenrollment

            a)    LDSS will promptly initiate disenrollment when:

                  i)    an Enrollee is no longer eligible for any Medicaid
                        benefits; or

                  ii)   the Guaranteed Eligibility period ends (See Section 9)
                        and an Enrollee is no longer eligible for any Medicaid
                        benefits; or

                  iii)  an Enrollee is no longer the financial responsibility of
                        the LDSS; or

                  iv)   an Enrollee becomes ineligible for enrollment pursuant
                        to Section 5.3 of this Agreement, as appropriate; or

                  v)    an Enrollee resides outside the Service Area covered by
                        this Agreement, unless Contractor can demonstrate that
                        the Enrollee has made an informed choice to continue
                        enrollment with Contractor and that Enrollee will have
                        sufficient access to Contractor's provider network.

9.    GUARANTEED ELIGIBILITY

      Except as may otherwise be required by law:

      9.1   New Enrollees, other than those identified in Sections 9.2 who would
            otherwise lose Medicaid eligibility during the first six (6) months
            of enrollment will retain the right to remain enrolled in the
            Contractor's plan under this Agreement for a period of six (6)
            months from their Effective Date of Enrollment

      9.2   Guaranteed eligibility is not available to Enrollees who lose
            Medicaid eligibility for one of the following reasons:

            a)    death, moving out of State, or incarceration;

            b)    being a woman with a net available income in excess of
                  medically necessary income but at or below 200% of the federal
                  poverty level who is only eligible for Medicaid while she is
                  pregnant and then through the end of the month in which the
                  sixtieth (60th) day following the end of the pregnancy occurs.

      9.3   If, during the first six (6) months of enrollment in the
            Contractor's plan, an Enrollee becomes eligible for Medicaid only as
            a spend-down, the Enrollee will be eligible to remain enrolled in
            the (contractor's plan for the remainder of the six (6) month
            guarantee period. During the six (6) month guarantee period, an
            Enrollee eligible for spend-down and in need of wraparound services
            has the option of spending down to gain full Medicaid eligibility
            for the wraparound services. In this situation, the LDSS will
            monitor the Enrollee's need for wrap around services and manually
            set coverage codes as appropriate.

      9.4   The services covered during the Guaranteed Eligibility period shall
            be those contained in the Benefit Package as specified in Appendix
            K, including free access to family planning services as set forth in
            Section 10.12 of this Agreement. During the Guaranteed Eligibility
            period Enrollees are also eligible for pharmacy services on a
            Medicaid fee-for-service basis.

      9.5   An Enrollee-initiated disenrollment from the Contractor's plan
            terminates the Guaranteed Eligibility period.

      9.6   Enrollees who lose and regain Medicaid eligibility within a three
            (3) month period will not be entitled to a new period of six (6)
            months Guaranteed Eligibility.

      9.7   During the guarantee period, an Enrollee may not change health
            plans. An Enrollee may choose to disenroll from the Contractor's
            Plan during the guarantee period but is not eligible to enroll in
            any other MCO because he/she has lost eligibility for Medicaid.

                        prevent the worsening of, alleviate or ameliorate the
                        effects of an illness, injury, disability, disorder or
                        condition.

                  ii)   The care or services are essential to the overall
                        physical, cognitive and mental growth and developmental

      The Contractor will coordinate its public health-related activities with
      the Local Public Health Agency. Coordination mechanisms and operational
      protocols for addressing public health issues will be negotiated with the

10.19 Public Health Services

     a)   Tuberculosis Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment; Directly Observed
          Therapy(TB\DOT):

          i)   Consistent with New York State law, public health clinics are
               required to provide or arrange for treatment to individuals
               presenting with tuberculosis, regardless of the person's
               insurance or enrollment status. It is the State's preference that
               the Contractor's Enrollees receive TB diagnosis and treatment
               through the Contractor's plan, to the extent that providers
               experienced in this type of care are available in the
               Contractor's network of Participating Providers, although
               Enrollees may self-refer to public health agency facilities for
               the diagnosis and/or treatment of TB. The Contractor agrees to
               reimburse public health clinics when physician visit and patient
               management or laboratory and radiology services are rendered to
               their Enrollees, within the context of TB diagnosis and
               treatment.

          ii)  The Contractor's Participating Providers must report TB cases to
               the Local Public Health Agency. The LDSS will have the Local
               Public Health Agency review the tuberculosis treatment protocols
               and networks of Participating Provider of the Contractor, to
               verify their readiness to treat Tuberculosis patients. The
               Contractor's protocols will be evaluated against State and local
               guidelines. State and local departments of health also will be
               available to offer technical assistance to the Contractor in
               establishing TB policies and procedures.

          iii) The Contractor may require the Local Public Health Agency to give
               notification before delivering services, unless these services
               are ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Local
               Public Health Agency will: 1) make reasonable efforts to verify
               with the Enrollee's PCP that he/she has not already provided TB
               care and treatment, and 2) provide documentation of services
               rendered along with the claim.

                                   SECTION 10
               (BENEFIT PACKAGE, COVERED AND NON-COVERED SERVICES)
                                 October 1, 2004
                                      10-10

<PAGE>
         iv)   The Contractor may use locally negotiated fees. In addition, SDOH
               will establish fee schedules for these services, which the
               Contractor may use in the absence of locally negotiated fees.

         v)    Contractors may require; prior authorization for non-emergency
               inpatient hospital admissions, except that prior authorization
               will not be required for an admission pursuant to a court order
               or an order of detention issued by the local commissioner or
               director of public health.

         vi)   The Contractor shall provide the Local Public Health Agency with
               access to health care practitioners on a twenty-four (24) hour a
               day, seven (7) day a week basis who can authorize inpatient
               hospital admissions. The Contractor shall responsed to the Local
               Public Health Agency's request for authorization within the same
               day.

         vii)  The Contractor will not be capitated or financially liable for
               Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) costs. The Contractor agrees to
               make all reasonable efforts to ensure coordination with DOT
               providers regarding clinical care and services. HIV counseling
               and testing during a TB related visit at a public health clinic,
               directly operated by a county health department or the New York
               City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, will be covered by
               Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) at rates established by the State.
               The Contractor also will not be financially liable for treatments
               rendered to Enrollees who have been institutionalized as a result
               of a local health commissioner's order due to non-compliance with
               TB care regimens.

         viii) While all other clinical management of tuberculosis is covered by
               the Contractor, TB/DOT where applicable, can be billed directly
               to Medicaid by any SDOH approved fee-for-service Medicaid TB/DOT
               provider. The Contractor remains responsible for communicating,
               cooperating, and coordinating clinical management of TB with the
               TB/DOT provider. The Enrollee reserves the right to use any
               fee-for-service DOT provider because TB/DOT is a non-covered
               benefit.

     b)  Immunizations

         i)    Immunizations for adults and administration of immunizations for
               children will be included in the Benefit Package and the
               Contractor will be required to reimburse the Local Public Health
               Agency when Enrollees self-refer.

         ii)   In order to be eligible for reimbursement, a Local Public Health
               Agency must make reasonable efforts to (1) determine the
               Enrollee's managed care membership status; and (2) ascertain the
               Enrollee's immunization status. Such efforts shall consist of
               client interviews and, when available, access to the Immunization
               Registry. When an Enrollee presents a membership card with a
               PCP's name, the Local Public Health Agency shall call the PCP. If
               the agency is unable to verify the immunization status from the
               PCP or learns that immunization is needed, the agency shall
               proceed to deliver the service as appropriate, and the Contractor
               will reimburse the Local Public Health Agency at the negotiated
               rate or at a fee schedule to

                                   SECTION 10
               (BENEFIT PACKAGE, COVERED AND NON-COVERED SERVICES)

               be used in the absence of a negotiated rate. Upon implementation
               of the immunization registry, the Local Public Health Agency
               shall not be required to contact the PCP.

          iii) If the immunization is administered by the PCP, immunization
               materials for children should be obtained free of charge from the
               "Vaccine For Children Program". The Contractor will be reimbursed
               only for administering the vaccine to children.

     c)   Prevention and Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Diseases

          The Contractor will be responsible for ensuring that its
          Participating Providers educate their Enrollees about the risk and
          prevention of sexually transmitted disease (STD). The Contractor also
          will be responsible for ensuring that its Participating Providers
          screen and treat Enrollees for STDs and report cases of STD to the
          Local Public Health Agency and cooperate in contact investigation, in
          accordance with existing state and local laws and regulations. HIV
          counseling and testing provided during a STD related visit at a
          public health clinic, directly operated by a county health department
          or the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, will be
          covered by Medicaid FFS at rates established by the State.

     d)   Lead Poisoning

          The Contractor will be responsible for carrying out and ensuring that
          its Participating Providers comply with lead poisoning screening and
          follow-up as specified in 10 NYCRR, Sub-part 67.1. The Contractor
          shall coordinate the care of such children with Local Public Health
          Agencies to assure appropriate follow-up in terms of environmental
          investigation, risk management and reporting requirements.

          i.e., behavior counseling for HIV negative Enrollees with risk
          behavior. Primary prevention also includes strategies to help prevent
          infected Enrollees from transmitting HIV infection, i.e., behavior
          counseling with an HIV infected Enrollee to reduce risky sexual
          behavior or providing antiviral therapy to a pregnant, HIV infected
          female to prevent transmission of HIV infection to a newborn. HIV
          Secondary Prevention means promotion of early detection and treatment
          of HIV disease in an asymptomatic Enrollee to prevent the development
          of symptomatic disease. This includes: regular medical assessments;

          opportunistic infections; regular dental, optical, dermatological and
          gynecological care; optimal diet/nutritional supplementation; and
          partner notification services which lead to the early detection and
          treatment of other infected persons. All plan Enrollees should be
          informed of the availability of HIV counseling, testing, referral and
          partner notification (CTRPN) services.

     b)   Policies and procedures promoting the early identification of HIV
          infection in Enrollees. Such policies and procedures shall include at
          a minimum: assessment methods for recognizing the early signs and
          symptoms of HIV disease; initial and routine screening for HIV risk
          factors through administration of sexual behavior and drug and alcohol
          use assessments; and the provision of information to all Enrollees
          regarding the availability of in-plan HIV CTRPN services, out of plan
          CTRPN services as part of a family planning visit, and anonymous CTRPN
          services from New York State, New York City and Local Public Health
          Agencies.

     c)   The Contractor shall comply with the requirements set forth in Title
          10 NYCRR (including Part 98 and in Subpart 69-1) which mandate that
          HIV counseling with testing, presented as a clinical recommendation,
          be provided to all women in prenatal care and their newborns.
          Consistent with these requirements, the Contractor shall ensure that
          Participating Providers refer such Enrollees determined to have HIV
          infection for clinically appropriate services.

                    Enrollees may use to access information on obtaining
                    services when his/her PCP is not available; and

               v)   for ID Cards issued after October 1, 2004, the Enrollee's
                    Client Identification Number (CIN).

          b)   If an Enrollee is being served by a PCP team, the name of the
               individual shown on the card should be the lead provider. PCP

                                      13-1

<PAGE>
          c)   The Contractor shall issue an identification card within fourteen
               (14) days of an Enrollee's Effective Date of Enrollment. If
               unforeseen circumstances, such as the lack of identification of a
               PCP, prevent the MCO from forwarding the official identification
               card to new Enrollees within the fourteen (14) day period,
               alternative measures by which Enrollees may identify themselves
               such as use of a Welcome Letter or a temporary identification
               card shall be deemed acceptable until such time as a PCP is
               either chosen by the Enrollee or auto assigned by the Contractor.
               The Contractor agrees to implement an alternative method by which
               individuals may identify themselves as Enrollees prior to
               receiving the card (e.g., using a "welcome letter" from the plan)
               and to update PCP information on the identification card.
               Newborns of Enrollees need not present ID cards in order to be
               seen by the MCO and its Participating Providers.

     13.3 Member Handbooks

          The Contractor shall issue to a new Enrollee within fourteen (14)
          days of the Effective Date of Enrollment a Member Handbook, which is
          consistent with the SDOH guidelines described in Appendix E, which is
          hereby made a part of this Agreement as if set forth fully herein.

     13.4 Notification of Effective Date of Enrollment

          The Contractor shall inform each Enrollee in writing within fourteen
          (14) days of the Effective Date of Enrollment of any restriction on
          the Enrollee's right to terminate enrollment. The initial enrollment
          information and the Member Handbook shall be adequate to convey this
          notice.

     13.5 Notification of Enrollee Rights

          The Contractor agrees to make all reasonable efforts to contact new
          Enrollees, in person, by telephone, or by mail, within thirty (30)
          days of their Effective Date of Enrollment "Reasonable efforts" are
          defined to mean at least three (3) attempts, with more than one method
          of contact being employed. Upon contacting the new Enrollee(s), the
          Contractor agrees to do at least the following:

          a)   Inform the Enrollee about the Contractor's policies with respect
               to obtaining medical services, including services for which the
               Enrollee may self-refer, and what to do in an emergency.

          b)   Conduct a brief health screening to assess the Enrollee's need
               for any special health care (e.g., prenatal or behavioral health
               services) or language/communication needs. If a special need is
               identified, the Contractor shall assist the Enrollee in arranging
               for an appointment with his/her PCP or other appropriate
               provider.

                                   SECTION 13

                                      13-2

<PAGE>

          c)   Offer assistance in arranging an initial visit to the Enrollee's
               PCP for a baseline physical and other preventive services,
               including an assessment of the Enrollee's potential risk, if any,
               for specific diseases or conditions.

          d)   Inform new Enrollees about their rights for continuation of
               certain existing services.

          e)   Provide the Enrollee with the Contractor's toll free telephone
               number that may be called twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7)
               days a week if the Enrollee has questions about obtaining
               services and cannot reach his/her PCP (this telephone number need
               not be the Member Services line and need not be staffed to
               respond to Member Services-related inquiries). The Contractor
               must have appropriate mechanisms in place to accommodate
               Enrollees who do not have telephones and therefore cannot readily
               receive a call back.

          f)   Advise Enrollee about opportunities available to learn about MCO
               policies and benefits in greater detail e.g., welcome meeting,
               Enrollee orientation and education sessions).

          g)   Provide the Enrollee with a complete list of network providers
               that may be accessed directly, without referral. The list should
               group providers by service type and must include addresses and
               telephone numbers.

          h)   Assist the Enrollee in selecting a primary care provider if one
               has not already been chosen.

     13.6 Enrollee's Rights to Advance Directives

          The Contractor shall, in compliance with the requirements of 42 CFR
          434.28, maintain written policies and procedures regarding advance
          directives and inform each Enrollee in writing at the time of
          enrollment of an individual's rights under State law to formulate
          advance directives and of the Contractor's policies regarding the
          implementation of such rights. The Contractor shall include in such
          written notice to the Enrollee materials relating to advance
          directives and health care proxies as specified in 10 NYCRR Sections
          98.14(f) and 700.5.

     13.7 Approval of Written Notices

          The Contractor shall submit the format and content of all written
          notifications described in this Section to LDSS for review and prior
          approval by LDSS or SDOH. All written notifications must be written at
          a fourth (4th) to sixth (6th) grade level and in at least ten (10)
          point print.

     13.8  Contractor's Duty to Report Lack of Contact

           The Contractor must inform the LDSS of any Enrollee they are unable
           to contact within ninety (90) days of enrollment using reasonable
           efforts as defined in Section 13.5 of the Agreement and who have not
           presented for any health care services through the Contractor or its
           Participating Providers.

     13.9  Contractor Responsibility to Notify Enrollee of Expected Effective
           Date of Enrollment

           The Contractor must notify the Enrollee of the expected Effective
           Date of Enrollment. In the event that the actual Effective Date of
           Enrollment is different from that given to the Enrollee, the
           Contractor must notify the Enrollee of the actual date of enrollment.
           This may be accomplished through a Welcome Letter. To the extent
           practicable, such notification must precede the Effective Date of
           Enrollment.

     13.10 LDSS Notification of Enrollee's Change in Address

           package change to Enrollees in the Contractor's plan. Notification to
           Enrollees must be provided at least 30 days in advance of the
           effective date of such change.

     13.12 Contractor Responsibility to Notify Enrollee of Termination, Service
           Area Changes and Network Changes

           With prior notice to and approval of the SDOH and LDSS, the
           Contractor shall inform each Enrollee in writing of any withdrawal by
           the Contractor from the Medicaid managed care program pursuant to
           Section 2.7, withdrawal from the Service Area encompassing the
           Enrollee's zip code, and/or significant changes to the Contractor's
           provider network pursuant to Section 21.1(d), except that the
           Contractor need not notify Enrollees who will not be affected by such
           changes.

           The Contractor shall provide the notifications within the timeframes
           specified by SDOH and LDSS, and shall obtain the prior approval of

               shall be authorized by the Contractor for the transitional
               period only if the Non-Participating Provider agrees to:

                    established by the Contractor as payment in full, which
                    rates shall be no more than the level of reimbursement

               The Contractor shall permit an Enrollee, whose health care
               provider has left the Contractor's network of providers, for
               reasons other than imminent harm to patient care, a determination
               of fraud or a final disciplinary action by a state licensing
               board that impairs the health professional's ability to practice,
               to continue an ongoing course of treatment with the Enrollee's
               current health care provider during a transitional period,

               Non-Participating Provider, such care shall be authorized by the
               Contractor for the transitional period only if the
               Non-Participating Provider agrees to:

               i)   accept reimbursement from the Contractor at rates
                    established by the Contractor as payment in full, which
                    rates shall be no more than the level of reimbursement
                    applicable to similar providers within the Contractor's
                    network for such services;

               information needed to perform utilization review as specified in
               42 CFR Sections 456.111 and 456.211. The Contractor's approved
               quality assurance program must be kept on file by the Contractor
               and the LDSS. The Contractor shall not modify the quality
               assurance program without the prior written approval of the
               SDOH, and notice to the LDSS.

          b)   The Contractor shall incorporate the findings from reports in
               Section 18 of this Agreement into its quality assurance program.

               specifies the expected level of improvement and timeframes for
               actions expected to result in such improvement. In the event that
               such approved plan does not result in the expected level of
               improvement, the Contractor shall work with the SDOH and the
               LDSS to develop and implement alternative plans to achieve
               improvement. The Contractor agrees to meet with the SDOH and LDSS

          identifying providers who do not adhere to practice guidelines and for
          making reasonable efforts to improve the performance of these
          providers. Annually, the Contractor shall select a minimum of two
          practice guidelines and monitor

21.   PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS

      21.1  Network Requirements

            a)    Sufficient Number

                  i)    The Contractor will establish and maintain a network of
                        Participating Providers.

                  ii)   The Contractor's network must contain all of the
                        provider types necessary to furnish the prepaid Benefit
                        Package, including but not limited to: hospitals,
                        physicians (primary care and specialists), mental health
                        and substance abuse providers, allied health
                        professionals, ancillary providers, DME providers and
                        home health providers.

                  iii)  To be considered accessible the network must contain a
                        sufficient number and array of providers to meet the
                        diverse needs of the Enrollee population. This includes
                        being geographically accessible (meeting time/distance
                        standards) and being accessible for the disabled.

                  iv)   The Contractor shall not include in its network any
                        provider who has been sanctioned or prohibited from
                        serving Medicaid recipients or receiving Medical
                        Assistance payments.

            b)    Absence of Appropriate Network Provider

                  In the event that the Contractor determines that it does not
                  have a Participating Provider with appropriate training and
                  experience to meet the particular health care needs of an
                  Enrollee, the Contractor shall make a referral to an
                  appropriate Non-Participating Provider, pursuant to a
                  treatment plan approved by the Contractor in consultation with
                  the Primary Care Provider, the Non-Participating Provider and
                  the Enrollee or the Enrollee's designee. The Contractor shall
                  pay for the cost of the services in the treatment plan
                  provided by the Non-Participating Provider.

            c)    Suspension of Enrollee Assignments To Providers

                  The Contractor shall ensure that there is sufficient capacity,
                  consistent with SDOH standards, to serve Enrollees under this
                  Agreement. In the event any of the Contractor's Participating
                  Providers are no longer able to accept assignment of new
                  Enrollees due to capacity limitations, as determined by the
                  SDOH and the LDSS, the Contractor will suspend assignment of
                  any additional Enrollees to such Participating Provider until
                  it is capable of further accepting Enrollees. When a
                  Participating Provider has more than one (1) site, the
                  suspension will be made by site.

            d)    Notice of Provider Termination

                  The Contractor shall notify LDSS and SDOH of any notice of
                  termination of

                  an IPA, hospital or medical group provider agreement which
                  affects an Enrollee's access to care.

                  Such notification to the LDSS and the SDOH shall be made
                  ninety (90) days prior to the effective date of the
                  termination of the provider agreement or immediately upon
                  notice from such provider if less than ninety (90) days.

                  The Contractor shall also notify LDSS and SDOH in the event
                  that the Contractor and the providers have failed to
                  re-execute a renewal provider agreement forty-five (45) days
                  prior to the expiration of the agreement.

                  The Contractor shall submit a contingency plan to LDSS and
                  SDOH, at least forty-five (45) days prior to the termination
                  of expiration of the agreement, identifying the number of
                  Enrollees affected by the potential withdrawal, if applicable,
                  and specifying how services previously furnished by the
                  participating providers will be provided in the event of their
                  withdrawal. If the provider is a participating hospital, the
                  Contractor shall identify the number of doctors who would not
                  have admitting privileges in the absence of such participating
                  hospital.

                  The Contractor shall develop a transition plan for patients of
                  the departing providers subject to approval by LDSS and SDOH.
                  SDOH and LDSS may direct the Contractor to provide notice to
                  the patients of PCPs or specialists including available
                  options for the patients, and availability of continuing care,
                  consistent with ss.13.7, not less than thirty (30) days prior
                  to the termination of the provider agreement. In the event
                  that provider agreements are terminated with less than the
                  notice period required by this section, the Contractor shall
                  immediately notify LDSS and SDOH, and develop a transition
                  plan on an expedited basis and provide notice to patients
                  subject to the consent of LDSS and SDOH.

                  Upon Contractor notice of failure to re-execute, or
                  termination of, a provider agreement, the SDOH and the LDSS,
                  in their sole discretion, may waive the requirement of
                  submission of a contingency plan upon a determination by the
                  SDOH and the LDSS that:

                  i)    the impact upon Enrollees is not significant, and/or

                  ii)   the Contractor and provider are continuing to negotiate
                        in good faith and consent to extend the provider
                        agreement for a period of time necessary to provide not
                        less than thirty (30) days notice to Enrollees.

                  SDOH and the LDSS reserve the right to take any other actions
                  permitted by this Agreement and under regulatory or statutory
                  authority, including but not limited to contract termination.

      21.2  Credentialing

            a)    Licensure

                  The Contractor shall ensure, in accordance with Article 44 of
                  the Public Health Law, that persons and entities providing
                  care and services for the Contractor in the capacity of
                  physician, dentist, physician's assistant, registered nurse,

                  certification, or qualification requirements under New York
                  law and that the functions and responsibilities of such
                  persons and entities in providing Benefit Package services
                  under this Agreement do not exceed those permissible under New
                  York law.

            b)    Minimum Standards

                  The Contractor agrees that all network physicians will meet at
                  least one (1) of the following standards, except as specified
                  in Section 21.13(b) and Appendix I of this agreement:
                  i)   Be board-certified or -eligible in their area of

                  ii)  Have completed an accredited residency program; or
                  iii) Have admitting privileges at one (1) or more hospitals
                       participating in the Contractor's network.

            c)    Credentialing/Recredentialing Process

                  The Contractor shall have in place a formal process for
                  credentialing Participating Providers on a periodic basis (not
                  less than once every three (3) years) and for monitoring
                  Participating Providers performance.

            d)    Application Procedure

                  The Contractor shall establish a written application procedure
                  to be used by a health care professional interested in serving
                  as a Participating Provider with the Contractor. The criteria
                  for selecting providers, including the minimum qualification
                  requirements that a health care professional must meet to be
                  considered by the Contractor must be defined in writing and
                  developed in consultation with appropriately qualified health
                  care professionals. Upon request, the application procedures
                  and minimum qualification requirements must be made available
                  to health care professionals.

      21.3  SDOH Exclusion or Termination of Providers

            If SDOH excludes or terminates a provider from its Medicaid Program,
            the Contractor shall, upon learning of such exclusion or
            termination, immediately terminate the provider agreement with the
            Participating Provider as it pertains to the Contractor's Medicaid
            program, and agrees to no longer utilize the services of the subject
            provider, as applicable. The Contractor shall access information
            pertaining to excluded Medicaid providers through the SDOH Health
            Provider Network (HPN). Such information available to the Contractor
            on the HPN shall be deemed to constitute constructive notice. The
            HPN should not be the sole basis for identifying current exclusions
            or termination of previously approved providers. Should the
            Contractor become aware, through the HPN or any other source, of an
            SDOH exclusion or termination, the Contractor shall validate this
            information with the Office of Medicaid Management, Bureau of
            Enforcement Activities and comply with the provisions of this
            Section.

      21.4  Evaluation Information

            The Contractor shall develop and implement policies and procedures
            to ensure that health care professionals are regularly advised of
            information maintained by the Contractor to evaluate the performance
            or practice of health care professionals. The Contractor shall
            consult with health care professionals in developing methodologies
            to collect and analyze health care professional profiling data. The
            Contractor shall provide any such information and profiling data and
            analysis to health care professionals. Such information, data or
            analysis shall be provided on a periodic basis appropriate to the
            nature and amount of data and the volume and scope of services
            provided. Any profiling data used to evaluate the performance or
            practice of a health care professional shall be measured against
            stated criteria and an appropriate group of health care
            professionals using similar treatment modalities serving a
            comparable patient population. Upon presentation of such information
            or data, each health care professional shall be given the
            opportunity to discuss the unique nature of the health care
            professional's patient population which may have a bearing on the
            health care professional's profile and to work cooperatively with
            the Contractor to improve performance.

      21.5  Payment In Full

            Contractor must limit participation to providers who agree that
            payment received from the Contractor for services included in the
            Benefit Package is payment in full for services provided to
            Enrollees.

      21.6  Choice/Assignment of PCP's

            a)    The Contractor shall offer each Enrollee the choice of no
                  fewer than three (3) Primary Care Providers within program
                  distance/travel time standards. Contractor must assign a PCP
                  to individuals that fail to select a PCP. The assignment of a
                  PCP by the Contractor may occur after written notification of
                  Contractor by LDSS of the enrollment (through Roster or other
                  method) and after written notification of the Enrollee by the
                  Contractor but in no event later than thirty (30) days after
                  notification of enrollment, and only after the Contractor has
                  made reasonable efforts as set forth in Section 13 of this
                  Agreement to contact the Enrollee and inform him/her of
                  his/her right to choose a PCP.

            b)    PCP assignments should be made taking into consideration the
                  following:
                  i)   Enrollee's geographic location;
                  ii)  any special health care needs, if known by the
                       Contractor; and
                  iii) any special language needs, if known by the Contractor.

            c)    In circumstances where the Contractor operates or contracts
                  with a multi-provider clinic to deliver primary care services,
                  the Enrollee must choose or be assigned a specific provider or
                  provider team within the clinic to serve as his/her PCP. This
                  "lead" provider will be held accountable for performing the
                  PCP duties.

      21.7  PCP Changes

            a)    The Contractor must allow Enrollees the freedom to change
                  PCPs, without cause, within thirty (30) days of the Enrollee's
                  first appointment with the PCP. After the first thirty (30)
                  days PCP may be changed once every six (6) months without
                  cause.

            b)    The Contractor must process a request to change PCPs and
                  advise the Enrollee of the effective date of the change within
                  forty-five (45) days of receipt of the request. The change
                  must be effective no later than the first (1st) day of the
                  second (2nd) month following the month in which the request is
                  made.

            c)    The Contractor will provide Enrollees with an opportunity to
                  select a new PCP in the event that the Enrollee's current PCP
                  leaves the network or otherwise becomes unavailable. Such
                  changes shall not be considered in the calculation of changes
                  for cause allowed within a six (6) month period.

            d)    In the event that an assignment of a new PCP is necessary due
                  to the unavailability of the Enrollee's former PCP, such
                  assignment shall be

<PAGE>

                  made in accordance with the requirements of Section 21.6 of
                  this Agreement.

            e)    In addition to those conditions and circumstances under which
                  the Contractor may assign an Enrollee a PCP when the Enrollee
                  fails to make an affirmative choice of a PCP, the Contractor
                  may initiate a PCP change for an Enrollee under the following
                  circumstances:

                  i)    The Enrollee requires specialized care for an acute or
                        chronic condition and the Enrollee and Contractor agree
                        that reassignment to a different PCP is in the
                        Enrollee's interest.

                  ii)   The Enrollee's place of residence has changed such that
                        he/she has moved beyond the PCP travel time/distance
                        standard.

                  iii)  The Enrollee's PCP ceases to participate in the
                        Contractor's network.

                  iv)   The Enrollee's behavior toward the PCP is disruptive and
                        the PCP has made all reasonable efforts to accommodate
                        the Enrollee.

                  v)    The Enrollee has taken legal action against the PCP.

            f)    Whenever initiating a change, the Contractor must offer
                  affected Enrollees the opportunity to select a new PCP in the
                  manner described in this Section.

      21.8  Provider Status Changes

               The Contractor agrees to notify its Enrollees of any of the
               following PCP changes:

               a) Enrollees will be notified within fifteen (15) days from the
                  date on which the Contractor becomes aware that such
                  Enrollee's PCP has changed his or her office address or
                  telephone number.

               b) If a PCP ceases participation in the Contractor's network, the
                  Contractor shall provide written notice within fifteen (15)
                  days from the date that the Contractor becomes aware of such
                  change in status to each Enrollee who has chosen the provider
                  as their PCP. In such cases, the notice shall describe the
                  procedures for choosing an alternative PCP and, in the event
                  that the Enrollee is in an ongoing course of treatment, the
                  procedures for continuing care consistent with subdivision 6
                  (e) of PHL Section 4403.

               c) Where an Enrollee's PCP ceases participation with the
                  Contractor, the Contractor must ensure that a new PCP is
                  assigned within thirty (30) days of the date of the notice to
                  the Enrollee.

            2) Other Provider Changes

                  services to such Enrollee, the Contractor shall provide
                  written notice to the Enrollee within fifteen (15) days from
                  the date on which the Contractor becomes aware of the
                  Participating Provider's unavailability to the Enrollee. In
                  such cases, the notice shall describe the procedures for
                  continuing care consistent with subdivision (e) of PHL
                  Section 4403 and for choosing an alternative provider.

      21.9  PCP Responsibilities

            In conformance with the Benefit Package, the PCP shall provide
            health counseling and advice; conduct baseline and periodic health
            examinations; diagnose and treat conditions not requiring the
            services of a specialist; arrange inpatient care, consultation, with
            specialists, and laboratory and radiological services when medically
            necessary; coordinate the findings of consultants and laboratories;
            and interpret such findings to the Enrollee and the Enrollee's
            family, subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 20 of
            this Agreement, and maintain a current medical record for the
            Enrollee. The PCP shall also be responsible for determining the
            urgency of a consultation with a specialist and shall arrange for
            all consultation appointments within appropriate time frames.

      21.10 Member to Provider Ratios

            The Contractor agrees to adhere to the member-to-PCP ratios shown
            below. These ratios are for Medicaid Enrollees only, are
            Contractor-specific, and assume the practitioner is a full time
            equivalent (FTE) (defined as a provider practicing forty (40) hours
            per week for the Contractor):

            i)    No more than 1,500 Medicaid Enrollees for each physician, or
                  2,400 for a physician practicing in combination with a
                  registered physician assistant or a certified nurse
                  practitioner.

            ii)   No more than 1,000 Medicaid Enrollees for each certified
                  nurse practitioner.

            The Contractor agrees that these ratios will be prorated for
            Participating Providers who represent less than a FTE to the
            Contractor.

            administrative staff, medical and non-medical and case management

            FQHC in its Service Area. Written requests for exemption from this
            requirement are subject to approval by HCFA.

            When the Contractor is participating in a county where an MCO that
            is sponsored, owned and/or operated by one or more FQHCs exists, the
            Contractor is not required to include any FQHCs within its network

            The Contractor shall not terminate a contract with a health care

            c)    a time limit of not less than thirty (30) days within which a
                  health care professional may request a hearing; and

            d)    a time limit for a hearing date which must be held within
                  thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of a request for a
                  hearing.

            No contract or agreement between the Contractor and a health care
            professional shall contain any provision which shall supersede or
            impair a health care professional's right to notice of reasons for
            termination and the opportunity for a hearing or review concerning
            such termination.

      22.10 Health Care Professional Hearings

            A health care professional that has been notified of his or her
            proposed termination must be allowed a hearing. The procedures for
            this hearing must meet the following standards:

            a)    The hearing panel shall be comprised of at least three persons
                  appointed by the Contractor. At least one person on such panel
                  shall be a clinical peer in the same discipline and the same
                  or similar specialty as the health care professional under
                  review. The hearing panel may consist of more than three
                  persons, provided however that the number of clinical peers on
                  such panel shall constitute one-third or more of the total
                  membership of the panel.

            b)    The hearing panel shall render a decision on the proposed
                  action in a timely manner. Such decision shall include
                  reinstatement of the health care professional by the
                  Contractor, provisional reinstatement subject to conditions
                  set forth by the Contractor or termination of the health care
                  professional. Such decision shall be provided in writing to
                  the health care professional.

            c)    A decision by the hearing panel to terminate a health care
                  professional shall be effective not less than thirty (30) days
                  after the receipt by the health care professional of the
                  hearing panel's decision. Notwithstanding the termination of a
                  health care professional for cause or pursuant to a hearing, a
                  plan shall permit an Enrollee to continue an on-going course
                  of treatment for a transition period of up to ninety (90)
                  days, and post-partum care, subject to provider agreement,
                  pursuant to PHL sec. 4406(6)(e).

            d)    In no event shall termination be effective earlier than sixty
                  (60) days from the receipt of the notice of termination.

      22.11 Non-Renewal of Provider Agreements

            Either party to a contract may exercise a right of non-renewal at
            the expiration of the contract period set forth therein or, for a
            contract without a specific expiration date, on each January first
            occurring after the contract has been in effect for at least one
            year, upon sixty (60) days notice to the other party; provided,
            however, that any non-renewal shall not constitute a termination for
            the purposes of this Section.

                                   SECTION 22

      22.12 Physician Incentive Plan

            If Contractor elects to operate a Physician Incentive Plan,
            Contractor agrees that no specific payment will be made directly or
            indirectly under the plan to a physician or physician group as an
            inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished
            to an Enrollee. Contractor agrees to submit to SDOH annual reports
            containing the information on its physician incentive plan in
            accordance with 42 CFR ss. 434.70. The contents of such reports
            shall comply with the requirements of 42 CFR ss. 417.479 and be in a
            format to be provided by SDOH.

            The Contractor must ensure that any agreements for contracted
            services covered by this Agreement, such as agreements between the
            Contractor and other entities or between the Contractor's
            subcontracted entities and their contractors, at all levels
            including the physician level, include language requiring that the
            physician incentive plan information be provided by the
            sub-contractor in an accurate and timely manner to the Contractor,
            in the format requested by SDOH.

            In the event that the incentive arrangements place the physician or
            physician group at risk for services beyond those provided directly
            by the physician or physician group for an amount beyond the risk
            threshold of 25% of potential payments for covered services
            (substantial financial risk), the Contractor must comply with all
            additional requirements listed in regulation, such as: conduct
            enrollee/disenrollee satisfaction surveys; disclose the requirements
            for the physician incentive plans to its beneficiaries upon request;
            and ensure that all physicians and physician groups at substantial
            financial risk have adequate stop-loss protection. Any of these
            additional requirements that are passed on to the subcontractors
            must be clearly stated in their Agreement.

23.   FRAUD AND ABUSE PREVENTION PLAN

      A Fraud and Abuse Prevention Plan for the detection, investigation and
      prevention of fraudulent activities must be filed by the Contractor with
      the Commissioner of Health to the extent required by SDOH regulations. A
      copy of this plan must be submitted to the LDSS, upon request of the LDSS.

24.   AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT COMPLIANCE PLAN

      Contractor must comply with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities
      Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 for program
      accessibility, and must develop an ADA Compliance Plan consistent with
      the SDOH Guidelines for Medicaid MCO Compliance with the ADA which are set
      forth in Appendix J, which is hereby made a part of this Agreement as if
      set forth fully herein. Said plan must be approved by the SDOH and/or the
      LDSS, and filed with the Contractor, SDOH and the LDSS.

25.   FAIR HEARINGS

      25.1  Enrollee Access To Fair Hearing Process

            Enrollees may access the fair hearing process in accordance with
            applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Contractors must
            abide by and participate in New York State's Fair Hearing Process
            and comply with determinations made by a fair hearing officer.

      25.2  Enrollee Rights to a Fair Hearing

            Enrollees may request a fair hearing regarding adverse LDSS
            determinations concerning enrollment, disenrollment and eligibility,
            and regarding the denial, termination, suspension or reduction of a
            clinical treatment or other Benefit Package services by the
            Contractor. For issues related to disputed services, Enrollees must
            have received an adverse determination from the Contractor or its
            approved utilization review agent either overriding a recommendation
            to provide services by a Participating Provider or confirming the
            decision of a Participating Provider to deny those services. An
            Enrollee may also seek a fair hearing for a failure by the
            Contractor to act with reasonable promptness with respect to such
            services. Reasonable promptness shall mean compliance with the time
            frames established for review of grievances and utilization review
            in Sections 44 and 49 of the Public Health Law.

      25.3  Contractor Notice to Enrollees

            a)    Contractor must issue a written Notice of Adverse
                  Determination and Fair Hearing Rights to any Enrollee:

                  ii)    When an Enrollee is denied a requested service or
                         benefit by an MCO provider and has exhausted the
                         Contractor's approved internal complaint and appeal
                         procedures or utilization review processes; or

            d)    The Contractor's Notice of Adverse Determination and Notice
                  of a Right to Request a Fair Hearing for Article 49
                  Utilization Review Determinations shall include the following:

                  (i)    a description of the action Contractor intends to take;

      25.4  Aid Continuing

            Contractor shall be required to continue the provision of the
            Benefit Package services that are the subject of the fair hearing to
            an Enrollee (hereafter referred to as "aid continuing") if so
            ordered by the OAH under the following circumstances:

                  i)     Contractor has or is seeking to reduce, suspend or
                         terminate a treatment or Benefit Package service
                         currently being provided;

                  ii)    Enrollee has filed a timely request for a fair hearing
                         with OAH; and

                  iii)   There is a valid order for the treatment or service
                         from a participating provider. Contractor shall provide
                         aid continuing until the matter has been resolved to
                         the Enrollee's satisfaction or until the administrative
                         process is completed and there is a determination from
                         OAH that Enrollee is not entitled to receive the
                         service, the Enrollee withdraws the request for aid
                         continuing and/or the fair hearing in writing, or the
                         treatment or service originally ordered by the provider
                         has been completed, whichever occurs first.

                  iv)    If the services and/or benefits in dispute have been
                         terminated, suspended or reduced and the Enrollee
                         timely requests a fair hearing, Contractor shall, at
                         the direction of either SDOH or LDSS, restore the
                         disputed services and/or benefits consistent with the
                         provisions of Section 25.4(iii) of this Agreement.

      25.5  Responsibilities of SDOH

            SDOH will make every reasonable effort to ensure that the Contractor
            receives timely notice in writing by fax, or e-mail, of all
            requests, schedules and directives regarding fair hearings.

      25.6  Contractor's Obligations

            a)    Contractor shall appear at all scheduled fair hearings
                  concerning its clinical determinations and/or Contractor-
                  initiated disenrollments to present evidence as justification
                  for its determination or submit written evidence as
                  justification for its determination regarding the disputed
                  benefits and/or services. If Contractor will not be making a
                  personal appearance at the fair hearing, the written material
                  must be submitted to OAH and Enrollee or Enrollee's
                  representative at least three (3) business days prior to the
                  scheduled hearing. If the hearing is scheduled fewer than
                  three (3) business days after the request, Contractor must
                  deliver the evidence to the hearing site no later than one
                  (1) business day prior to the hearing, otherwise Contractor
                  must appear in person. Notwithstanding the above provisions,
                  Contractor may be required to make a personal appearance at
                  the discretion of the hearing officer and/or SDOH.

            b)    Despite an Enrollee's request for a State fair hearing in any
                  given dispute, Contractor is required to maintain and operate
                  in good faith its own internal

                             SECTION 23 - SECTION 37

                  complaint and appeal process as required under state and
                  federal laws and by Section 14 and Appendix F of this
                  Agreement. Enrollees may seek redress of adverse
                  determinations simultaneously through Contractor's internal
                  process and the State fair hearing process. If Contractor has
                  reversed its initial determination and provided the service to
                  the Enrollee, Contractor may request a waiver from appearing
                  at the hearing and, in submitted papers, explain that it has
                  withdrawn its initial determination and is providing the
                  service or treatment formerly in dispute.

            c)    Contractor shall comply with all determinations rendered by
                  OAH at fair hearings. Contractor shall cooperate with SDOH
                  efforts to ensure that Contractor is in compliance with fair
                  hearing determinations. Failure by Contractor to maintain such
                  compliance shall constitute breach of this Agreement. Nothing
                  in this Section shall limit the remedies available to SDOH,
                  LDSS or the federal government relating to any non-compliance
                  by Contractor with a fair hearing determination or
                  Contractor's refusal to provide disputed services.

            d)    If SDOH investigates a complaint that has as its basis the
                  same dispute that is the subject of a pending fair hearing
                  and, as a result of its investigation, concludes that the
                  disputed services and/or benefits should be provided to the
                  Enrollee, Contractor shall comply with SDOH's directive to
                  provide those services and/or benefits and provide notice to
                  OAH and Enrollee as required by Section 25.6(b) of this
                  Agreement.

            e)    If SDOH, through its complaint investigation process, or OAH,
                  by a determination after a fair hearing, directs Contractor to
                  provide a service that was initially denied by Contractor,
                  Contractor may either directly provide the service, arrange
                  for the provision of that service or pay for the provision of
                  that service by a Non-Participating Provider.

            f)    Contractor agrees to abide by changes made to this Section of
                  the Agreement with respect to the fair hearing, grievance and
                  complaint processes by SDOH in order to comply with any
                  amendments to applicable state or federal statutes or
                  regulations. Such changes shall become effective without need
                  for any further action by the parties to this Agreement.

            g)    Contractor agrees to identify a contact person within its
                  organization who will serve as a liaison to SDOH for the

determination of medical necessity shall include positive evidence of pregnancy,
with an estimate of its duration.

When clinically indicated, the following services may be provided as a part of a
family planning and reproductive health visit:

   GUIDELINES FOR PLANS THAT INCLUDE FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
                        SERVICES IN THEIR BENEFIT PACKAGE

If the Contractor includes family planning and reproductive health services in
its benefit package, the Contractor must notify all Enrollees of reproductive
age (including minors who may be sexually active) at the time of enrollment
about their right to obtain family planning and reproductive health services and
supplies from any network or non-network provider without referral or approval.
The notification must contain the following:

1)    notification of the Medicaid Enrollee's right to obtain the full range of
      family planning and reproductive health services (including HIV
      counseling and testing when performed as part of a family planning
      encounter) from ether a Contractor's participating provider or any
      qualified non-network provider who accepts Medicaid who undertakes to
      provide such services to them, without referral, approval or notification;

2)    a current list of qualified network family planning providers, within the
      geographic area, including addresses and telephone numbers, who provide
      the full range of family planning and reproductive health services.
      Contractor may also choose to provide a list of qualified non-network
      Medicaid providers who provide the full range of family planning and
      reproductive health services;

3)    information that the cost of the Enrollee's care will be fully covered by
      Medicaid, when services are obtained in accordance with #1 above,
      regardless of where the Enrollee obtains services.

The Contractor must notify its participating providers that all claims for

fee-for-service program.

      or LDSS to the plan and mailed with the first new member communication,
      prior to the enrollment effective date.

7)    If an Enrollee or prospective Enrollee requests information about these

      mailed. The Contractor will review this log monthly and upon request,
      submit a copy to SDOH or the LDSS.

9)    Mechanisms to inform participating providers that, if requested by the
      Enrollee, or, if in the provider's best professional judgement, certain

            policy. The Contractor's orientation program will include a thorough
            discussion of all aspects of this policy and procedure. Annual

            public service announcements, printed publications, and other
            broadcast or electronic messages designed to increase awareness and
            interest in Medicaid managed care and/or a MCO's Medicaid managed
            care product. The target audience for these marketing materials is

            care plan, and who are living in a defined service area.

      b)    Marketing materials include any information that references the
            Medicaid managed care program, is intended for general distribution,
            and is produced in a variety of print, broadcast, and direct
            marketing mediums. These generally include: radio, television,
            billboards, newspapers, leaflets, informational brochures, videos,
            telephone book yellow page ads, letters, and posters. Additional
            materials requiring marketing approval include a listing of items to

            Enrollees of the Contractor in any county of the service area speak
            that particular language and do not speak English as a first
            language. SDOH will inform the LDSS and LDSS will inform the
            Contractor when the 5% threshold has been reached. Marketing
            materials to be translated include those key materials, such as
            informational brochures, that are produced for routine distribution,
            and which are included within the MCO's marketing plan. SDOH will

            county specific census data or other available measures.

      c)    Alternate forms of communications must be provided for persons with
            visual, hearing, speech, physical, or developmental disabilities.

            available to Enrollees after they join a plan, such as "If you join
            the XYZ Plan, you will receive a free baby carriage after you
            complete eight prenatal visits."

      i)    Marketing materials that are prepared for distribution or
            presentation by the LDSS or enrollment broker must be provided in a
            manner that is easily understood and appropriate to the target
            audience. The material covered must include sufficient information
            to assist the individual in making an informed choice of MCO.

      j)    The MCO shall advise potential Enrollees, in written materials
            related to enrollment, to verify with the medical services providers
            they prefer, or have an existing relationship with, that such

C. MARKETING ACTIVITIES

1. Definitions

      a)    Marketing activities are occasions during which marketing
            information and material regarding Medicaid managed care and
            information about a particular MCO's affiliated products are
            presented. Typically, such information is presented both in verbal
            exchanges and through the distribution of written materials,
            together with the giving away of nominal gifts. The informal nature
            of the marketing activity requires MCOs to be forthright in their
            presentations to allow potential Enrollees the exercise of informed
            choice, and localities must provide the best assurances that
            marketing practices are consistent with established guidelines. Any
            exchange of verbal marketing information must include the following:

            i)    if the plan is not capitated for family planning services, the
                  representative must tell potential Enrollees that:

                  a)    certain family planning and reproductive health services
                        (such as abortion, sterilization and birth control) are
                        not covered by the Contractor;

                  b)    whenever needed, such services may be obtained through
                        fee-for-service Medicaid from any provider who accepts
                        Medicaid;

                  c)    no referral is needed for such services;

                  d)    there will be no cost to the enrollee for such services.

      b)    With prior local approval MCO's may engage in marketing activities
            that include community-sponsored social gatherings, provider-hosted
            informational sessions, or MCO-sponsored events. Events may include
            such activities as health fairs workshops on health promotion,
            holiday parties, after school programs, raffles, etc. These events
            must not be restricted to Medicaid Recipients only.

      c)    Media campaigns are the distribution of information/materials
            regarding the Medicaid managed care program and/or a specific MCO
            for the purpose of encouraging Medicaid recipients to join a managed
            care plan. All mediums--including television, radio, billboards,
            subway and bus posters, and electronic messages--must be
            pre-approved by the SDOH at least thirty (30) days prior to the
            campaign. A copy must be simultaneously submitted to the SDOH and
            the LDSS.

2. Marketing Sites

      a)    With prior LDSS approval, MCOS may distribute approved marketing
            material in such places as, an income support maintenance center,
            community centers (if the center agrees and allows all MCOs to use

            sites, schools, health fairs, a resource center established by the

      b)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from door-to-door solicitation of potential
            Enrollees, or distribution of material, and may not engage in "cold
            calling" inquiries or solicitation.

      c)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from direct marketing or distribution of
            material in hospital emergency rooms including emergency room
            waiting areas. Marketing may not take place in patient rooms or
            treatment areas (except for waiting areas) or other prohibited sites
            unless requested by the individual. LDSS may not allow MCO to market
            in individual homes without permission of the individual.

      d)    MCOs may not require its Participating Providers to distribute
            plan-prepared communications to their patients.

      e)    Participating Providers may display the marketing materials of their
            contracting MCOs provided that appropriate notice is conspicuously
            posted for all other MCOs with whom the Provider has a contract.

      f)    Participating Providers are encouraged to communicate with their
            patients about managed care options and to advise their patients in
            determining the MCO that best meets the health needs of the patient
            and his/her family. Such advice, whether presented verbally or in
            writing, must be individually based and not merely a promotion of
            one plan over another. Providers who wish to let their patients know
            of their affiliation with one or more MCOs must list each MCO with
            whom they hold contracts. In the event marketing material is
            included with such communication, the material, together with the
            intended communication, must be pre-approved by the LDSS before
            distribution.

      g)    In the event a provider is no longer affiliated with a particular
            MCO but remains affiliated with other participant MCOs, the provider
            may notify his/her/its patients of the new status and the impact of
            such change on the patient.

3 Restricted Marketing Activities

      a)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from misrepresenting the Medicaid program, the
            Medicaid managed care program, or the program or policy requirements
            of the LDSS or the SDOH.

      b)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from purchasing or otherwise acquiring or using
            mailing lists of Medicaid recipients from third party vendors,
            including providers and LDSS offices.

      c)    MCOs are PROHIBITED from using raffle tickets and event attendance
            or sign-in sheets to develop mailing lists of potential Enrollees.

                                   APPENDIX D
                                 October 1, 2004
                                       D-8

<PAGE>

      d)    MCOs may not discriminate against a potential Enrollee based on
            his/her current health status or anticipated need for future health
            care. The MCO may not discriminate on the basis of disability or
            perceived disability of an Enrollee or their family member. Health
            assessments may not be performed by MCOs prior to enrollment. MCOs
            may inquire about existing primary care relationships of the
            applicant and explain whether and how such relationships may be
            maintained. Upon request, each potential Enrollee shall be provided
            with a listing of all Participating Providers including specialists
            and facilities in the MCO's network. The MCO may respond to a
            potential Enrollee's question about whether a particular specialist
            is in the network. However, MCOs are prohibited from inquiring about
            the types of specialists utilized by the potential Enrollee.

      e)    MCOs may not offer incentives of any kind to Medicaid recipients to
            join a health plan. "Incentives" are defined as any type of
            inducement whose receipt is contingent upon the recipients joining
            the plan.

      f)    MCOs are responsible for ensuring that their marketing
            representatives engage in professional and courteous behavior in
            their interactions with LDSS staff, staff from other health plans,
            and Medicaid clients. Examples of inappropriate behavior include
            interfering with other health plan presentations, talking negatively
            about another health plan, and participating with Medicaid clients
            during the verification interview with LDSS staff.

      g)    MCOs may offer nominal gifts of not more than $5.00 in fair-market
            value as part of a health fair or other marketing activity to
            stimulate interest in managed care and/or the MCO. Such gifts must
            be pre-approved by the LDSS, and offered without regard to
            enrollment. The MCO must submit a listing of intended items to be
            distributed at marketing activities as nominal gifts. The submission
            of actual samples or photographs of intended nominal gifts will not
            be routinely required, but must be made available upon request by
            the state or local reviewer. Listings of item donors or co-sponsors
            must be submitted along with the description of items.

      h)    MCOs may offer its Enrollees rewards for completing a health goal,
            such as finishing all prenatal visits, participating in a smoking
            cessation session, attending initial orientation sessions upon
            enrollment, and timely completion of immunizations or other health
            related programs. Such rewards may not exceed $50.00 in fair-market
            value per Enrollee over a twelve (12) month period, and must be
            related to a health goal. MCOs may not make reference to these
            rewards in their pre-enrollment marketing materials or discussions
            and all such rewards must be approved by the LDSS.

      i)    MCOs may not offer compensation to marketing representatives,
            including salary increases or bonuses, based solely on the number of
            individuals they enroll. However, MCOs may base compensation of
            marketing representatives on periodic performance evaluations which
            consider enrollment productivity as one

            of several performance factors during a performance period, subject
            to the following requirements:

            1)    "Compensation" shall mean any remuneration required to be
                  reported as income or compensation for federal tax purposes;

            2)    MCOs may not pay a "commission" or fixed amount per
                  enrollment;

            3)    Bonuses may not be awarded more frequently than quarterly, and
                  the annual amount awarded as bonus compensation to a marketing
                  representative may not exceed 10% of his/her total annual
                  compensation;

            4)    Performance evaluations used as a basis for such bonus or
                  salary increase shall be set forth in writing and available
                  for inspection by SDOH or the LDSS;

            5)    Other appropriate factors which may be considered by an MCO in
                  awarding merit salary increase or bonuses to marketing

                  -     Ratio of "clean" or successful enrollments submitted;
                        quality of applications;

                  -     Attendance; adherence to marketing schedules; timeliness

                  -     Observed marketing behavior; absence/paucity of
                        complaints regarding marketing conduct

            6)    Affiliated providers engaged in marketing on behalf of an MCO
                  shall be considered "marketing representatives" for purposes
                  of Section C (3)(i) of Appendix D.

      j)    Individuals employed by MCO's as marketing representatives, and
            employees of marketing subcontractors must have successfully
            completed a training program about the basic concepts of managed
            care and the Medicaid recipients' rights and responsibilities
            relating to membership in managed care. MCOs must submit a copy of
            the training curriculum for their marketing representatives to SDOH
            and the LDSS as part of the marketing plan. The MCO shall be
            responsible for the activities of its marketing representatives and
            the activities of any subcontractor or management entity. A
            marketing representative means any individual or entity engaged by
            the Contractor to market on behalf of the Contractor.

D. MARKETING INFRACTIONS

1.    Infractions of the marketing guidelines may result in the following
      actions being taken by the LDSS to protect the interests of the program
      and its clients. These actions shall be taken at the sole discretion of
      the LDSS.

      a)    If an MCO or its representative commits a first time infraction of
            marketing guidelines and the LDSS deems the infraction to be minor
            or unintentional in nature, the LDSS may issue a warning letter to
            the MCO.

      b)    For subsequent or more serious infractions, the LDSS may impose

8.    All disenrollment forms will be submitted to the Rensselaer County Managed
      Care office. The disenrollment forms need to be submitted to Rensselaer
      County Managed Care separately from enrollment forms because of separate
      processing procedures. The County maintains the right to allow for an
      expedited disenrollment on a case by case basis.

9.    Efforts should be made to complete enrollment and disenrollment forms in
      person whenever possible to ensure that potential/active clients have the

10.   The MCO can take applications at health fairs and community events after
      first gaining approval of Rensselaer County Department of Social Services.

      marketer's absence) contact client's chosen provider to ensure that said
      provider is accepting new patients/Medicaid/MCO. Therefore, Rensselaer
      County Managed Care and the MCO's will comply with 364.J.

Rensselaer County DSS will work with the MCO to form a corrective action plan in
all instances whereby the action's/inaction's of a marketer are in question.

These guidelines may be amended by the Managed Care office of Rensselaer County
DSS as situations dictate. The MCO representatives will be notified of any such
changes.

                                  INTRODUCTION

This document contains member handbook guidelines for use by managed care
organizations (MCOs) under contract to serve New York Medicaid beneficiaries.
These guidelines may be revised from time to time based on changes in the law
and the changing needs of the program. The guidelines reflect the review
criteria used by the SDOH Office of Managed Care in its review of all Medicaid
managed care member handbooks. Handbooks and addenda must be approved by SDOH
prior to printing and distribution by MCOs. In addition, the SDOH has developed
a model member handbook at the fourth to sixth grade reading level for use by
MCOs. The model member handbook contains language to address required disclosure
regarding free access for family planning; self referral policies; obtaining
OB/GYN services; the definitions of medical necessity and emergency services;
protocols for complaints, utilization review, external appeals, fair hearings
and newborn enrollments; and listing of member entitlements, including benefits,
rights and responsibilities, and information available upon request. MCOs must
use the language provided in these required disclosure areas in their member
handbooks. A copy of the model handbook is available from the Office of Managed
Care, Bureau of Intergovernmental Affairs.

GENERAL FORMAT

Member handbooks must be written in a style and reading level that will
accommodate the reading skills of many Medicaid recipients. In general the
writing should be at no higher than a sixth-grade level, taking into
consideration the need to incorporate and explain certain technical or
unfamiliar terms to assure accuracy. The text must be printed in at least ten
(10) point font. The SDOH reserves the right to require evidence that a handbook
has been tested against the sixth-grade reading-level standard. Member handbooks
must be available in languages other than English whenever at least five (5)
percent of the potential enrollees of the MCO in any county in the MCO's service
area speak a language other than English as a first language.

            to governmental oversight entities.

      c)    Ensures that the MCO uses complaint information to assess and
            improve program performance.

            are not resolved by the MCO.

PROTOCOL FOR ACCEPTABLE TRANSFER BETWEEN FACILITIES

      All relevant COBRA requirements must be met.

      MCOs must provide for an appropriate (as determined by the ED physician)
      transfer method/level with personnel as needed.

      MCOs must contact/arrange for an available, accepting physician and
      patient bed at the receiving institution.

      If a patient is not transferred within eight (8) hours to an appropriate
      inpatient setting, after the decision to admit has been made, then
      admission at the original facility is deemed authorized.

PROTOCOLS FOR DISPOSITION

      If, pursuant to a screening evaluation, ED staff determines that a patient
      requires further services (other than emergency medical services), the MCO
      will have two (2) hours to respond to a call from the ED with the
      appropriate person to discuss the case. If such response is longer than
      two (2) hours, that admission or treatment is deemed "authorized" for
      purposes of payment.

      In the event that the MCO/provider suggests a level of care for a specific
      patient deemed inappropriate by the attending physician in the ED, and no
      agreement as to disposition can be reached, a physician from the plan must
      physically come to the ED and evaluate/take responsibility for this
      patient.

TRIAGE FEES

      For emergency room services that do not meet the definition of Emergency
      Medical Condition, the MCO shall pay the hospital a triage fee of $40.00
      in the absence of a negotiated rate.

      Non-participating EDs cannot be denied payment on the basis of
      non-notification.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                 SDOH GUIDELINES
              FOR THE PROCESSING OF ENROLLMENTS AND DISENROLLMENTS

This appendix is intended to provide general guidelines to LDSS and MCOs for the
processing of enrollments and disenrollments. Where an enrollment broker exists,
the enrollment broker may be responsible for some or all of the LDSS
responsibilities. To allow LDSS and MCOs flexibility in developing processes
that will meet the needs of both parties, SDOH may allow modifications to
timeframes and some procedures. Modifications are to be specified in Section G
of this Appendix and must be agreed to by both parties and receive prior
approval from SDOH.

A. ENROLLMENT

SDOH RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    The SDOH is responsible for monitoring Local District program activities
      and providing technical assistance to the LDSS and MCOs to ensure
      compliance with the State's policies and procedures.

2.    SDOH reviews and approves proposed enrollment materials prior to MCOs
      publishing and disseminating or otherwise using the materials.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

The LDSS has the primary responsibility for the enrollment process.

1.    Each local district determines Medicaid eligibility. To the extent
      practicable, the LDSS will follow up with Enrollees when the MCO provides
      documentation of any change in status which may affect the Enrollee's
      Medicaid and/or managed care eligibility.

2.    LDSS will provide pre-enrollment information to beneficiaries, consistent
      with Social Services Law, Section 364-j(4)(e)(iv) and train persons
      providing enrollment counseling to beneficiaries.

3.    The LDSS must inform beneficiaries of the availability of MCOs and HIV
      SNPs and the scope of services covered by each.

4.    LDSS will inform beneficiaries of the right to confidential face-to-face
      enrollment counseling and will make confidential face-to-face sessions
      available upon request.

5.    The LDSS shall advise potential Enrollees, in written materials related to
      enrollment, to verify with the medical services providers they prefer, or
      have an existing relationship with that such medical services providers
      participate in the selected managed care provider's network and are
      available to serve the participant.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                 October 1, 2004
                                       H-2

<PAGE>

6.    For enrollments made during face-to-face counseling, if the participant
      has a preference for particular medical services providers, enrollment
      counselors shall verify with the medical services providers that such
      medical services providers whom the participant prefers participate in the
      MCO's network and are available to serve the participant.

7.    The LDSS is responsible for the timely processing of managed care
      enrollment applications, exemptions, and exclusions and ensuring
      attestations are on file for all Enrollees.

8.    The LDSS will determine the status of enrollment applications.
      Applications will be enrolled, pended or denied.

9.    The LDSS will notify the Contractor of plan-assisted enrollment
      applications that are denied.

10.   The LDSS enters individual enrollment form data and transmits that data to
      the State's Prepaid Capitation Plan (PCP) Subsystem. The transfer of
      enrollment information may be accomplished by any of the following:

      i)    LDSS directly enters data into PCP Subsystem; or

      ii)   LDSS or Contractor submits a tape to the State, to be edited and
            entered into PCP Subsystem; or

      iii)  LDSS electronically transfers data, via a dedicated line or Medicaid
            Eligibility Verification System (MEVS) to the PCP Subsystem.

11.   The LDSS is required to send the following notices to Eligible Persons:

      i)    Initial Notification Letter: This letter informs the Eligible
            Persons about the mandatory program and the timeframes for choosing
            a plan. Included with the letter are managed care brochures, an
            enrollment form, and information on their rights and
            responsibilities under this program, including the option for
            HIV/AIDS infected individuals who are categorically exempt from the
            mainstream Medicaid Managed Care program to enroll in an HIV SNP on
            a voluntary basis in districts where HIV SNPs exist. (MANDATORY
            PROGRAM ONLY)

      ii)   Reminder Letter: A letter to all Eligible Persons in a mandatory
            category who have not responded by submitting a completed enrollment
            form within thirty (30) days of being sent or given an enrollment
            packet. (MANDATORY PROGRAM ONLY)

      iii)  Enrollment Confirmation Notice: This notice indicates the Effective
            Date of Enrollment, the name of the MCO and all individuals who are
            being enrolled. This notice should also be used for case additions
            and re-enrollments into the same plan.

      iv)   Notice of Denial of Enrollment: This notice is used when an
            individual has been determined by LDSS to be ineligible for
            enrollment into a Medicaid managed care plan. This notice must
            include fair hearing rights. Note: This notice is not required when
            Medicaid eligibility is being denied (or closed).

                                   APPENDIX H
                                 October 1, 2004
                                       H-3


<PAGE>

      v)    Exemption and Exclusion Request Forms: Exemption forms are provided
            to Eligible Persons upon request if they wish to apply for an
            exemption. Exclusion forms are provided to individuals in New York
            City who self-identify as qualifying for an exclusion. Individuals
            precoded on the system as meeting exemption or exclusion criteria do
            not need to complete an exemption or exclusion request form.

      vi)   Exemption and Exclusion Request Approval or Denial: This notice is
            designed to inform a recipient who applied for an exemption or
            exclusion of the LDSS's disposition of the request, including the
            right to a fair hearing if the request for exemption or exclusion is
            denied.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    In those instances in which the Contractor is marketing to persons
      already in receipt of Medicaid, the Contractor will submit plan
      enrollments to the LDSS, within a maximum of five (5) business days from
      the day the enrollment is received by the Contractor (unless otherwise
      agreed to by SDOH and LDSS).

2.    The Contractor must notify new Enrollees of their Effective Date of
      Enrollment. To the extent practicable, such notification must precede the
      Effective Date of Enrollment. (Section 13 of the Model Contract).

3.    The Contractor must report any changes in status for its enrolled members
      to the LDSS within five (5) business days of such information becoming
      known to the Contractor. This includes, but is not limited to, factors
      that may impact Medicaid eligibility such as address changes, verification
      of pregnancy, incarceration, third party insurance, etc.

4.    The Contractor shall advise potential Enrollees, in written materials
      related to enrollment, to verify with the medical services providers they
      prefer, or have an existing relationship with, that such medical services
      providers participate in the MCO's selected network and are available to
      serve the participant.

5.    The Contractor shall accept all enrollments as ordered by the Office of
      Temporary and Disability Assistance's Office of Administrative Hearings
      due to fair hearing requests or decisions.

B. NEWBORN ENROLLMENTS:

The Contractor agrees to enroll and provide coverage for eligible newborn
children of Enrollees effective from the time of birth.

SDOH Responsibilities:

1.    The SDOH will update WMS with information on the newborn received from
      hospitals, consistent with the requirements of Section 366-g of the Social
      Services Law as amended by Chapter 412 of the Laws of 1999.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                October 1, 2004
                                      H-4

<PAGE>

2.    Upon notification of the birth by the hospital or birthing center, the
      SDOH will update WMS with the demographic data for the newborn and enroll
      the newborn in the mother's MCO if not already enrolled. The newborn will
      be retroactively enrolled back to the first (1st) day of the month of
      birth. Based on the transaction date of the enrollment of the newborn on
      the PCP subsystem, the newborn will appear on either the next month's
      roster or the subsequent month's roster. On plan rosters for upstate and
      NYC, the "PCP Effective From Date" will indicate the first day of the
      month of birth, as described in 01 OMM/ADM 5 "Automatic Medicaid
      Enrollment for Newborns."

LDSS Responsibilities:

1.    Grant Medicaid eligibility for newborns for one (1) year if born to a
      woman eligible for and receiving MA assistance on the date of birth.
      (SOCIAL SERVICES LAW SECTION 366 (4) (1))

2.    LDSS must add eligible unborns to all WMS cases that include a pregnant
      woman as soon as the pregnancy is medically verified. (NYS DSS
      ADMINISTRATIVE DIRECTIVE 85 ADM-33)

3.    In the event that the LDSS learns of an Enrollee's pregnancy prior to the
      Contractor, the LDSS is to establish MA eligibility and enroll the unborn
      in the Contractor's plan.

4.    The LDSS is responsible for newborn enrollment should it not be
      successfully competed under the "SDOH Responsibilities" process as
      outlined in #2 above.

5.    When a newborn is enrolled in managed care, the LDSS must send an
      Enrollment Confirmation Notice to inform the mother of the Effective Date
      of Enrollment, which is the first (1st) day of the month of birth, and the
      plan in which the newborn is enrolled.

6.    The LDSS may develop a transmittal form to be used for unborn/newborn
      notification between the Contractor and the LDSS.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    The Contractor must notify the LDSS in writing of any Enrollee that is
      pregnant within thirty (30) days of knowledge of the pregnancy.
      Notifications should be transmitted to the LDSS at least monthly. The
      notifications should contain the pregnant woman's name, Client ID Number
      (CIN), and the expected date of confinement (EDC).

2.    Upon the newborn's birth, the Contractor must send verifications of
      infant's demographic data to the LDSS, within five (5) days after
      knowledge of the birth. The

                                   APPENDIX H
                                October 1, 2004
                                      H-5

<PAGE>

      demographic data must include: the mother's name and CIN, the newborn's
      name and CIN (if newborn has a CIN), sex and the date of birth.

3.    In districts that use an Enrollment Broker, the Contractor shall not
      submit electronic enrollments of newborns to the Enrollment Broker, as
      this will interfere with the retroactive enrollment of the newborn back to
      the first (1st) day of the month of birth. For newborns whose mothers are
      not enrolled in the Contractor's plan and who were not pre-enrolled into
      the plan as an unborn, the Contractor may submit an electronic enrollment
      of the newborn to the Enrollment Broker. In such cases, the Effective Date
      of Enrollment will be prospective.

4.    In voluntary counties, the Contractor will accept applications for unborns
      if that is the mother's intent, even if the mother is not and/or will not
      be enrolled in the Contractor's plan. In all Counties when a mother is
      ineligible for enrollment or chooses not to enroll, the Contractor will
      accept applications for pre-enrollment of unborns who are eligible.

5.    The Contractor is responsible for provision of services to the newborn and
      payment of the hospital or birthing center bill, if the mother is an
      Enrollee at the time of the newborn's birth, even if the newborn is not
      yet on the Roster.

6.    The Contractor will reimburse the hospital or birthing center at the
      Medicaid rate (or at another rate if contractually agreed to between the
      Contractor and the hospital or birthing center) for this episode of care.
      Hospitals and birthing centers have been advised by SDOH to expeditiously
      bill MCOs to allow MCOs to arrange for care for the Enrollees. However,
      the Contractor may not deny the inpatient hospital or birthing center
      costs if billing/notification is not timely except as otherwise provided
      by contractual agreement by the Contractor and hospital or birthing
      center.

7.    Within fourteen (14) days of the date on which the Contractor becomes
      aware of the birth, the Contractor will issue a letter informing parent(s)
      about the newborn's enrollment and how to access care or a member
      identification card.

8.    In those cases in which the Contractor is aware of the pregnancy, the
      Contractor will ensure that enrolled pregnant women select a PCP for their
      infants prior to birth.

9.    The Contractor will ensure that the newborn is linked with a PCP prior to
      discharge from the hospital or birthing center, in those instances in
      which the Contractor has received appropriate notification of birth prior
      to discharge.

C. AUTO-ASSIGNMENT PROCESS (MANDATORY PROGRAM ONLY):

This section only applies to a LDSS where CMS has given approval and the LDSS
has begun mandatory enrollment. The details of the auto-assignment process are
contained in Section 12 of the State's Operational Protocol.

                                   APPENDIX H

                                       H-6

<PAGE>

SDOH RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    SDOH will provide information to LDSS on a daily basis of those
      individuals who have been added to the tickler file through the Potential
      Auto-Assign List.

2.    SDOH, LDSS or Enrollment Broker will assign eligible individuals not
      pre-coded in WMS as exempt or excluded, who have not chosen an MCO in the
      required time period to an MCO using an algorithm as specified in State
      Law SSL ss. 364-j(4)(d).

3.    SDOH will ensure the auto-assignment process automatically updates the PCP
      Subsystem, and will notify the MCO of auto-assigned individuals
      electronically.

4.    SDOH will notify the LDSS electronically on a daily basis of those
      individuals for whom the State has selected a health plan through the
      Automated PCP Update Report. Note: This will not apply in Local Districts
      that utilize an enrollment broker.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

1.    The LDSS is responsible for tracking an individual's choice period.

2.    The LDSS will use the information contained in the Potential Auto-Assign
      List for education and outreach purposes.

3.    The LDSS will send at least one reminder notice to individuals who fail to
      return the enrollment application within thirty (30) days. The LDSS may
      employ other methods during the choice period to encourage individuals to
      choose an MCO prior to auto-assignment.

4.    The LDSS is responsible for providing notification to individuals
      regarding their enrollment status as specified in Section A of this
      Appendix.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1)    The Contractor is also responsible for providing notification to
      individuals regarding their enrollment status as specified in Section A of
      this Appendix.

D. ROSTER RECONCILIATION:

All enrollments are effective the first of the month.

SDOH Responsibilities:

1)    The SDOH maintains both the PCP subsystem enrollment files and the WMS
      eligibility files, using data input by the LDSS. SDOH uses data contained
      in both these files to generate the Roster.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                October 1, 2004

<PAGE>

2)    SDOH shall send each MCO and LDSS monthly (according to a schedule
      established by SDOH), a complete list of all Enrollees for which the
      Contractor is expected to assume medical risk beginning on the 1st of the
      following month (First Monthly Roster). Notification to MCOs and LDSS will
      be accomplished via paper transmission, magnetic media, or the HPN.

3)    SDOH shall send each MCO and LDSS monthly, at the time of the first
      monthly roster production, a Disenrollment Report listing those Enrollees
      from the previous month's roster who were disenrolled, transferred to
      another MCO, or whose enrollments were deleted from the file. Notification
      to the MCOs and LDSSs will be accomplished via paper transmission,
      magnetic media, or the HPN.

4)    The SDOH shall also forward an error report as necessary to each MCO and
      LDSS.

5)    On the first (1st) weekend after the first (1st) day of the month
      following the generation of the first (1st) Roster, SDOH shall send MCOs
      and LDSS a second Roster which contains any additional Enrollees that the
      LDSS has added for enrollment for the current month. The SDOH will also
      include any additions to the error report that have occurred since the
      initial error report was generated.

LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

1)    LDSS must notify the Contractor electronically or in writing of changes in
      the First Roster and error report, no later than the end of the month.
      (Note: To the extent practicable the date specified must allow for timely
      notice to Enrollees regarding their enrollment status. MCOs and the LDSS
      may develop protocols for the purpose of resolving Roster discrepancies
      that remain unresolved beyond the end of the month. These protocols should
      be contained in Section G of this Appendix.)

2)    Enrollment and eligibility issues are reconciled by the LDSS to the extent
      possible, through manual adjustments to the PCP subsystem enrollment and
      WMS eligibility files, if appropriate.

MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

1)    The Contractor is at risk for providing Benefit Package services for those
      Enrollees listed on the 1st and 2nd rosters for the month in which the 2nd
      Roster is generated. Contractor is not at risk for providing services to
      Enrollees who appear on the monthly disenrollment report.

2)    The Contractor must submit claims to the State's Fiscal Agent for all
      Eligible Persons that are on the 1st and 2nd Rosters (see Appendix H, page
      7), adjusted to add Eligible Persons enrolled by the LDSS after Roster
      production and to remove individuals disenrolled by LDSS after Roster
      production (as notified to the Contractor). In the cases of retroactive
      disenrollments, the Contractor is responsible for submitting an adjustment
      to void any previously paid premiums for the period of retroactive
      disenrollment, where the Contractor was not at risk for the provision of
      Benefit

                                   APPENDIX H

      Package services. Payment of subcapitation does not constitute "provision
      of Benefit Package services."

E. DISENROLLMENT:

LDSS Responsibilities:

      1.    The LDSS will accept requests for disenrollment directly from
            Enrollees and may not require Enrollees to approach the MCO for a
            disenrollment form. Where an LDSS is authorized to mandate
            enrollment, all requests for disenrollment must be directed to the
            LDSS or the enrollment broker. LDSSs and the enrollment broker must
            utilize the State-approved Disenrollment forms.

      2.    Enrollees may initiate a request for an expedited disenrollment to
            the LDSS. The LDSS will expedite the disenrollment process in those
            cases where an Enrollee's request for disenrollment involves an
            urgent medical need, a complaint of non-consensual enrollment or,
            in New York City and other local districts where homeless
            individuals are exempt, homeless individuals in the shelter system.
            If approved, the LDSS will manually process the disenrollment
            through the PCP Subsystem.

      3.    The LDSS will process routine disenrollment requests to take effect
            on the first (1st) day of the following month if the request is made
            BEFORE the fifteenth (15th) day of the month. In no event shall the
            Effective Date of Disenrollment be later than the first (1st) day of
            the second month after the month in which an Enrollee requests a
            disenrollment.

      4.    The LDSS will disenroll Enrollees automatically upon death or loss
            of Medicaid eligibility. All such disenrollments will be effective
            at the end of the month in which the death or loss of eligibility
            occurs or at the end of the last month of guaranteed eligibility,
            where applicable.

      5.    In districts where the LDSS has the authority to operate a mandatory
            program, and in voluntary counties that enforce lock-in, the LDSS
            will disenroll Enrollees who request disenrollment upon
            determination that they meet good cause requirements as specified in
            Section 7.3 and 8.7 of this Agreement. The LDSS will provide
            Enrollees with notice of their right to request a fair hearing if
            their disenrollment request is denied. This notice must outline the
            reason(s) for the denial.

      6.    The LDSS will promptly disenroll an Enrollee whose managed care
            eligibility or health status changes such that he/she is deemed by
            the LDSS to meet the exclusion criteria. The LDSS will provide
            Enrollees with a notice of their right to request a fair hearing.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                October 1, 2004
                                      H-9

<PAGE>

      7.    In instances where an Enrollee requests disenrollment due to
            exclusion, the LDSS must notify the Enrollee of the approval or
            denial of exclusion/disenrollment status, including fair hearing
            rights if disenrollment is denied.

      8.    The LDSS agrees that retroactive disenrollments are to be used only
            when absolutely necessary. Circumstances warranting a retroactive
            disenrollment are rare and include when an individual is enrolled or
            autoassigned while meeting exclusion criteria or when an Enrollee
            enters or resides in a residential institution under circumstances
            which render the individual excluded from managed care; is
            incarcerated; is an SSI infant less than six (6) months of age; or
            dies - as long as the Contractor was not at risk for provision of
            Benefit Package services for any portion of the retroactive period.
            Payment of subcapitation does not constitute "provision of Benefit
            Package services." The LDSS must notify the Contractor of the
            retroactive disenrollment prior to the action. The LDSS must find
            out if the Contractor has made payments to providers on behalf of
            the Enrollee prior to disenrollment. After this information is
            obtained, the LDSS and Contractor will agree on a retroactive
            disenrollment or prospective disenrollment date.

            In all cases of retroactive disenrollment, including disenrollments
            effective the first day of the current month, the local district
            must notice the Contractor at the time of disenrollment, of the
            Contractor's responsibility to submit to the SDOH's Fiscal Agent
            voided premium claims for any full months of retroactive
            disenrollment where the Contractor was not at risk for the provision
            of Benefit Package services during the month. However, failure by
            the LDSS to so notify the Contractor does not affect the right of
            the SDOH to recover the premium payment as authorized by Section 3.6
            of this Agreement.

                                   APPENDIX H

      9.    Generally the effective dates of disenrollment are prospective.
            Effective dates for other than routine disenrollments are described
            below:

      which rendered the individual excluded from        classification of the stay as permanent,
      managed care, including when an Enrollee is        subsequent to entry(1)
      admitted to a hospital that 1) is certified
      by Medicare as a long-term care hospital and
      2) has an average length of stay for all
      patients greater than ninety-five (95) days
      as reported in the Statewide Planning and
      Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) Annual
      Report 2002.

</TABLE>

            (1)   Local districts shall make adjustments as necessary to allow a
            residential institution to be reimbursed by SDOH's Fiscal Agent for
            services provided by the residential institution if such stay is
            under circumstances which render the Enrollee excluded from managed
            care. However in such instances, if the Contractor was at risk for
            providing Benefit Package services to the Enrollee for a portion of
            the month, the Contractor is entitled to keep the capitation payment
            for the month.

            (2)   In counties outside of New York City, LDSSs should work
            together to ensure continuity of care through the Contractor if the
            Contractor's service area includes the county to which the Enrollee
            has moved and the Enrollee, with continuous eligibility, wishes to
            stay enrolled in the Contractor's plan.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                 October 1, 2004

            (3)   In New York City, Enrollees, not in guaranteed status, who
            move out of the Contractor's Service Area but not outside, of the
            City of New York (e.g., move from one borough to another), will not
            be involuntarily disenrolled, but must request a disenrollment or
            transfer. These disenrollments will be performed on a routine basis
            unless there is an urgent medical need to expedite the
            disenrollment.

      10.   The LDSS is responsible for informing Enrollees of their right to
            change MCOs including any applicable lock-in restrictions. For those
            LDSSs that have implemented a mandatory enrollment program, families
            or members of a case wishing to change MCOs will be required to do
            so as a unit, unless the LDSS determines a "good cause" reason to
            waive this requirement as specified in Section 6.6 (c) (i) of this
            Agreement.

      11.   The LDSS will render a decision within thirty (30) days of the
            receipt of a fully documented request for disenrollment, except for
            Contractor-initiated disenrollments where the LDSS decision must be
            made within fifteen (15) days as specified in Section 8.8 (g) of
            this Agreement.

      12.   The LDSS is responsible for sending the following notices to
            Enrollees regarding their disenrollment status. Where practicable,
            the process will allow for timely notification to Enrollees unless
            there is "good cause" to disenroll more expeditiously.

            a)    Notice of Disenrollment: These notices will advise the
                  Enrollee of the LDSS's determination regarding an
                  Enrollee-initiated, LDSS-initiated or Contractor-initiated
                  disenrollment and will include the Effective Date of
                  Disenrollment. In cases where the Enrollee is being
                  involuntarily disenrolled, the notice must contain fair
                  hearing rights.

            b)    When the LDSS denies any Enrollee's request for disenrollment
                  pursuant to Section 8 of the contract, the LDSS must inform
                  the Enrollee in writing explaining the reason for the denial,
                  stating the facts upon which the denial is based, citing the
                  statutory and regulatory authority and advising the Enrollee
                  of his/her right to a fair hearing pursuant to 18NYCRR Part
                  358.

            c)    End of Lock-In Notice: Where Lock-In provisions are enforced,
                  Enrollees must be notified sixty (60) days before the end of
                  their Lock-In Period.

            d)    Notice of Change to "Guarantee Coverage": This notice will
                  advise the Enrollee that his or her Medicaid coverage is
                  ending and how this affects his or her enrollment in Medicaid
                  managed care. This notice contains pertinent information
                  regarding "guaranteed eligibility" benefits and dates of
                  coverage. If an Enrollee is not eligible for guarantee, this
                  notice is not necessary.

                                   APPENDIX H
                                October 1, 2004

      13.   The LDSS may require that an individual that has been disenrolled at
            the request of the Contractor be returned to the Medicaid
            fee-for-service program.

      14.   In those instances where the LDSS approves the Contractor's request
            to disenroll an Enrollee, and the Enrollee requests a fair hearing,
            the Contractor will continue to keep the Enrollee In the plan until
            the disposition of the fair hearing, when Aid to Continue is ordered
            by OAH.

      15.   The LDSS will review each Contractor requested disenrollment in
            accordance with the provisions of Section 8.8 of this Agreement.
            Where applicable, the LDSS may consult with local mental health and
            substance abuse authorities in the district when making the
            determination to approve or disapprove the request.

      16.   The LDSS shall establish procedures whereby the Contractor refers
            cases which are appropriate for an LDSS-initiated disenrollment and
            submits supporting documentation to the LDSS.

      17.   After the LDSS receives and, if appropriate, approves the request
            for disenrollment either from the Enrollee or the Contractor, the
            LDSS will update the PCP subsystem file with an end date. MEVS and
            the Fiscal Agent are then updated to reflect the Enrollee's return
            to fee-for-service processing. The Enrollee is removed from the
            Contractor's Roster.

      MCO RESPONSIBILITIES:

      1.    In those instances where the Contractor directly receives
            disenrollment forms, the Contractor will forward these
            disenrollments to the LDSS for processing within five (5) business
            days (or according to Section F of this Appendix). During pulldown
            week, these forms may be faxed to the LDSS with the hard copy to
            follow.

      2.    The Contractor must accept and transmit all requests for voluntary
            disenrollments from its Enrollees to the LDSS, and shall not impose
            any barriers to disenrollment requests. The Contractor may require
            that a disenrollment request be in writing, contain the signature of
            the Enrollee, and state the Enrollee's correct MCO or Medicaid
            identification number.

      3.    Following LDSS procedures, the Contractor will refer cases which are
            appropriate for an LDSS-initiated disenrollment and will submit
            supporting documentation to the LDSS. This includes, but is not
            limited to, changes in status for its enrolled members that may
            impact eligibility for enrollment in an MCO such as address changes,
            incarceration, death, exclusion from managed care, etc.

      4.    With respect to Contractor-initiated disenrollments:

            a)    The Contractor may initiate an involuntary disenrollment if
                  the Enrollee engages in conduct or behavior that seriously
                  impairs the Contractor's ability

                                   APPENDIX H

<PAGE>

                  to furnish services to either the Enrollee or other
                  Enrollee's, provided that the Contractor has made and
                  documented reasonable efforts to resolve the problems
                  presented by the Enrollee.

            b)    The Contractor may not request disenrollment because of an
                  adverse change in the Enrollee's health status, or because of
                  the Enrollee's utilization of medical services, diminished
                  mental capacity, or uncooperative or disruptive behavior
                  resulting from the Enrollee's special needs (except where
                  continued enrollment in the Contractor's plan seriously
                  impairs the Contractor's ability to furnish services to either
                  the Enrollee or other Enrollees).

            c)    The Contractor must make a reasonable effort to identify for
                  the Enrollee, both verbally and in writing, those actions of
                  the Enrollee that have interfered with the effective provision
                  of covered services as well as explain what actions or
                  procedures are acceptable.

            d)    The Contractor shall give prior verbal and written notice to
                  the Enrollee, with a copy to the LDSS, of its intent to
                  request disenrollment. The written notice shall advise the
                  Enrollee that the request has been forwarded to the LDSS for
                  review and approval. The written notice must include the
                  mailing address and telephone number of the LDSS.

            e)    The Contractor shall keep the LDSS informed of decisions
                  related to all complaints filed by an Enrollee as a result of,
                  or subsequent to, the notice of intent to disenroll.

      5.    The Contractor will not consider an Enrollee disenrolled without
            confirmation from the LDSS or the Roster (as described in Section D
            of this Appendix).

      F. EXPEDITED DISENROLLMENTS

      Enrollees may request an expedited disenrollment if they have an urgent
      medical need to disenroll, if they were non-consensually enrolled in a
      managed care plan, or, if they are homeless and residing in the shelter
      system in New York City or other local districts where homeless
      individuals are exempt. Individuals who request to be disenrolled from
      managed care based on their documented HIV, ESRD, or SPMI/SED status are
      categorically eligible for an expedited disenrollment on the basis of
      urgent medical need.

      LDSS RESPONSIBILITIES:

      1.    The LDSS, to the extent possible, will process an expedited
            disenrollment within two business days of its determination that an
            expedited disenrollment is warranted. A disenrollment notice must be
            sent to the Enrollee outlining approval of the disenrollment
            request, including the Effective Date of Disenrollment.

                                   APPENDIX I

                                MEDICAL RESIDENTS

      (a)   Medical Residents as Primary Care Providers. MCOs may utilize
            medical residents as participants (but not designated as 'primary
            care providers') in the care of Enrollees as long as all of the
            following conditions are met:

            1)    Residents are a part of patient care teams headed by fully
                  licensed and MCO credentialed attending physicians serving
                  patients in one or more training sites in an "up weighted" or
                  "designated priority" residency program. Residents in a
                  training program which was disapproved as a designated
                  priority program solely due to the outcome measurement
                  requirement for graduates may be eligible to participate in
                  such patient care teams.

            2)    Only the attending physicians and nurse practitioners on the
                  training team, not residents, may be credentialed to the MCO
                  and may be empanelled with Enrollees. Enrollees must be
                  assigned an attending physician or certified nurse
                  practitioner to act as their PCP, though residents on the team
                  may perform all or many of the visits to the Enrollee as long
                  as the majority of these visits are under the direct
                  supervision of the Enrollee's designated PCP. Enrollees have
                  the right to request care by their PCP in addition or instead
                  of being seen by a resident.

            3)    Residents may work with attending physicians and certified
                  nurse practitioners to provide continuity of care to patients
                  under the supervision of the patient's PCP. Patients must be
                  made aware of the resident/attending relationship and be
                  informed of their rights to be cared for directly by their
                  PCP.

            4)    Residents eligible to be involved in a continuity relationship
                  with patients must be available at least 20% of the total
                  training time in the continuity of care setting and no less
                  than 10% of training time in any training year must be in the
                  continuity of care setting and no fewer than nine (9) months a
                  year must be spent in the continuity of care setting.

            5)    Residents meeting these criteria provide increased capacity
                  for enrollment to their team according to the following
                  formula:

                      PGY-1          300 per FTE
                      PGY-2          750 per FTE
                      PGY-3          1125 per FTE
                      PGY-4          1500 per FTE

                  Only hours spent routinely scheduled for patient care in the
                  continuity of care training site may count as providing
                  capacity and are based on 1.0 FTE = 40 hours.

                                   APPENDIX I
                                 October 1, 2004
                                       I-2

<PAGE>

      6)    In order for a resident to provide continuity of care to an
            Enrollee, both the resident and the attending PCP must have regular
            hours in the continuity site and must be scheduled to be in the site
            together the majority of the time.

      7)    A preceptor/attending is required to be present a minimum of sixteen
            (16) hours of combined precepting and direct patient care in the
            primary care setting to be counted as a team supervising PCP and
            accept an increased number of Enrollees based upon the residents
            working on his/her team. Time spent in patient care activities at
            other clinical sites or in other activities off-site is not counted
            towards this requirement.

      8)    A sixteen (16) hour per week attending may have no more than four
            (4) residents on their team. Attendings spending twenty-four (24)
            hours per week in patient care/supervisory activity at the
            continuity site could have six (6) residents per team. Attendings
            spending thirty-two (32) hours per week could have eight (8)
            residents on their team. Two (2) or more attendings may join
            together to form a larger team as long as the ratio of attending to
            residents does not exceed 1:4 and all attendings comply with the
            sixteen (16) hour minimum.

      9)    Specialty consults must be performed or directly supervised by a MCO
            credentialed specialist. The specialist may be assisted by a
            resident or fellow.

      10)   Responsibility for the care of the Enrollee remains with the
            attending physician. All attending/resident teams must provide
            adequate continuity of care, twenty-four (24) hour a day, seven (7)
            day a week coverage, and appointment and availability access.

      11)   Residents who do not qualify to act as continuity providers as part
            of an attending/resident team may still participate in the episodic
            care of Enrollees as long as that care is under the supervision of
            an attending physician credentialed to a MCO. Such residents would
            not add to the capacity of that attending to empanel Enrollees,
            however.

      12)   Certified nurse practitioners and registered physician's assistants
            may not act as attending preceptors for resident physicians.

(B) MEDICAL RESIDENTS as SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS

      (1)   Residents may participate in the specialty care of Medicaid managed
            care patients in all settings supervised by fully licensed and
            MCO/PHSP credentialed specialty attending physicians.

      (2)   Only the attending physicians, not residents or fellows, may be
            credentialed by the MCO. Each attending must be credentialed by each

                                   APPENDIX I
                                 October 1, 2004
                                       I-3

<PAGE>

            MCO with which they will participate. Residents may perform all or
            many of the clinical services for the Enrollee as long as these
            clinical services are under the supervision of an appropriately
            credentialed specialty physician. Even when residents are
            credentialed by their program in particular procedures, certifying
            their competence to perform and teach those procedures, the overall
            care of each Enrollee remains the responsibility of the supervising
            MCO-credentialed attending.

      (3)   It is understood that many Enrollees will identify a resident as
            their specialty provider but the responsibility for all clinical
            decision-making remains with the attending physician of record.

      (4)   Enrollees must be given the name of the responsible attending
            physician in writing and be told how they may contact their
            attending physician or covering physician, if needed. This allows
            Enrollees to assist in the communication between their primary care
            provider and specialty attending and enables them to reach the
            specialty attending if an emergency arises in the course of their
            care. Enrollees must be made aware of the resident/attending
            relationship and must have a right to be cared for directly by the
            responsible attending physician, if requested.

      (5)   Enrollees requiring ongoing specialty care must be cared for in a
            continuity of care setting. This requires the ability to make
            follow-up appointments with a particular resident/attending
            physician, or if that provider team is not available, with a member
            of the provider's coverage group in order to insure ongoing
            responsibility for the patient by his/her MCO credentialed
            specialist. The responsible specialist and his/her specialty
            coverage group must be identifiable to the patient as well as to the
            referring primary care provider.

      (6)   Attending specialists must be available for emergency consultation
            and care during non-clinic hours. Emergency coverage may be provided
            by residents under adequate supervision. The attending or a member
            of the attending's coverage group must be available for telephone
            and/or in-person consultation when necessary.

      (7)   All training programs participating in Medicaid managed care must be
            accredited by the appropriate academic accrediting agency.

      (8)   All sites in which residents train must produce legible (preferably
            typewritten) consultation reports. Reports must be transmitted such
            they are received in a time frame consistent with the clinical
            condition of the patient, the urgency of the problem and the need
            for follow-up by the primary care physician. At a minimum, reports
            should be transmitted so that they are received no later than two
            (2) weeks from the date of the specialty visit.

                                   APPENDIX I

                                       I-4

<PAGE>

      (9)   Written reports are required at the time of initial consultation and
            again with the receipt of all major significant diagnostic
            information or changes in therapy. In addition, specialists must
            promptly report to the referring primary care physician any
            significant findings or urgent changes in therapy which result from
            the specialty consultation.

All training sites must deliver the same standard of care to all patients
irrespective of payor. Training sites must integrate the care of Medicaid,
uninsured and private patients in the same settings.

                     GUIDELINES FOR MEDICAID MCO COMPLIANCE
                 WITH THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA)

1.    OBJECTIVES

Title II of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) provides that no qualified individual
with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from
participation in or denied access to the benefits of services, programs or
activities of a public entity, or be subject to discrimination by such an
entity. Public entities include State and local government and ADA and Section
504 requirements extend to all programs and services provided by State and local
government. Since Medicaid is a government program, health services provided
through Medicaid Managed Care must be accessible to all who qualify for the
program.

MCO responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are imposed under Title II and
Section 504 when, as a contractor in a Medicaid program, a plan is providing a
government service. If an individual provider under contract with the MCO is not
accessible, it is the responsibility of the MCO to make arrangements to assure
that alternative services are provided. The MCO may determine it is expedient to
make arrangements with other providers, or to describe reasonable alternative
means and methods to make these services accessible through its existing
contractors. The goals of compliance with ADA Title II requirements are to offer
a level of services that allows people with disabilities access to the program
in its entirety, and the ability to achieve the same health care results as any
program participant.

MCO responsibilities for compliance with the ADA are also imposed under Title
III when the MCO functions as a public accommodation providing services to
individuals (e.g. program areas and sites such as marketing, education, member
services, orientation, complaints and appeals). The goals of compliance with ADA
Title III requirements are to offer a level of services that allows people with
disabilities full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities or
accommodations that the entity provides for its customers or clients. New and
altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible. Whenever MCOs
engage in new construction or renovation, compliance is also required with
accessible design and construction standards promulgated pursuant to the ADA as
well as State and local laws. Title III also requires that public accommodations
undertake "readily achievable barrier removal" in existing facilities where
architectural and communications barriers can be removed easily and without much
difficulty or expense.

The state uses Plan Qualification Standards to qualify MCOs for participation in
the Medicaid Managed Care Program. Pursuant to the state's responsibility to
assure program access to all recipients, the Plan Qualification Standards
require each MCO to submit an ADA Compliance Plan that describes in detail how
the MCO will make services, programs and activities readily accessible and
useable by

                                   APPENDIX J
                                 October 1, 2004
                                       J-2

<PAGE>

individuals with disabilities. In the event that certain program sites are not
readily accessible, the MCO must describe reasonable alternative methods for
making the services or activities accessible and usable.

The objectives of these guidelines are threefold:

      -     to ensure that MCOs take appropriate steps to measure access and
            assure program accessibility for persons with disabilities;

      -     to provide a framework for managed care organizations (MCOs) as they
            develop a plan to assure compliance with the Americans with
            Disabilities Act (ADA); and

      -     to provide standards for the review of MCO Compliance Plans.

These guidelines include a general standard followed by a discussion of specific
considerations and suggestions of methods for assuring compliance. Please be
advised that, although these guidelines and any subsequent reviews by State and
local governments can give the contractor guidance, it is ultimately the
contractor's obligation to ensure that it complies with its contractual
obligations, as well as with the requirements of the ADA, Section 504, and other
federal, state and local laws. Other federal, state and local statutes and
regulations also prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability and may
impose requirements in addition to those established under ADA. For example,
while the ADA covers those impairments that "substantially" limit one or more of
the major life activities of an individual, New York City Human Rights Law
deletes the modifier "substantially".

III.  SCOPE OF MCO COMPLIANCE PLAN

The MCO Compliance Plan must address accessibility to services at the MCO's
program sites, including both participating provider sites and MCO facilities
intended for use by enrollee.

IV.   PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY

Public programs and services, when viewed in their entirety, must be readily
accessible to and useable by individuals with disabilities. This standard
includes physical access, non-discrimination in policies and procedures and
communication. Communications with individuals with disabilities are required to
be as effective as communications with others. The MCO Compliance Plan must
include a detailed description of how MCO services, programs and activities are
readily accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. In the event
that full physical accessibility is not readily available for people with
disabilities, the MCO Compliance Plan will describe the steps or actions the MCO
will take to assure accessibility to services equivalent to those offered at the
inaccessible facilities.

IV    PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY

A.    PRE-ENROLLMENT MARKETING AND EDUCATION

V.    ADDITIONAL ADA RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS

Please note that Title III of the ADA applies to all non-governmental providers
of health care. Title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of
goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages or accommodations of any
place of public accommodation. A public accommodation is a private entity that
owns, leases or leases to, or operates a place of public accommodation. Places
of public accommodation identified by the ADA include, but are not limited to,
stores (including pharmacies), offices (including doctors' offices), hospitals,
health care providers, and social service centers.

New and altered areas and facilities must be as accessible as possible. Barriers
must be removed from existing facilities when it is readily achievable, defined
by the ADA as easily accomplishable without much difficulty or expense. Factors
to be considered when determining if barrier removal is readily achievable
include the cost of the action, the financial resources of the site involved,
and, if applicable, the overall financial resources of any parent corporation or
entity. If barrier removal is not readily achievable, the ADA requires alternate
methods of making goods and services available. New facilities must be
accessible unless structurally impracticable.

Title III also requires places of public accommodation to provide any auxiliary
aids and services that are needed to ensure equal access to the services it
offers, unless a fundamental alteration in the nature of services or an undue
burden would result. Auxiliary aids include but

                                   APPENDIX J
                                 October 1, 2004
                                      J-13

<PAGE>

are not limited to qualified sign interpreters, assistive listening systems,
readers, large print materials, etc. Undue burden is defined as "significant
difficulty or expense". The factors to be considered in determining "undue
burden" include, but are not limited to, the nature and cost of the action
required and the overall financial resources of the provider. "Undue burden" is
a higher standard than "readily achievable" in that it requires a greater level
of effort on the part of the public accommodation.

Please note also that the ADA is not the only law applicable for people with
disabilities. In some cases, State or local laws require more than the ADA. For
example, New York City's Human Rights Law, which also prohibits discrimination
against people with disabilities, includes people whose impairments are not as
"substantial" as the narrower ADA and uses the higher "undue burden"
("reasonable") standard where the ADA requires only that which is "readily
achievable". New York City's Building Code does not permit access waivers for
newly constructed facilities and requires incorporation of access features as
existing facilities are renovated. Finally, the State Hospital code sets a
higher standard than the ADA for provision of communication (such as sign
language interpreters) for services provided at most hospitals, even on an
outpatient basis.

      a. Non-Emergency Transportation

      Transportation expenses are covered when transportation is essential in
      order for an Enrollee to obtain necessary medical care and services which
      are covered under the Medicaid program (either as part of the Contractor's
      Benefit Package or by fee-for-service Medicaid). Non-emergent
      transportation guidelines may be developed in conjunction with the LDSS,
      based on the LDSS' approved transportation plan.

      Transportation services means transportation by ambulance, ambulette fixed
      wing or airplane transport, invalid coach, taxicab, livery, public
      transportation, or other means appropriate to the Enrollee's medical
      condition; and a transportation attendant to accompany the Enrollee, if
      necessary. Such services may include the transportation attendant's
      transportation, meals, lodging and salary; however, no salary will be paid
      to a transportation attendant who is a member of the Enrollee's family.

      When the Contractor is capitated for non-emergency transportation, the
      Contractor is also responsible for providing transportation to Medicaid
      covered services that are not part of the Contractor's Benefit Package.

      For Contractors that cover non-emergency transportation in the Benefit
      Package, transportation costs to MMTP services may be reimbursed by
      Medicaid fee-for-service in accordance with the LDSS transportation
      polices in local districts where there is a systematic method to
      discretely identify and reimburse such transportation costs.

      For Enrollees with disabilities, the method of transportation must
      reasonably accommodate their needs, taking into account the severity and
      nature of the disability.

      b. Emergency Transportation

      Emergency transportation can only be provided by an ambulance service
      including air ambulance service. Emergency ambulance transportation means
      the provision of ambulance transportation for the purpose of obtaining
      hospital services for an Enrollee who suffers from severe,
      life-threatening or potentially disabling conditions which require the
      provision of emergency medical services while the Enrollee is being
      transported.

      Emergency medical services means the provision of initial urgent medical
      care including, but not limited to, the treatment of trauma, burns,
      respiratory, circulatory and obstetrical emergencies.

      Emergency ambulance transportation is transportation to a hospital
      emergency room generated by a "Dial 911" emergency system call or some
      other request for an immediate response to a medical emergency. Because of
      the urgency of the transportation request, insurance coverage or other
      billing provisions are not addressed until after the trip is completed.
      When the Contractor is capitated for this benefit, emergency
      transportation via 911 or any other emergency call system is a covered
      benefit and the Contractor is responsible for payment.

                    III. DEFINITIONS OF NON-COVERED SERVICES

The following services are excluded from the Contractor's Benefit Package, but
are covered, in most instances, by Medicaid fee-for-service:

A.    MEDICAL NON-COVERED SERVICES

1.    PERSONAL CARE AGENCY SERVICES

Personal care services (PCS) are the provision of some or total assistance with
personal hygiene, dressing and feeding; and nutritional and environmental
support (meal preparation and housekeeping). Such services must be essential to
the maintenance of the Enrollee's health and safety in his or her own home. The
service has to be ordered by a physician, and there has to be a medical need for
the service. Licensed home care services agencies, as opposed to certified home
health agencies, are the primary providers of PCS. Enrollee's receiving PCS have
to have a stable medical condition and are generally expected to be in receipt
of such services for an extended period of time (years).

Services rendered by a personal care agency which are approved by the LDSS are
not covered under the Benefit Package. Should it be medically necessary for the
PCP to order personal care agency services, the PCP (or the Contractor on the
physician's behalf) must first contact the Enrollee's LDSS contact person for
personal care. The district will determine the Enrollee's need for personal care
