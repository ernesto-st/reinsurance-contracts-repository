     Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all accounting terms used
herein shall be interpreted, and all financial statements and certificates and
reports as to financial matters required to be delivered to the Lenders
hereunder shall be prepared, in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent

however, if (a) the Borrower shall object to determining such compliance on such
-------
basis at the time of delivery of such financial statements due to any change in
GAAP or the rules promulgated with respect thereto or (b) the Agent or the
Required Lenders shall so object in writing within 60 days after delivery of

                                CREDIT FACILITIES

     2.1  Revolving Loans.
          ---------------

          (a) Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in
              ----------
     reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein, each
     Lender severally agrees to make available to the Borrower such Lender's
     Commitment Percentage of the revolving credit loans requested by the
     Borrower in Dollars (the "Revolving Loans") from time to time from the
                               ---------------
     Closing Date until the Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the
     Commitments shall have been terminated as provided herein for the purposes
     hereinafter set forth; provided, however, that (i) with regard to each
                            --------  -------
     Lender individually, such Lender's share of outstanding Revolving Loans and
     Swingline Loans and LOC

                                       27

<PAGE>

     Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's Commitment Percentage of the
     Commitment Amount, and (ii) with regard to the Lenders collectively, the
     aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans
     and LOC Obligations shall not exceed the Revolving Committed Amount.

     Revolving Loans may consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a
     combination thereof, as the Borrower may request, and may be repaid and
     reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof; provided, however,
                                                          --------  -------
     that no more than ten (10) Eurodollar Loans shall be outstanding hereunder
     at any time. For purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest
     Periods shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they
     begin on the same date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions
     may, in accordance with the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of
     existing Interest Periods to constitute a new single Eurodollar Loan with a
     single Interest Period.

          (b)  Revolving Loan Borrowings.
               -------------------------

               (i)   Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall request a Revolving
                     -------------------
     Loan borrowing by written notice (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed
     in writing) to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (Charlotte, North
     Carolina time) on the Business Day prior to the date of the requested
     borrowing in the case of Base Rate Loans, and on the third Business Day
     prior to the date of the requested borrowing in the case of Eurodollar
     Loans. Each such request for borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall
     specify (A) that a Revolving Loan is requested, (B) the date of the
     requested borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the aggregate
     principal amount to be borrowed, and (D) whether the borrowing shall be
     comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Loans or a combination thereof,
     and if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor. If
     the Borrower shall fail to specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an
     applicable Interest Period in the case of a Eurodollar Loan, then such
     notice shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one month,
     or (II) the type of Revolving Loan requested, then such notice shall be
     deemed to be a request for a Base Rate Loan hereunder. The Agent shall give
     notice to each affected Lender promptly upon receipt of each Notice of
     Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the contents thereof and each
     such Lender's share of any borrowing to be made pursuant thereto.

               (ii)  Minimum Amounts. Each Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan
                     ---------------
     that is a Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount
     of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof (or the
     remaining amount of the Revolving Committed Amount, if less).

               (iii) Advances. Each Lender will make its Commitment Percentage
                     --------
     of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Agent for the account of
     the Borrower as specified in Section 3.15(a), or in such other manner as
     the Agent may specify in writing, by 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
     time) on the date specified in the applicable Notice of Borrowing in
     Dollars and in funds immediately available to the Agent. Such borrowing
     will then be made available to the Borrower by the Agent by crediting the
     account of the Borrower on the books of such office with the aggregate of
     the amounts made available to the Agent by the Lender.

                                       28

          (c)  Repayment. The principal amount of all Revolving Loans shall be
               ---------

               --------

               (i)  Base Rate Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
                    ---------------
          shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans, such Base
          Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
          Adjusted Base Rate.

               (ii) Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as Revolving Loans
                    ----------------
          shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar Loans, such
          Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
          Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

     Interest on Revolving Loans shall be payable in arrears on each applicable
     Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be specified herein).

          (e)  Revolving Notes. Any Lender may request that Revolving Loans made
               ---------------
     by it be evidenced by a duly executed promissory note of the Borrower to
     such Lender in an original principal amount equal to such Lender's
     Commitment Percentage of the Committed Amount and in substantially the form
     of Exhibit 2.1(e), with appropriate insertions as to date and principal
        --------------
     amount (each such promissory note a "Revolving Note").
                                          --------------

     2.2  Letter of Credit Subfacility.
          ----------------------------

          (a)  Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and of the
               --------
     LOC Documents, if any, and any other terms and conditions which the Issuing
     Lender may reasonably require and in reliance upon the representations and
     warranties set forth herein, the Issuing Lender agrees to issue, and each
     Lender severally agrees to participate in the issuance by the Issuing
     Lender of, standby Letters of Credit in Dollars from time to time from the
     Closing Date until the Maturity Date as the Borrower may request, in a form
     acceptable to the Issuing Lender; provided, however, that (i) the LOC
                                       --------  -------
     Obligations outstanding shall not at any time exceed TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS
     ($20,000,000) (the "LOC Committed Amount"); (ii) with regard to each Lender
                         --------------------
     individually, such Lender's share of outstanding Revolving Loans and
     Swingline Loans and LOC Obligations shall not exceed such Lender's
     Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount; and (iii) with
     regard to the Lenders collectively, the aggregate principal amount of
     outstanding Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and LOC Obligations shall not
     exceed the Revolving Committed Amount. No Letter of Credit shall (x) have
     an original expiry date more than one year from the date of issuance or (y)
     as originally issued or as extended, have an expiry date extending beyond
     the date five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. Each Letter of
     Credit shall comply with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry
     dates of each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day.

          (b)  Notice and Reports. The request for the issuance of a Letter of
               ------------------
     Credit shall be submitted by the Borrower to the Issuing Lender at least
     three (3) Business Days

                                       29

<PAGE>

     prior to the requested date of issuance. The Issuing Lender will, at least
     quarterly and more frequently upon request, deliver to each of the Lenders,
     with a copy to the Borrower, a detailed report specifying the Letters of
     Credit which are then issued and outstanding and any activity with respect
     thereto which may have occurred since the date of the prior report, and
     including therein, among other things, the beneficiary, the face amount and
     the expiry date, as well as any payment or expirations which may have
     occurred.

          (c)  Participation. Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of Credit
               -------------
     (or, in the case of each Existing Letter of Credit, on the Closing Date),
     shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a Participation Interest
     from the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and the obligations
     arising thereunder and any collateral relating thereto, in each case in an
     amount equal to its pro rata share of the obligations under such Letter of
     Credit (based on the respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders) and
     shall absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be obligated
     to pay to the Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata share of
     the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit. Without limiting the
     scope and nature of each Lender's Participation Interest in any Letter of
     Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as
     required hereunder or under any such Letter of Credit, each such Lender
     shall pay to the Issuing Lender its pro rata share of such unreimbursed
     drawing in same day funds on the day of notification by the Issuing Lender
     of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d)
     below. The obligation of each Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender
     shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by the
     occurrence of a Default, an Event of Default or any other occurrence or
     event. Any such reimbursement shall not relieve or otherwise impair the
     obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the Issuing Lender under any Letter
     of Credit, together with interest as hereinafter provided.

          (d)  Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
               -------------
     Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower. Unless the
     Borrower shall immediately notify the Issuing Lender that the Borrower
     intends to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender for such drawing, the
     Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that the Lenders make a
     Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing as provided in subsection (e)
     below on the related Letter of Credit, the proceeds of which will be used
     to satisfy the related reimbursement obligations. The Borrower promises to
     reimburse the Issuing Lender on the day of drawing under any Letter of
     Credit (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or
     otherwise) in same day funds. If the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the
     Issuing Lender as provided hereinabove, the Borrower promises to pay the
     Issuing Lender interest on the unreimbursed amount of such drawing on
     demand at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%. The
     Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder shall be absolute and
     unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any rights of setoff,
     counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower may claim or have against
     the Issuing Lender, the Agent, the Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter
     of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including without limitation any
     defense based on any failure of the Borrower or any other Credit Party to
     receive consideration or the legality, validity, regularity or
     unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing Lender will promptly
     notify the other Lenders of the amount of any unreimbursed drawing and each
     Lender shall promptly pay to the Agent for the

                                       30

<PAGE>

     account of the Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately available
     funds, the amount of such Lender's pro rata share of such unreimbursed
     drawing. Such payment shall be made on the day such notice is received by
     such Lender from the Issuing Lender if such notice is received at or before
     2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) otherwise such payment shall be
     made at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the
     Business Day next succeeding the day such notice is received. If such
     Lender does not pay such amount to the Issuing Lender in full upon such
     request, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Agent for the account of
     the Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period from the
     date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the Issuing
     Lender in full at a rate per annum equal to, if paid within two (2)
     Business Days of the date that such Lender is required to make payments of
     such amount pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Federal Funds Rate and
     thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation to
     make such payment to the Issuing Lender, and the right of the Issuing
     Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not
     be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the
     termination of this Credit Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the
     existence of a Default or Event of Default or the acceleration of the
     obligations of the Borrower hereunder and shall be made without any offset,
     abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Simultaneously with the
     making of each such payment by a Lender to the Issuing Lender, such Lender
     shall, automatically and without any further action on the part of the
     Issuing Lender or such Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an
     amount equal to such payment (excluding the portion of such payment
     constituting interest owing to the Issuing Lender) in the related
     unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest
     thereon and in the related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against
     the Borrower with respect thereto.

          (e)  Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which the Borrower
               ------------------------------
     shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a Revolving Loan
     advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Agent shall
     give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been requested or
     deemed requested by the Borrower to be made in connection with a drawing
     under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan advance comprised
     of Base Rate Loans (or Eurodollar Loans to the extent the Borrower has
     complied with the procedures of Section 2.1(b)(i) with respect thereto)
     shall be immediately made to the Borrower by all Lenders (notwithstanding
     any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) pro rata based
                                                                 --- ----
     on the respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before
     giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section
     9.2) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Issuing Lender
     for application to the respective LOC Obligations. Each such Lender hereby
     irrevocably agrees to make its pro rata share of each such Revolving Loan
     immediately upon any such request or deemed request in the amount, in the
     manner and on the date specified in the preceding sentence notwithstanding
                                                                ---------------
     (i) the amount of such borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for
     advances of Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any
     conditions specified in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a
     Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such
     request or deemed request for Revolving Loan to be made by the time
     otherwise required hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is a
     date on which Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder
     or (vi) any termination of the Commitments relating thereto immediately
     prior to or

                                       31

<PAGE>

     contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that any Revolving Loan
     cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise required above
     (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a
     proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower or any
     Credit Party), then each such Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith
     purchase (as of the date such borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but
     adjusted for any payments received from the Borrower on or after such date
     and prior to such purchase) from the Issuing Lender such Participation
     Interests in the outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause
     each such Lender to share in such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the
     respective Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before giving
     effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2)),
     provided that at the time any purchase of Participation Interests pursuant
     --------
     to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required
     to pay to the Issuing Lender, to the extent not paid to the Issuing Lender
     by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of subsection (d) above,
     interest on the principal amount of Participation Interests purchased for
     each day from and including the day upon which such borrowing would
     otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such
     Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
     Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan advance, the Federal Funds
     Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate.

          (f)  Renewal, Extension. The renewal or extension of any Letter of
               ------------------
     Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as
     the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

          (g)  Uniform Customs and Practices. Unless otherwise expressly agreed
               -----------------------------
     by the Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued
     (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit),
     (i) the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published by
     the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later
     version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to
     each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs
     and Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the
     International Chamber of Commerce (the "ICC") at the time of issuance
                                             ---
     (including the ICC decision published by the Commission on Banking
     Technique and Practice on April 6, 1998 regarding the European single
     currency (euro)) shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.

          (h)  Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.
               --------------------------------------------------

               (i)  In addition to its other obligations under this Section 2.2,
          the Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify and save
          each Lender harmless from and against, any and all claims, demands,
          liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including
          reasonable attorneys' fees) that such Lender may incur or be subject
          to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of any
          Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of the Issuing Lender to honor a
          drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or omission,
          whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de
          facto government or Governmental Authority (all such acts or
          omissions, herein called "Government Acts").
                                    ---------------

                                       32

<PAGE>

               (ii)  As between the Borrower and the Lenders (including the
          Issuing Lender), the Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts,
          omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary
          thereof. No Lender (including the Issuing Lender) shall be
          responsible: (A) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy,
          genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in
          connection with the application for and issuance of any Letter of
          Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects
          invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the
          validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
          purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or
          benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may
          prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors,
          omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
          messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or
          not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in the transmission
          or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under
          a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (E) for any
          consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Lender,
          including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above
          shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender's
          rights or powers hereunder.

               (iii) In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
          specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted
          by any Lender (including the Issuing Lender), under or in connection
          with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or
          omitted in good faith, shall not put such Lender under any resulting
          liability to the Borrower or any other Credit Party. It is the
          intention of the parties that this Credit Agreement shall be construed
          and applied to protect and indemnify each Lender (including the
          Issuing Lender) against any and all risks involved in the issuance of
          the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are hereby assumed by the
          Borrower (on behalf of itself and each of the other Credit Parties),
          including, without limitation, any and all Government Acts. No Lender
          (including the Issuing Lender) shall, in any way, be liable for any
          failure by such Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any
          Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other cause
          beyond the control of such Lender.

               (iv)  Nothing in this subsection (h) is intended to limit the
          reimbursement obligations of the Borrower contained in subsection (d)
          above. The obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (h) shall
          survive the termination of this Credit Agreement. No act or omissions
          of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any
          way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders (including the Issuing
          Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Credit
          Agreement.

               (v)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
          subsection (h), the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify any
          Lender (including the Issuing Lender) in respect of any liability
          incurred by such Lender (A) arising solely out of the gross negligence
          or willful misconduct of such Lender, as determined by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, or (B) caused by such

                                       33

<PAGE>

          Lender's failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation
          to it of a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of
          such Letter of Credit, as determined by a court of competent
          jurisdiction, unless such payment is prohibited by any law,
          regulation, court order or decree.

          (i)  Responsibility of Issuing Lender. It is expressly understood and
               --------------------------------
     agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder to the Lenders
     are only those expressly set forth in this Credit Agreement; provided,
                                                                  --------
     however, that nothing set forth in this Section 2.2 shall be deemed to
     -------
     prejudice the right of any Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any
     amounts made available by such Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to
     this Section 2.2 in the event that it is determined by a court of competent
     jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit
     constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
     Issuing Lender.

          (j)  Limitation on Obligation of the Issuing Lender. Notwithstanding
               ----------------------------------------------
     anything contained herein to the contrary, the Issuing Lender shall not be
     under any obligation to issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit if any
     order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall
     by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Lender from issuing
     a Letter of Credit, or any applicable law, rule or regulation or any
     request or directive (having the force of law) from any governmental
     authority with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or
     request that the Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of
     credit generally or any such Letter of Credit in particular, or shall
     impose upon the Issuing Lender with respect to any such Letter of Credit
     any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the Issuing
     Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing
     Date, or shall impose upon the Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, costs
     or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which the
     Issuing Lender should deem material to it in good faith.

          (k)  Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict between
               ---------------------------
     this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including any letter of credit
     application), this Credit Agreement shall control as among the parties
     hereto.

                                                               ----
     Obligations plus obligations in respect of Swingline Loans outstanding at
     any time shall not exceed the aggregate Revolving Committed Amount.
     Swingline Loans hereunder shall be made as a Base Rate Loan in accordance
     with the provisions of this Section 2.3, and may be repaid and reborrowed
     in accordance with the provisions hereof.

          (b)  Swingline Loan Advances.
               -----------------------

               (i)    Notices; Disbursement. Whenever the Borrower desires a
                      ---------------------
          Swingline Loan advance hereunder, the Borrower shall give written
          notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the
          Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
          time) on the Business Day of the requested Swingline Loan advance.
          Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify (A) that a
          Swingline Loan advance is requested, (B) the date of the requested
          Swingline Loan advance (which shall be a Business Day) and (C) the
          principal amount of the Swingline Loan advance requested. Each
          Swingline Loan shall be made as a Base Rate Loan and shall have such
          maturity date as set forth in clause (iii) below. The Swingline Lender
          shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by 3:00 P.M.,
          (Charlotte, North Carolina time), on the Business Day of the requested
          Borrowing.

               (ii)   Minimum Amount. Each Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum
                      --------------
          principal amount of $1,000,000 and in integral multiples of $100,000
          in excess thereof (or the remaining amount of the Swingline Committed
          Amount, if less).

               (iii)  Repayment of Swingline Loans. The principal amount of all
                      ----------------------------
          Swingline Loans shall be due and payable on the earlier of (A) a date
          that is seven (7) Business Days from the date of advance thereof or
          (B) the Maturity Date. The Swingline Lender may, at any time, in its
          sole discretion, by written notice to the Borrower and the Lenders,
          demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by way of a Revolving Loan
          advance, in which case the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested
          a Revolving Loan advance comprised solely of Base Rate Loans in the
          amount of such Swingline Loans; provided, however, that any such
                                          --------  -------
          demand shall be deemed to have been given one Business Day prior to
          the Maturity Date and on the date of the occurrence of any Event of
          Default described in Section 9.1 and upon acceleration of the
          Indebtedness hereunder and the exercise of remedies in accordance with
          the provisions of Section 9.2. Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees
          to make its pro rata share of each such Revolving Loan in the amount,
          in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding sentence
          notwithstanding (A) the amount of such borrowing may not comply with
          ---------------
          the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans otherwise required
          hereunder, (B) whether any conditions specified in Section 5.2 are
          then satisfied, (C) whether a Default or Event of Default then exists,
          (D) failure of any such request or deemed request for Revolving Loan
          to be made by the time otherwise required hereunder, (E) whether the
          date of such borrowing is a date on which Revolving Loans are
          otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (F) any termination of the
          Commitments relating thereto immediately prior to or contemporaneously
          with such borrowing. In the event that any Revolving Loan cannot for
          any reason be made on the date otherwise required above (including,
          without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding
          under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower), then each
          Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date
          such borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any
          payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to
          such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such

                                       35

<PAGE>

          participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be
          necessary to cause each such Lender to share in such Swingline Loans
          ratably based upon its Commitment Percentage of the Revolving
          Committed Amount, provided that (A) all interest payable on the
                            --------
          Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until
          the date as of which the respective participation is purchased and (B)
          at the time any purchase of participations pursuant to this sentence
          is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay to
          the Swingline Lender in accordance with the terms of subsection
          (c)(ii) hereof, interest on the principal amount of participation
          purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such
          borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of
          payment for such participation, at the rate equal to the Federal Funds
          Rate.

          (c)  Interest on Swingline Loans.
               ---------------------------

               (i)  Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1, each Swingline
          Loan shall bear interest at the rate per annum equal to the Adjusted
          Base Rate in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3(b).

               (ii) Interest on Swingline Loans shall be payable in arrears on
          each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may
          be specified herein).

               (d)  Swingline Note. The Swingline Lender may request that
                    --------------
          Swingline Loans made by it be evidenced by a duly executed promissory
          note of the Borrower to the Swingline Lender in an original principal
          amount equal to the Swingline Lender's Commitment Percentage.

     Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of Default,
(i) the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, accrued and unpaid
interest on the Revolving Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under
the other Credit Documents shall bear interest, payable on demand, at a per
annum rate 2% greater than the rate which would otherwise be applicable (or if
no rate is applicable, whether in respect of interest, fees or other amounts,
then the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%) and (ii) the Letter of Credit Fee shall
                            ----
accrue at a per annum rate 2% greater than the rate which would otherwise be
applicable.

          ------------------------

     Subject to the terms of Section 5.2, the Borrower shall have the option, on
any Business Day, to extend existing Revolving Loans into a subsequent
permissible Interest Period or to convert Revolving Loans into Revolving Loans
of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as provided in
                               --------  -------
Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Eurodollar Loans may be

                                       36

<PAGE>

extended, and Base Rate Loans may be converted into Eurodollar Loans, only if no
Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of extension or
conversion, (iii) Revolving Loans extended as, or converted into, Eurodollar
Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition of "Interest Period" set
                                                          ---------------
forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum amounts as provided in, with
respect to Revolving Loans, Section 2.1(b)(ii), (iv) no more than 10 Eurodollar
Loans shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood that, for
purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall be
considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same date,
although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance with the
provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to
constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period), (v) any request
for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan which shall fail to specify an
Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one
month and (vi) Swingline Loans may not be extended or converted pursuant to this
Section 3.2. Each such extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower
by giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion (or telephonic notice promptly
confirmed in writing) to the office of the Agent specified in Section 11.1, or
at such other office as the Agent may designate in writing, prior to 11:00 A.M.

conversion of a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the date of the proposed
extension or conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or
conversion, the Revolving Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of
Revolving Loans into which such Revolving Loans are to be converted and, if
appropriate, the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. Each request
for extension or conversion shall be irrevocable and shall constitute a
representation and warranty by the Borrower of the matters specified in
subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Section 5.2. In the event the Borrower
fails to request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan in accordance
with this Section, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or
required by this Section, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically
converted into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto. The Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of
any such proposed extension or conversion affecting any Revolving Loan.

     3.3  Prepayments.
          -----------

          (a)  Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the right to

     however, that each partial prepayment of Revolving Loans (other than
     -------
     Swingline Loans) shall be in a minimum principal amount of $2,000,000 and
     integral multiples of $500,000. Prepayment upon the Revolving Loans shall
     be made first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct
     order of Interest Period maturities.

          (b)  Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time, the sum of the
               --------------------------
     aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Loans plus Swingline
                                                               ----
     Loans plus LOC Obligations outstanding shall exceed the Revolving Committed
           ----
     Amount, the Borrower immediately shall prepay the Revolving Loans and
     (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid) cash collateralize the LOC
     Obligations, in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.

                                       37

<PAGE>

          (c)  Generally. Within the parameters of the applications set forth

     excess thereof (or, if less, the full remaining amount of the then
     applicable Revolving Committed Amount)) upon three Business Days' prior
     written notice to the Agent; provided, however, no such termination or
                                  --------  -------
     reduction shall be made which would cause the aggregate principal amount of
     outstanding Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and LOC Obligations to exceed
     the Revolving Committed Amount, unless, concurrently with such termination
     or reduction, the Revolving Loans are repaid to the extent necessary to
     eliminate such excess. The Agent shall promptly notify each affected Lender
     of receipt by the Agent of any notice from the Borrower pursuant to this
     Section 3.4(a).

          (b)  Maturity Date. The Commitments of the Lenders, the Swingline

     If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the adoption or
the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof in the interpretation or administration of, any
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or compliance by
such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for
such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from
such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this
Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto.

     3.7  Limitation on Eurodollar Loans.
          ------------------------------

     If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar
Loan:

                                       39

<PAGE>

          (a)  the Agent reasonably determines (which determination shall be
     conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market,
     adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar
     Rate for such Interest Period; or

          (b)  the Required Lenders reasonably determine (which determination
     shall be conclusive) and notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will not
     adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Eurodollar
     Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to
make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either
prepay such Eurodollar Loans or convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.

     3.8  Illegality.
          ----------

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, in the event
that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to
make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lender's obligation to make or
Continue Eurodollar Loans and to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and
fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable).

     3.9  Requirements of Law.
          -------------------

     (a)  If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule,
or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

              (i)  shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office)
     to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, its
     Revolving Notes, if any, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or
     change the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender (or its
     Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or its Revolving
     Notes, if any, in respect of any Eurodollar Loans (other than taxes imposed
     on the overall net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such
     Lender has its principal office or such Applicable Lending Office);

              (ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve,
     special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the
     Eurodollar Reserve Requirement utilized in the determination of the
     Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other
     assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities or

                                       40

<PAGE>

         commitments of, such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office),
         including the Commitment of such Lender hereunder; or

                      (iii) shall impose on such Lender (or its Applicable
         Lending Office) or on the United States market for certificates of
         deposit or the London interbank market any other condition affecting
         this Credit Agreement or its Revolving Notes, if any, or any of such
         extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, converting into, continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or
its Revolving Notes, if any, with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the
Borrower shall pay to such Lender on demand such amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender
requests compensation by the Borrower under this Section 3.9(a), the Borrower
may, by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), suspend the obligation
of such Lender to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to convert Base Rate
Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such
request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10
shall be applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right
                      --------
of such Lender to receive the compensation so requested.

         (b)      Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent
of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which
will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming
compensation under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the Borrower and the Agent
a statement setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it
hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

         3.10     Treatment of Affected Revolving Loans.
                  -------------------------------------

         If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
continue, or to convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
shall be automatically converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s) of the
then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of a
conversion required by Section 3.8 hereof, on such earlier date as such Lender
may specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such
Lender gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in
Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to such conversion no longer exist:

                  (a) to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans have
         been so converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would
         otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be applied
         instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

                  (b) all Revolving Loans that would otherwise be made or
         continued by such Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or continued
         instead as Base Rate Loans, and

                                       41

<PAGE>

         all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be converted
         into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to the
conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 3.10 no
longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances
ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are
outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Revolving Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by such
Lender are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

         3.11     Taxes.
                  -----

                  (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account
         of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document
         shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all
         present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges
         or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding,
                                                                    ---------
         in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income,
         and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws
         of which such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the Agent
         (as the case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof
         (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
         charges, withholdings, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as
         "Taxes"). If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes
          -----
         from or in respect of any sum payable under this Credit Agreement or
         any other Credit Document to any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum
         payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
         required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
         payable under this Section 3.11) such Lender or the Agent receives an
         amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions
         been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the
         Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation
         authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law, and
         (iv) the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred
         to in Section 11.1, the original or a certified copy of a receipt
         evidencing payment thereof.

                  (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all
         present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
         property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any
         payment made under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document
         or from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to,
         this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document (hereinafter
         referred to as "Other Taxes").
                         -----------

                  (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Agent
         for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
         limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any
         jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.11) paid by such
         Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
         penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
         thereto.

                                       42

<PAGE>

                  (d) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
         outside the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and
         delivery of this Credit Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on
         the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it
         becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to
         time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower or the Agent
         (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall
         provide the Borrower and the Agent with (i) Internal Revenue Service
         Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed
         by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender is
         entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United
         States is a party which reduces the rate of withholding tax on payments
         of interest or certifying that the income receivable pursuant to this
         Credit Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade
         or business in the United States, (ii) Internal Revenue Service Form
         W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the
         Internal Revenue Service, and (iii) any other form or certificate
         required by any taxing authority (including any certificate required by
         Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code), certifying
         that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from or a reduced rate of
         tax on payments pursuant to this Credit Agreement or any of the other
         Credit Documents.

                  (e) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed
         to provide the Borrower and the Agent with the appropriate form
         pursuant to Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in
         treaty, law, or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a
         form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be
         entitled to indemnification under Section 3.11(a) or 3.11(b) with
         respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided, however, that
                                                        --------  -------
         should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced
         rate of withholding tax, become subject to Taxes because of its failure
         to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such
         steps as such Lender shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to
         recover such Taxes.

                  (f) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to
         or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.11, then
         such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the
         jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or
         reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such
         change, in the judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (g) Within thirty (30) days after the date of any payment of
         Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original or a
         certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment.

                  (h) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement
         of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the
         Borrower contained in this Section 3.11 shall survive the repayment of
         the Revolving Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the
         Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

                                       43

         3.12     Compensation.
                  ------------

         Upon the request of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender
such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Lender) to compensate it for any loss, cost, or reasonable expense (including
loss of anticipated profits) incurred by it as a result of:

                  (a) any payment, prepayment, or conversion of a Eurodollar
         Loan for any reason (including, without limitation, the acceleration of
         the Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 9.2) on a date other than the
         last day of the Interest Period for such Revolving Loan; or

                  (b) any failure by the Borrower for any reason (including,
         without limitation, the failure of any condition precedent specified in
         Section 5 to be satisfied) to borrow, convert, continue, or prepay a
         Eurodollar Loan on the date for such borrowing, conversion,
         continuation, or prepayment specified in the relevant notice of
         borrowing, prepayment, continuation, or conversion under this Credit
         Agreement.

With respect to Eurodollar Loans, such indemnification may include an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (a) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the amount so prepaid, or not so borrowed, converted or continued,
for the period from the date of such prepayment or of such failure to borrow,
convert or continue to the last day of the applicable Interest Period (or, in
the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the Interest Period that
would have commenced on the date of such failure) in each case at the applicable
rate of interest for such Eurodollar Loans provided for herein over (b) the
amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which would have
accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on deposit for a
comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurodollar market. The
covenants of the Borrower set forth in this Section 3.12 shall survive the
repayment of the Revolving Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under
the Credit Documents and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

         3.13     Pro Rata Treatment.
                  ------------------

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

                  (a) Revolving Loans. Each Revolving Loan, each payment or
                      ---------------
         prepayment of principal of any Revolving Loan or reimbursement
         obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment
         of interest on the Revolving Loans or reimbursement obligations arising
         from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of Unused Fees,
         each payment of the Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction of the
         Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion or extension of any
         Revolving Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in
         accordance with the respective principal amounts of their outstanding
         Revolving Loans and Participation Interests.

                  (b) Advances. No Lender shall be responsible for the failure
                      --------
         or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make its ratable
         share of a borrowing hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of
                                         --------  -------
         any Lender to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any
         other Lender of its obligations hereunder. Unless the Agent shall have

                                       44

<PAGE>

         been notified by any Lender prior to the date of any requested
         borrowing that such Lender does not intend to make available to the
         Agent its ratable share of such borrowing to be made on such date, the
         Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to
         the Agent on the date of such borrowing, and the Agent in reliance
         upon such assumption, may (in its sole discretion but without any
         obligation to do so) make available to the Borrower a corresponding
         amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to
         the Agent, the Agent shall be able to recover such corresponding
         amount from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such
         corresponding amount forthwith upon the Agent's demand therefor, the
         Agent will promptly notify the Borrower, and the Borrower shall
         immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Agent. The Agent
         shall also be entitled to recover from the Lender or the Borrower, as
         the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of
         each day from the date such corresponding amount was made available by
         the Agent to the Borrower to the date such corresponding amount is
         recovered by the Agent at a per annum rate equal to (i) from the
         Borrower at the applicable rate for the applicable borrowing pursuant
         to the Notice of Borrowing or (ii) from a Lender at the Federal Funds
         Rate.

         3.14     Sharing of Payments.
                  -------------------

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Revolving Loan, LOC Obligations or any
other obligation owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a
secured claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other
security or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received
by such Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law
or otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Revolving
Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such
other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all
Lenders share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders further agree among
themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the
exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as
aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which
shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a
Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment,
including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such
Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such
Revolving Loan, LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such
Participation Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit
Agreement, if any Lender or the Agent shall fail to remit to the Agent or any
other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Agent to the Agent or such
other Lender pursuant to this Credit Agreement on the date when such amount is
due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date
from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Agent
or such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If
under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender
receives a secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies,
such Lender shall, to the extent

                                       45

<PAGE>

practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.14 to share in
the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

     3.15 Payments, Computations, Etc.
          ---------------------------

          (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments
     hereunder shall be made to the Agent in Dollars and in immediately
     available funds, without setoff, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of
     any kind, at the Agent's office specified in Section 11.1 not later than
     2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. Payments
     received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the next
     succeeding Business Day. The Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
     debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to any
     ordinary deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Agent (with
     notice to the Borrower). The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any
     payment under this Credit Agreement, specify to the Agent the Revolving
     Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees, interest or other amounts payable by the
     Borrower hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event
     that it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent
     with the terms hereof, the Agent shall distribute such payment to the
     Lenders in such manner as the Agent may determine to be appropriate in
     respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder, subject to the
     terms of Section 3.13(a)). The Agent will distribute such payments to such
     Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to 12:00 Noon (Charlotte,
     North Carolina time) on a Business Day in like funds as received prior to
     the end of such Business Day and otherwise the Agent will distribute such
     payment to such Lenders on the next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any
     payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
     Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
     Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and Fees for the period of
     such extension), except that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the
     extension would cause the payment to be made in the next following calendar
     month, then such payment shall instead be made on the next preceding
     Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all
     computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual
     number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to
     computation of interest on Base Rate Loans which (unless the Base Rate is
     determined by reference to the Federal Funds Rate) shall be calculated
     based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. Interest shall accrue

          THIRD, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and

     numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
     succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal

     "SIXTH" above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for
     distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to the

     first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time for any drawings
     under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all
     Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of the types described in
     clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner provided in this Section
     3.15(b).

     3.16 Evidence of Debt.
          ----------------

          (a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each
     Revolving Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time,
     including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
     Lender from time to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender shall

     time to time, as necessary.

          (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts
     maintained pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 3.16 (and, if
     consistent with the entries of the Agent, subsection (a)) shall be prima
     facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the
     Borrower therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any
                                --------  -------
     Lender or the Agent to maintain any such account, such Register or such
     subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall not in any manner
     affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Revolving Loans made by
     such Lender in accordance with the terms hereof.

     3.17 Replacement of Affected Lenders.
          -------------------------------

          If any Lender having a Commitment becomes a Defaulting Lender or if
     any Lender is owed increased costs under Section 3.8, Section 3.9, or
     Section 3.6, or the Borrower is required to make any payments under Section
     3.11 to any Lender in excess of those to the other Lenders, the Borrower
     shall have the right, if no Event of Default then exists, to replace such
     Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with one or more other Eligible Assignee or
                  ---------------
     Eligible Assignees, none of whom shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at
     the time of such replacement (collectively, the "Replacement Lender")
                                                      -------------------
     reasonably acceptable to the Agent, provided that (i) at the time of any
                                         --------
     replacement pursuant to this Section 3.17, the Replaced Lender and
     Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more assignment agreements, in
     form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such parties and the Agent,
     pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as
     the case may be, of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and
     participation in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans by, the Replaced
     Lender hereunder and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower owing to the
     Replaced Lender relating to the Loans so replaced (including, without
     limitation, such increased costs and excluding those specifically described
     in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price has
     been, or is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced
     Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the
     respective assignment documentation, the payment of amounts referred to in
     clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender,
     delivery to the Replacement Lender of an appropriate Revolving Note
     executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender
     hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender
     hereunder with respect to such replaced Revolving Loans, except with
     respect to indemnification provisions under this Agreement, which shall
     survive as to such Replaced Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the
     contrary contained above, (1) the Lender that acts as the Issuing Lender
     may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has Letters of Credit
     outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to the Issuing
     Lender (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit in
     form and substance, and issued by an issuer satisfactory to such Issuing
     Lender or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account
     maintained with the Agent in amounts and pursuant to arrangements
     satisfactory to such Issuing Lender) have been made with respect to such
     outstanding Letters of Credit and (2) the Lender that acts as the Agent may
     not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of

                                       48

<PAGE>

     Section 10.7. The Replaced Lender shall be required to deliver for
     cancellation its applicable Revolving Notes, to the extent applicable, to
     be canceled on the date of replacement, or if any such Revolving Note is
     lost or unavailable, such other assurances or indemnification therefor as
     the Borrower may reasonably request.


                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY
                                    --------

     4.1 The Guaranty.
         ------------

     Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement or
enters into an Equity Swap Agreement, and the Agent as hereinafter provided the
prompt payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at
stated maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof.
The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit Party Obligations
are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same,
without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension
of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same
will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any
other of the Credit Documents, Hedging Agreements or Equity Swap Agreements, to
the extent the obligations of a Guarantor shall be adjudicated to be invalid or
unenforceable for any reason (including, without limitation, because of any
applicable state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances or transfers)
then the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to the maximum
amount that is permissible under applicable law (whether federal or state and
including, without limitation, the Bankruptcy Code).

     4.2 Obligations Unconditional.
         -------------------------

     The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and several,
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents, Hedging Agreements
or Equity Swap Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to
therein, or any substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other
guarantee of or security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other
circumstance whatsoever which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this
Section 4.2 that the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute
and unconditional under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that
such Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or
contribution against the Borrower or any other Guarantor of the Credit Party
Obligations for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the Lenders
(and any Affiliates of Lenders entering into Hedging

                                       49

<PAGE>

Agreements or Equity Swap Agreements) have been paid in full, all Commitments
under this Credit Agreement have been terminated and no Person or Governmental
Authority shall have any right to request any return or reimbursement of funds
from the Lenders in connection with monies received under the Credit Documents,
Hedging Agreements or Equity Swap Agreements. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or impair the
liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

          (a) at any time or from time to time, without notice to any Guarantor,
     the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the Credit Party
     Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or compliance shall be
     waived;

          (b) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the
     Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement, any Equity Swap Agreement or any
     other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents, Hedging
     Agreements or Equity Swap Agreements shall be done or omitted;

          (c) the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
     accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be modified,
     supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the
     Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement, any Equity Swap Agreement or any
     other agreement or instrument referred to in the Credit Documents, Hedging
     Agreements or Equity Swap Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee
     of any of the Credit Party Obligations or any security therefor shall be
     released, impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt
     with;

          (d) any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Agent or any Lender or
     Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations shall fail to
     attach or be perfected; or

          (e) any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be determined to be void
     or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any creditor
     of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person
     (including, without limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever (except notices expressly provided for in the Credit Documents), and
any requirement that the Agent or any Lender exhaust any right, power or remedy
or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents, any Hedging
Agreement, Equity Swap Agreement or any other agreement or instrument referred
to in the Credit Documents, Hedging Agreements or Equity Swap Agreement, or
against any other Person under any other guarantee of, or security for, any of
the Credit Party Obligations.

     4.3 Reinstatement.
         -------------
     The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization

                                       50

<PAGE>

or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify the Agent and
each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the Agent or such Lender
in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any such costs and
expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that such payment
constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment under any
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

     4.4 Certain Additional Waivers.
         --------------------------

     Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse
to security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the exercise of
rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights
of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

     4.5 Remedies.
         --------

     The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the
other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2)
for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
secured in accordance with the terms of the Pledge Agreement and that the
Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms
thereof.

     4.6 Rights of Contribution.
         ----------------------

     The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full to the Agent and
the Lenders of the Guaranteed Obligations, and none of the Guarantors shall
exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any other Guarantor
until payment and satisfaction in full of all of such Guaranteed Obligations.
For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) "Guaranteed Obligations" shall mean any
                                       ----------------------

                                                                       ------
Payment" shall mean the amount paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata
-------
Share of any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) "Pro Rata Share" shall mean, for any
                                          --------------
Guarantor in respect of any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, the ratio
(expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed
Obligations of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value
of all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and
liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value
of all assets and other properties of the

                                       51

<PAGE>

Borrower and all of the Guarantors exceeds the amount of all of the debts and
liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Borrower and the Guarantors
hereunder) of the Borrower and all of the Guarantors; provided, however, that,
                                                      --------  -------
for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata Shares of the Guarantors in respect of
any payment of Guaranteed Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor
subsequent to the date of any such payment shall be deemed to have been a
Guarantor on the date of such payment and the financial information for such
Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for
such Guarantor in connection with such payment; and (d) "Contribution Share"
                                                         ------------------
shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of any Excess Payment made by any other
Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess
Payment of (i) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value of
all of its assets and properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities
of such Guarantor (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and
unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor
hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the aggregate present fair salable value
of all assets and other properties of the Borrower and all of the Guarantors
other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of all of the
debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and
unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Borrower and the
Guarantors hereunder) of the Borrower and all of the Guarantors other than the
maker of such Excess Payment; provided, however, that, for purposes of
                              --------  -------
calculating the Contribution Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any Excess
Payment, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any
such Excess Payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such
Excess Payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date
such Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in
connection with such Excess Payment. This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to
affect any right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that
any Guarantor may have under applicable law against the Borrower in respect of
any payment of Guaranteed Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights
of contribution against any Guarantor shall terminate from and after such time,
if ever, that such Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to
Section 8.4.

         --------------------

     The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

     Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliate would become subject to any
     material withdrawal liability under ERISA if any Consolidated Party or any
     ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw completely from all Multiemployer Plans
     and Multiple Employer Plans as of the valuation date most closely preceding
     the date on which this representation is made or deemed made. Neither any
     Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any notification
     that any Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of

     has occurred with respect to a Plan which has subjected or may subject any
     Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate to any material liability under
     Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,
     or under any agreement or other instrument pursuant to which any
     Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required to
     indemnify any person against any such liability.

          (e) Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliates has any
     material liability with respect to "expected post-retirement benefit

         9.2      Acceleration; Remedies.
                  ----------------------

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, and at any time thereafter
unless and until such Event of Default has been waived by the requisite Lenders
(pursuant to the voting requirements of Section 11.6) or cured to the
satisfaction of the requisite Lenders (pursuant to the voting procedures in
Section 11.6), the Agent shall, upon the request and direction of the Required
Lenders, by written notice to the Credit Parties take any of the following
actions:

                  (a)      Termination of Commitments.  Declare the Commitments
                           --------------------------
         terminated whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b)      Acceleration. Declare the unpaid principal of and any
                           ------------

         Credit and any and all other indebtedness or obligations of any and
         every kind owing by the Borrower to the Agent and/or any of the Lenders
         hereunder to be due whereupon the same shall be immediately due and
         payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
         kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.

                  (c)      Cash Collateral. Direct the Borrower to pay (and the
                           ---------------
         Borrower agrees that upon receipt of such notice, or upon the
         occurrence of an Event of Default under Section 9.1(f), it will
         immediately pay) to the Agent additional cash, to be held by the Agent,
         for the benefit of the Lenders, in a cash collateral account as
         additional security for the LOC Obligations in respect of subsequent
         drawings under all then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount
         equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn under all
         Letters of Credits then outstanding.

                  (d)      Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and

         without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Pledge
         Agreement, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and all rights
         of set-off.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in
Section 9.1(f) shall occur, then the Commitments shall automatically terminate
and all Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans, all reimbursement obligations arising
from drawings under Letters of Credit, all accrued interest in respect thereof,
all accrued and unpaid Fees and other indebtedness or obligations owing to the
Agent and/or any of the Lenders hereunder automatically shall immediately become
due and payable without the giving of any notice or other action by the Agent or
the Lenders.

                                   SECTION 10

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS
                                -----------------

         10.1     Appointment and Authorization of Agent.
                  --------------------------------------

                  (a)   Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 10.9)
         appoints, designates and authorizes Bank of America as the Agent under
         this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and authorizes Bank of
         America, as the Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
         provisions of this Credit Agreement and each other Credit Document and
         to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly
         delegated to it by the terms of this Credit Agreement or any other
         Credit Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental
         thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
         elsewhere herein or in any other Credit Document, the Agent shall not
         have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth
         herein, nor shall the Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
         relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
         functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall
         be read into this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or
         otherwise exist against the Agent. Without limiting the generality of
         the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" herein and in the
         other Credit Documents with reference to the Agent is not intended to
         connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising
         under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used
         merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or
         reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
         contracting parties.

                  (b)   The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders
         with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents
         associated therewith until such time (and except for so long) as the
         Agent may agree at the request of the Required Lenders to act for the
         Issuing Lender with respect thereto; provided, however, that the
                                              --------  -------
         Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i)
         provided to the Agent in this Section 10 with respect to any acts taken
         or omissions suffered by the Issuing Lender in connection with Letters
         of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the
         application and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the
         Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Agent" as used in this
         Section 10 included the Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or
         omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the
         Issuing Lender.

         10.2     Delegation of Duties.
                  --------------------

         The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Credit Agreement or
any other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact
and shall be entitled to advice of

                                       77

<PAGE>

counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct
of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct.

         10.3     Liability of Agent.
                  ------------------

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated hereby
(except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any
other Credit Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in
connection with, this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or for any failure of any Credit
Party or any other party to any Credit Document to perform its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation
to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

         10.4     Reliance by Agent.
                  -----------------

                  (a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
         protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
         resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
         letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or
         other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
         and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
         and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
         any Credit Party), independent accountants and other experts selected
         by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
         to take any action under any Credit Document unless it shall first
         receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
         appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
         its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
         expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
         to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully
         protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Credit
         Agreement or any other Credit Document in accordance with a request or
         consent of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, if required
         hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
         pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and
         participants. Where this Credit Agreement expressly permits or
         prohibits an action unless the Required Lenders otherwise determine,
         the Agent shall, and in all other instances, the Agent may, but shall
         not be required to, initiate any solicitation for the consent or a vote
         of the Lenders.

                  (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
         specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this Credit
         Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or
         to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the
         Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction,

                                       78

<PAGE>

         or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable
         or satisfactory to a Lender.

         10.5     Notice of Default.
                  -----------------

         The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults
in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Agent
for the account of the Lenders, unless the Agent shall have received written
notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Credit Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default." The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any
such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Section 9; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has received any
           --------  -------
such direction, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action,
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

         10.6     Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agent.
                  ---------------------------------------------------

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of
the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Agent
that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Credit
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Credit Agreement and to extend credit to the
Borrower and the other Credit Parties hereunder. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit
Documents, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform
itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Agent herein, the Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related
Person.

         10.7     Indemnification of Agent.
                  ------------------------

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Credit Party to do so), pro

                                       79

<PAGE>

rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however, that no Lender shall
                                        --------  -------
be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such
Indemnified Liabilities resulting from such Person's gross negligence or willful
misconduct; provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the
            --------  -------
directions of the Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross
negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without
limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon demand
for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including attorney
costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether
through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in
respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement, any other
Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the
extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the
Commitments, the payment of all Credit Party Obligations hereunder and the
resignation or replacement of the Agent.

         10.8     Agent in its Individual Capacity.
                  --------------------------------

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective
Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent or the Issuing Lender
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Credit Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Revolving
Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though
it were not the Agent or the Issuing Lender, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

         10.9     Successor Agent.
                  ---------------

         The Agent may resign as Agent upon thirty (30) days' notice to the
Lenders. If the Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the Required Lenders
shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor Agent for the Lenders which
successor Agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at all times other than
during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor Agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor Agent
from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
Agent hereunder, such successor Agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers
and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
Agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Section 10 and Sections 11.4 and 11.9 shall inure to its
benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent
under this Credit Agreement. If no successor Agent has accepted appointment as
Agent by the date which is thirty (30) days following a retiring Agent's

                                       80

<PAGE>

notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor agent as provided for above.

         10.10    Other Agents; Book Managers.
                  ---------------------------

         None of the Lenders identified on the facing page or signature pages of
this Credit Agreement as a "syndication agent", "documentation agent" or "sole
book manager" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility
or duty under this Credit Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders
as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders so identified shall
have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the
Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Credit Agreement or in
taking or not taking action hereunder.

         11.2     Right of Set-Off; Adjustments.
                  -----------------------------

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest

                                       82

<PAGE>

extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to or
for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against any and all of the
obligations of such Person now or hereafter existing under this Credit
Agreement, under the Revolving Notes, if any, under any other Credit Document or
otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have made any demand
hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify any affected Credit Party after any such
set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure
                                             --------  -------
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 11.2 are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) that such Lender may have.

         11.3     Successors and Assigns.
                  ----------------------

                  (a) The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding
         upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
         respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
         Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
         obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender
         (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such
         consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement,
         expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
         (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
         permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the
         Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
         reason of this Credit Agreement.

                  (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees
         all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the
         Revolving Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b),
         participations in LOC Obligations and in Swingline Loans) at the time
         owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of
                       --------
         the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and
         the Revolving Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
         assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund
         with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which
         for this purpose includes Revolving Loans outstanding thereunder)
         subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the
         Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
         to the Agent, shall not be less than $5,000,000 and in integral
         multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof, unless each of the Agent and,
         so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an
         assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Credit Agreement with respect to the
         Revolving Loans or the Commitments assigned, except that this clause
         (ii) shall not apply to rights in respect of outstanding Swingline
         Loans, and (iii) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
         deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
         processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and
         recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this
         Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
         and Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party
         hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such

                                       83

<PAGE>

         Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
         under this Credit Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
         to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Credit
         Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering
         all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
         continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.9, 3.11, 3.12,
         and 11.5). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute
         and deliver new or replacement Revolving Notes to the assigning Lender
         and the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
         rights or obligations under this Credit Agreement that does not comply
         with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Credit
         Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
         and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c) The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
         the Borrower, shall maintain at the Agent's principal office in
         Charlotte, North Carolina a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance
         delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
         addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount
         of the Revolving Loans and LOC Obligations owing to, each Lender
         pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
                                                              --------
         entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the
         Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in
         the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all
         purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
         contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
         Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time
         upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the
         Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
         other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
                            -----------
         rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or
         a portion of its Commitments and/or the Revolving Loans (including such
         Lender's participations in LOC Obligations and/or Swingline Loans)
         owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
                       --------
         Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain
         solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
         such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent and the other
         Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
         connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Credit
         Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
         such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
         sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any
         amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit
         Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
                    --------
         such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to
         any amendment, waiver or other modification that would (i) postpone any
         date upon which any payment of money is scheduled to be paid to such
         Participant, (ii) reduce the principal, interest, fees or other amounts
         payable to such Participant or (iii) release all or substantially all
         of the Guarantors from their obligations under Credit Agreement and the
         other Credit Documents. Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the
         Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
         of Sections 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 to the same extent as if it were a
         Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
         subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
         Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as

                                       84

<PAGE>

         though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject
                                  --------
         to Section 3.14 as though it were a Lender.

                  (e) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
         payment under Sections 3.6, 3.9 or 3.11 than the applicable Lender
         would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
         sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
         Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A
         Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall
         not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.11 unless the Borrower is
         notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
         Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
         Section 3.11(b) as though it were a Lender.

                  (f) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
         interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit
         Agreement (including under its Revolving Notes, if any) to secure
         obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to
         secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such
                                                       ---------
         pledge or assignment shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
         hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
         a party hereto.

                  (g) If the consent of the Borrower to an assignment or to an
         Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an
         assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment threshold
         specified in clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of Section
         11.3(b)), the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five
         (5) Business Days after the date notice thereof has been delivered by
         the assigning Lender (through the Agent) unless such consent is
         expressly refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth Business Day.

                  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
         if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitments and
         Revolving Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may,
         (i) upon thirty (30) days' notice to the Borrower and the Lenders,
         resign as Issuing Lender and/or (ii) upon five (5) Business Days'
         notice to the Borrower, terminate the Swingline Commitment. In the
         event of any such resignation as Issuing Lender or termination of the
         Swingline Commitment, the Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from
         among the Lenders a successor Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender
         hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Borrower to
                    --------  -------
         appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of Bank of
         America as Issuing Lender or the termination of the Swingline
         Commitment, as the case may be. Bank of America shall retain all the
         rights and obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to
         all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its
         resignation as Issuing Lender and all LOC Obligations with respect
         thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate
         Loans or fund participations in Letters of Credit pursuant to Section
         2.2(c)). If Bank of America terminates the Swingline Commitment, it
         shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for
         hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as
         of the effective date of such termination, including the right to
         require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund participations in
         outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(iii).

<PAGE>

         11.4     No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
                  ------------------------------

         No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document and no course of dealing between the Agent or any Lender and any of the
Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and
remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle the Borrower or any other
Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders
to any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

         11.5     Expenses; Indemnification.
                  -------------------------

         (a)      The Borrower agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses of
the Agent in connection with the syndication, preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, and amendment of this Credit Agreement, the other
Credit Documents, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent
with respect thereto and with respect to advising the Agent as to its rights and
responsibilities under the Credit Documents. The Borrower further agrees to pay
on demand all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if
any, in connection with the enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings, or otherwise) of the Credit Documents and the other documents to be
delivered hereunder.

         (b)      Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Credit Parties agree to indemnify, save and hold harmless each
Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (collectively the
"Indemnitees") from and against: (i) any and all claims, demands, actions or
 -----------
causes of action that are asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (other
than the Agent or any Lender) relating directly or indirectly to a claim,
demand, action or cause of action that such Person asserts or may assert against
any Credit Party, any Affiliate of any Credit Party or any of their respective
officers or directors; (ii) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of
action that may at any time (including at any time following repayment of the
Credit Party Obligations and the resignation or removal of the Agent or the
replacement of any Lender) be asserted or imposed against any Indemnitee,
arising out of or relating to, the Credit Documents, any predecessor loan
documents, the Commitments, the use or contemplated use of the proceeds of any
Loan or Letter of Credit, the relationship of any Credit Party, the Agent and
the Lenders under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or any
actual or alleged breach of any Environmental Law; (iii) any administrative or
investigative proceeding by any Governmental Authority arising out of or related
to a claim, demand, action or cause of action described in subsection (i) or
(ii) above; and (iv) any and all liabilities (including liabilities under
indemnities), losses, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney costs)
that any Indemnitee suffers or incurs as a result of the assertion of any
foregoing claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding, or as a result
of the preparation of any defense in connection with any foregoing claim,
demand, action, cause of action or proceeding, in all cases, whether or not
arising out of the negligence of an Indemnitee, and whether or not an Indemnitee
is a party to

                                       86

<PAGE>

such claim, demand, action, cause of action or proceeding (all the foregoing,
collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided that no Indemnitee shall
                   ----------- -----------    --------
be entitled to indemnification for any claim caused by its own gross negligence
or willful misconduct or for any loss asserted against it by another Indemnitee.
The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of the Commitments
and repayment of all the Credit Party Obligations.

         11.6     Amendments, Waivers and Consents.
                  --------------------------------

         Neither this Credit Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any of
the terms hereof or thereof may be amended, changed, waived, discharged or
terminated unless such amendment, change, waiver, discharge or termination is in
writing entered into by, or approved in writing by, the Required Lenders and the
Borrower, provided, however, that:
          --------  -------

                  (a)       without the consent of each Lender affected thereby,
         no such amendment, change or waiver shall:

                     (i)    extend the final maturity of any Loan or the time of
                  payment of any reimbursement obligation, or any portion
                  thereof, arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, or
                  extend or waive the principal payment of any Loan, or any
                  portion thereof;

                     (ii)   reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
                  interest (other than as a result of waiving the applicability
                  of any post-default increase in interest rates) thereon or
                  Fees or costs hereunder;

                     (iii)  reduce or waive the principal amount of any Loan
                  (except for the waiver of a mandatory prepayment required by
                  Section 3.3(b) hereof) or of any reimbursement obligation, or
                  any portion thereof, arising from drawings under Letters of
                  Credit;

                     (iv)   increase the Commitment of a Lender over the amount
                  thereof in effect (it being understood and agreed that a
                  waiver of any Default or Event of Default or mandatory
                  reduction in the Commitments shall not constitute a change in
                  the terms of any Commitment of any Lender);

                     (v)    release all or substantially all of the Pledged
                  Collateral;

                     (vi)   except as the result of or in connection with a
                  dissolution, merger or disposition of a Subsidiary permitted
                  under Section 8.4, release the Borrower or substantially all
                  of the other Credit Parties from its or their obligations
                  under the Credit Documents;

                     (vii)  amend, modify or waive any provision of this
                  Section 11.6 or Section 3.14;

                     (viii) reduce any percentage specified in, or otherwise
                  modify, the definition of Required Lenders; or

                                       87

<PAGE>

                       (ix) consent to the assignment or transfer by the
                  Borrower or all or substantially all of the other Credit
                  Parties of any of its or their rights and obligations under
