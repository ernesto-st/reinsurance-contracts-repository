Employment with the Firm is terminated by reason of Extended Absence or

unvested 2002 Year-End Options (as a result of which any such then unvested outstanding 2002 Year-End
Options shall vest), but all other conditions of this Award Agreement shall continue to apply.
</FONT>

<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without limiting the application of Paragraph&nbsp;4(c)(ii), your rights in
respect of any outstanding 2002 Year-End Options that become vested solely by reason of
Paragraph&nbsp;4(d)(i) immediately shall terminate, and no such 2002 Year-End Options shall be
exercisable if, following the termination of your Employment with the Firm by reason of Extended Absence or

interest in, any Competitive Enterprise, or (ii)&nbsp;associate (including, but not limited to, association as an

by you, including any termination claimed to be a &#147;constructive termination&#148; or termination for &#147;good

terminated, such outstanding
vested 2002 Year-End Options (including any such 2002 Year-End Options that
