the total interest due hereunder (taking into account the increase provided for above) is less than the total amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in
effect, then to the extent permitted by law, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate
had at all times been in effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of Lenders and the Borrower to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws. Accordingly, if any Lender contracts for, charges, or receives any consideration which
constitutes interest in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate, then any such excess shall be cancelled automatically and, if previously paid, shall at such Lender&#146;s option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Loans made hereunder or be

or under any present or future laws to levy or distraint for rent or any other charges which may be due to Landlord against the Collateral, and any and all other claims, liens and demands of every kind which it now has or may hereafter have against

license to enter upon and into the Premises to do any or all of the following with respect to the Collateral: assemble, have appraised, display, remove, maintain, prepare for sale or lease, repair, transfer, or sell (at public or private sale). In
entering upon or into the Premises, each Agent hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims, judgments, liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by Landlord caused solely by such Agent&#146;s
entering upon or into the Premises and taking any of the foregoing actions with respect to the Collateral. Such costs shall include any damage to the Premises made by such Agent in severing and/or removing the Collateral therefrom. </P>

will deliver notice (the &#147;<U>Landlord&#146;s Notice</U>&#148;) to each Agent to that effect. Within the 45 day period after such Agent receives the Landlord&#146;s Notice, such Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cause the
Collateral to be removed from the Premises. During such 45 day period, Landlord will not remove the Collateral from the Premises nor interfere with such Agent&#146;s actions in removing the Collateral from the Premises or such Agent&#146;s actions
