amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the
Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds
the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a)&nbsp;characterize any
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b)&nbsp;exclude
voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)&nbsp;amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of this
Agreement.

below), that Funding Guarantor shall, subject to <U>paragraph 7</U> hereof, be entitled to a

Shortfall (as defined below), with the result that all such contributions will cause each
Guarantor&#146;s Aggregate Payments (as defined below) to equal its Fair Share. &#147;<U><B>Fair Share</B></U>&#148;
means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (i)&nbsp;the
ratio of (x)&nbsp;the Adjusted Maximum Amount (as defined below) with respect to such Guarantor to (y)
the aggregate of the Adjusted Maximum Amounts with respect to all Guarantors, multiplied by (ii)
the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or before such date by all Funding Guarantors under
this Guaranty Agreement or under the other Loan Documents in respect of the obligations guarantied.
&#147;<U><B>Fair Share Shortfall</B></U>&#148; means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of determination,
the excess, if any, of the Fair Share of such Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of such
Guarantor. &#147;<U><B>Adjusted Maximum Amount</B></U>&#148; means, with respect to a Guarantor as of any date of
determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of such Guarantor under this
Guaranty Agreement and the other Transaction Documents determined in accordance with the provisions
hereof (including, without limitation, the limitations on such obligations contained in
<U>paragraph 1</U> hereof); <U>provided</U> that, solely for purposes of calculating the Adjusted
Maximum Amount with respect to any Guarantor for purposes of this <U>paragraph 8</U> the assets or
liabilities arising by virtue of any rights to or obligations of contribution hereunder shall not
be considered as assets or liabilities of such Guarantor. &#147;<U><B>Aggregate Payments</B></U>&#148; means, with
respect to a Guarantor as of any date of determination, the aggregate amount of all payments and
distributions made on or before such date by such Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, in
respect of this <U>paragraph 8</U>). The amounts payable as contributions hereunder shall be
determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the applicable
Funding Guarantor. The allocation
among Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this <U>paragraph 8</U> shall not be
construed in any way to limit the liability of any Guarantor hereunder or under any other
Transaction Document.

effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if and to the extent at any time payment, in whole
or in part, of any of the sums due to any Creditor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by such entity upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Obligated Party or any Guarantor, or upon or as a
result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers
with respect to any Obligated Party, any Guarantor or any substantial part of their respective
properties, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. If an event permitting
the acceleration of the maturity of the principal due under any Transaction Document shall at any
time have occurred and be continuing and such acceleration shall at such time be prevented or the
right of any Creditor to receive any payment under the applicable Transaction Document shall at
such time be delayed or otherwise affected by reason of the pendency against any Obligated Party of
a case or proceeding under a bankruptcy or insolvency law, each Guarantor agrees that, for purposes
of this Guaranty Agreement and its obligations hereunder, the maturity of such principal amount
shall be deemed to have been accelerated with the same effect as if the applicable Creditor had
accelerated the same in accordance with the terms of the applicable Transaction Documents, and any
Guarantor shall forthwith pay such accelerated principal amount, accrued interest and premium, if
any, thereon and any other amounts guaranteed hereunder.

Guaranteed Obligations arising under the Loan Documents, and with respect to the other Transaction
Documents, the applicable Creditor thereunder, in currency required by the applicable Transaction
Document and in immediately available funds, at the times and places provided in, and otherwise
strictly in accordance with the terms and provisions of, the applicable Transaction Document
(regardless of any law, regulation or decree now or hereafter in effect which might in any manner
affect the Guaranteed Obligations, or the rights of any such entity with respect thereto as against
any Obligated Party, or cause or permit to be invoked any alteration in the time, amount or manner
of payment by any Obligated Party of any or all of the Guaranteed Obligations), without set-off or
counterclaim and free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes. If any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amount payable by any Guarantor to any Creditor under this Guaranty Agreement, the amounts so
payable to such holder shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to such entity (after
payment of all Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes) interest or any such other amounts at the rates
or in the amounts specified in the applicable Transaction Document. Notwithstanding any provision
of the definition of &#147;Excluded Taxes&#148; to the contrary, for purposes of this Section&nbsp;10, with
respect to any Guarantor that is a Foreign Subsidiary, Indemnified Taxes shall include all
withholding taxes that would be imposed on amounts payable under this Guaranty Agreement by such
Guarantor to any Lender at the time such Guarantor becomes a party to this Guaranty Agreement,
except to the extent attributable to such Lender&#146;s failure to comply with the following sentence.

into the Credit Agreement and each Guarantor&#146;s executing and delivering this Guaranty Agreement (in
light of, among other things, the contribution provisions of paragraph 8 hereof) is reasonably
