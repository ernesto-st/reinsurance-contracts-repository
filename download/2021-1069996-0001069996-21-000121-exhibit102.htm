Scottsdale, Arizona  (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Subscribing Reinsurer&quot;    It Is Hereby Agreed that, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, payments and  releases set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is  hereby acknowledged, the Subscribing Reinsurer's share in the liabilities of the &quot;Reinsurer&quot;  under the Company's Non-Florida Property Quota Share Reinsurance Contract, effective July 1,  2020 and terminated January 31, 2021 (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Reinsurance Contract&quot;),  shall be commuted as of January 31, 2021 in accordance with the provisions set forth below.   This Agreement shall serve to fully and finally determine, settle and extinguish all rights,  liabilities, claims, disputes and obligations under the Reinsurance Contract, whether known or  unknown, between the parties to this Agreement.    It Is Further Agreed, in order to effect said commutation and release, the parties agree as  follows:    A. The Subscribing Reinsurer shall pay the Company a provisional payment of $7,202,604  (the &#8220;Provisional Payment&#8221;) immediately after the execution of this Agreement.  The  Provisional Payment is subject to a potential one-time adjustment, by mutual agreement,  after receipt of the final reserve analysis performed by KPMG for the Company (the  &#8220;Reserve Analysis&#8221;).   If the Reserve Analysis (i) calls for an increase in the amount  payable to the Company hereunder, the Subscribing Reinsurer shall remit such additional  payment to the Company, or (ii) calls for a decrease in the amount payable to the Company  hereunder, the Company shall remit such amount to the Subscribing Reinsurer, and in  either case, payment shall be made within five (5) business days after the Company and  Subscribing Reinsurer have mutually agreed on the adjustment resulting in an increase or  decrease in the Reserve Analysis (the &#8220;Payment Adjustment&#8221;).   The Subscribing  Reinsurer&#8217;s remittance of the Provisional Payment, together with the Payment Adjustment,  if applicable (the Provisional Payment and the Payment Adjustment, collectively, the &#8220;Final  Payment&#8221;), to the Company will represent the full satisfaction of all liabilities and obligations  of the Subscribing Reinsurer under the Reinsurance Contract, whether known or unknown.    B. Upon The Company&#8217;s receipt of the Final Payment, each party, on behalf of its parents,  subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors, successors, assigns, and its past, present and future  officers, directors, shareholders, employees, consultants, administrators, agents, receivers,  trustees, attorneys and its legal representatives, unconditionally and completely releases  and forever discharges the other party, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, predecessors,  successors, assigns, and its past, present and future officers, directors, shareholders,  employees, consultants, administrators, agents, receivers, trustees, attorneys and its legal  representatives from any and all past, present and future rights, liabilities and obligations,  including, but not limited to, payments, adjustments, executions, offsets, actions, causes of  action, proofs of claim, suits, debts, sums of money, accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills,  covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements, promises, damages, judgments, claims,  demands, duties, doings, omissions, costs, disbursements, fees, attorneys' fees, expenses,  injuries and/or losses of every kind, whether known or unknown, reported or unreported,  fixed or contingent, relating to or arising out of the Reinsurance Contract.  </FONT></DIV>

The  representatives executing this Agreement on behalf of each party have the full and legal  right, power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement on behalf of each party,  and there are no pending conditions, agreements, transactions or negotiations to which  either is a party that would render this Agreement or any part hereof void, voidable or  unenforceable.

Notwithstanding the above, in the event that either party is required by court order, other  legal process or any regulatory authority to release or disclose any or all of the confidential  information, such party agrees to provide the other party with written notice of same at least  10 days prior to such release or disclosure, to the extent legally permissible, and to use its  best efforts to assist the other party in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in this  paragraph I.

K. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the  State of Florida.    L. The failure of either party to insist on compliance with this Agreement or to exercise any  right, remedy or option hereunder shall not:  (1) constitute a waiver of any rights contained  in this Agreement, (2) prevent either party from thereafter demanding full and complete  compliance, (3) prevent either party from exercising such remedy in the future, nor (4)  affect the validity of this Agreement or any part thereof.    M. If any provision of this Agreement shall be rendered illegal or unenforceable by the laws,  regulations or public policy of any jurisdiction, regulatory body or court, such provision shall  be considered void in such jurisdiction, but this shall not affect the validity or enforceability  of any other provision of this Agreement or the enforceability of such provision in any other  jurisdiction.    N. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which when so  executed and delivered shall be an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute  one and the same instrument and agreement.  A counterpart may be delivered via facsimile  or electronic mail, and the facsimile or document attached to the electronic mail received  shall be deemed to be an original.    O. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto and  supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties.  No  supplement, amendment, modification, waiver or termination of this Agreement shall be  effective unless in writing and signed by both parties.    </FONT></DIV>
