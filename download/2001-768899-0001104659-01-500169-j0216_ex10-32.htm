reason, the other Undersigned shall, nevertheless, be bound hereunder for the full
amount of the liability as aforesaid. The invalidity of any provision of this
Agreement by reason of the law of any state or for any other reason shall not
affect the validity of any other provision of this Agreement, and Undersigned

if the invalid provision had not existed.</font></p>
