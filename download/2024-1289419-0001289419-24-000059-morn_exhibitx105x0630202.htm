(b) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of an Alternative Currency Loan or the issuance, amendment or extension of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, Alternative Currency Loan or Letter of Credit is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount (rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.50 of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be. (c) The Administrative Agent does not warrant, nor accept responsibility, nor shall the Administrative Agent have any liability with respect to the administration, submission or any other matter related to the rates in the definition of &#8220;SOFR&#8221;, &#8220;Term SOFR&#8221;, &#8220;Daily Simple SOFR&#8221;, &#8220;Alternative Currency Daily Rate&#8221; or &#8220;Alternative Currency Term Rate&#8221;, the selection of rates, any related spread or adjustment or with respect to any rate that is an alternative or replacement for or successor to any of such rates (including, without limitation, any Successor Rate) or the effect of any of the foregoing, or of any Successor Rate Conforming Changes. (d) By agreeing to make Loans under this Agreement, each Lender is confirming it has all licenses, permits and approvals necessary for use of the reference rates referred to herein and it will do all things necessary to comply, preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect such licenses, permits and approvals.  45 1.08 Additional Alternative Currencies. (a) The Company may from time to time request that Alternative Currency Loans be made and/or Letters of Credit be issued in a currency other than those specifically listed in the definition of &#8220;Alternative Currency&#8221;; provided that such requested currency is an Eligible Currency. In the case of any such request with respect to the making of Alternative Currency Loans, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and each Lender with a Commitment under which such currency is requested to be made available; and in the case of any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit, such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer. (b) Any such request shall be made to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., ten (10) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Credit Extension (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the L/C Issuers, in its or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request pertaining to Alternative Currency Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request pertaining to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the L/C Issuers thereof. Each Appropriate Lender (in the case of any such request pertaining to Alternative Currency Loans) or the L/C Issuers (in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m., five (5) Business Days after receipt of such request whether it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Alternative Currency Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such requested currency. (c) Any failure by a Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to respond to such request within the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to permit Alternate Currency Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Appropriate Lenders consent to making Alternate Currency Loans in such requested currency and the Administrative Agent and such Lenders reasonably determine that an appropriate interest rate is available to be used for such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company and (i) the Administrative Agent and such Lenders may amend the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate to the extent necessary to add the applicable rate for such currency and any applicable adjustment for such rate and (ii) to the extent the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate, as applicable, has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency for purposes of any Borrowings of Alternative Currency Loans. If the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers consent to the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company and the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuers may amend the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate, as applicable, to the extent necessary to add the applicable rate for such currency and any applicable adjustment for such rate and to the extent the definition of Alternative Currency Daily Rate or Alternative Currency Term Rate, as applicable, has been amended to reflect the appropriate rate for such currency, such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative Currency, for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent to any request for an additional currency under this Section 1.09, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Company. 1.09 Change of Currency. (a) Each obligation of the Borrowers to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its lawful currency after 46 the date hereof shall be redenominated into Euro at the time of such adoption. If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that, if any Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period. (b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro. (c) Each provision of this Agreement also shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect a change in currency of any other country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change in currency. 1.10 Existing CDOR Rate Loans. For the avoidance of doubt, the Interest Periods for all Term Rate Loans determined by reference  to the CDOR Rate (as such terms are defined in this Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date) outstanding under this Agreement, if any, shall remain in effect as Term Rate Loans determined by reference to the CDOR Rate (as defined in this Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date) under this Agreement without renewal, interruption or extension, and shall accrue interest at the rate of interest calculated based on the CDOR Rate (as defined in this Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date), solely for the duration of any such Interest Periods (as defined in this Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date) and shall be repaid by the Borrower at the end of such Interest Periods (as defined in this Agreement as in effect immediately prior to the Third Amendment Effective Date) ARTICLE II COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS 2.01 Loans. (a) Term Borrowing. (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Term Lender severally agrees to make up to one (1) loan to the Company in Dollars from time to time, on any Business Day during the Availability Period for the Term Facility, in an aggregate amount not to exceed such Term Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the Term Facility (which such loan (i.e. the Term Loan (First Draw)) was funded on the Specified Acquisition Closing Date). The Term Borrowing shall consist of Term Loans made simultaneously by the Term Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentage of the Term Facility. Term Borrowings repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as further provided herein; provided, however, any Term Borrowing made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans unless 47 </FONT></DIV>

(ii) On the Second Amendment Effective Date, pursuant to the terms hereof, each Term Lender with a Second Amendment Term Commitment, severally and not jointly, shall make an additional term loan denominated in Dollars to the Company (collectively, the &#8220;Second Amendment Term Loans&#8221;) in an aggregate amount not to exceed such Term Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the Second Amendment Term Commitments. The Second Amendment Term Commitments shall terminate concurrently with the making of the Second Amendment Term Loans on the Second Amendment Effective Date.  Term Borrowings of the Second Amendment Term Loans repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed. Second Amendment Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as further provided herein.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the Second Amendment Term Loans shall have all the terms and conditions applicable to, the initial Term Loans made pursuant to the Term Commitments provided on the Closing Date for all purposes under this Agreement and each Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Second Amendment Term Loans shall (x) constitute Obligations under the Loan Documents and have all of the benefits thereof, (x) have all of the rights, remedies, privileges and protections applicable to the Term Loans made prior to the Second Amendment Effective  and (z) all references to &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;, &#8220;a Term Loan&#8221;, &#8220;any Term Loan&#8221;, or &#8220;the Term Loans&#8221; contained in this Agreement and/or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to include the Second Amendment Term Loans.

Revolving Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans, as further provided herein, provided that Alternative Currency Loans will be Alternative Daily Rate Loans or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans; provided, however, any Revolving Borrowings made on the Closing Date or any of the three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date shall be made as Base Rate Loans unless the Borrower delivers a Funding Indemnity Letter not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of such Revolving Borrowing. 2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans. (a) Notice of Borrowing.  Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Term Rate Loans shall be made upon the Company&#8217;s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by: (i) telephone or (ii) a Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Loan Notice. Each such Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (or, solely with respect to clause (C) below, 4:00 p.m.) (A) two (2) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars or 48 of any conversion of Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans, (B) three (3) Business Days (or four (4) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or continuation of Alternative Currency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (C) one (1) Business Day prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that if the Borrower wishes to request Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans having an Interest Period other than one (1), three (3) or six (6) months in duration as provided in the definition of &#8220;Interest Period&#8221;, the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (x) four (4) Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of a Term SOFR Loan denominated in Dollars, or (y) five (5) Business Days (or six (6) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of such Borrower, conversion or continuation of Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Appropriate Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 11:00 a.m., (1) three (3) Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars, or (2) four (4) Business Days (or five (5) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of such Borrower, conversion or continuation of Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans and each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of an Alternative Currency Loan shall be in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000 in excess thereof (or, in connection with any conversion or continuation of a Term Loan, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding). Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Dollar Equivalent of $500,000 or a whole multiple of the Dollar Equivalent of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, in connection with any conversion or continuation of a Term Loan, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding). Each Loan Notice and each telephonic notice shall specify (I) the applicable Facility and whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Loans, as the case may be, under such Facility, (II) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (III) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (IV) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (V) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, (VI) the currency of the Loans to be borrowed, and (VII) if applicable, the Designated Borrower. If the Company fails to specify a currency in a Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, then the Loans so requested shall be made in Dollars.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that in the case of a failure to timely request a continuation of Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans, such Loans shall be continued as Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans in their original currency with an Interest Period of one (1) month. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term Rate Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Swingline Loan may not be converted to a Term Rate Loan.  Except as provided pursuant to Section 2.12(a), no Loan may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be repaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency. (b) Advances.  Following receipt of a Loan Notice for a Facility, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount (and currency) of its Applicable Percentage under such Facility of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is 49 provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Appropriate Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or continuation of Loans denominated in a currency other than Dollars, in each case as described in Section 2.02(a). In the case of a Borrowing, each Appropriate Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office for the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of any Loan in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice or, as to Loans to be made on the Closing Date as to which Advance Funding Arrangements are in effect, in accordance with the terms thereof. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the Company; provided, however, that if, on the date a Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars is given by the Borrower, there are L/C Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Borrowing, first, shall be applied to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, shall be made available to the Borrower as provided above. (c) Term Rate Loans.  Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as, or converted to or continued as Term Rate Loans without the consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the outstanding Term SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans and any or all of the then outstanding Alternative Currency Loans be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto. (d) Interest Rates.  Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. (e) Interest Periods.  After giving effect to all Term Borrowings, all conversions of Term Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Term Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than five (5) Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Term Facility. After giving effect to all Revolving Borrowings, all conversions of Revolving Loans from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Revolving Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than seven (7) Interest Periods in effect in respect of the Revolving Facility. (f) Cashless Settlement Mechanism. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all or the portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and such Lender. (g) Conforming Changes.  With respect to any Alternative Currency Daily Rate, Alternative Currency Term Rate or SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such 50 amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. (h) Rollover Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, all Rollover Revolving Loans outstanding on the Closing Date shall be permitted to continue as Eurocurrency Rate Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) solely for the duration of such Eurocurrency Loans&#8217; respective Interest Periods (as defined and set pursuant to the Existing Credit Agreement) and, upon expiration of such Interest Periods, such Rollover Revolving Loans shall be converted to Term SOFR Loans and/or a Base Rate Loans pursuant to and in accordance with the terms hereof.  It is understood and agreed that all such Rollover Revolving Loans, for the temporary period that such Loans are permitted to continue as Eurocurrency Rate Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement) in accordance with the foregoing sentence, shall otherwise be subject to all terms and conditions applicable to Term SOFR Loans, mutatis mutandis, set forth herein, including, without limitation, with respect to the Applicable Rate. 2.03 Letters of Credit. (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, in addition to the Loans provided for in Section 2.01, the Borrower may request that any L/C Issuer, in reliance on the agreements of the Revolving Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, issue, at any time and from time to time during the Availability Period, standby Letters of Credit for its own account or the account of any of its Subsidiaries in such form as is acceptable to the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer in its reasonable determination. Letters of Credit issued hereunder shall constitute utilization of the Revolving Commitments. All Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions hereof. (b) Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Extension, Reinstatement or Renewal. (i) To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment of the terms and conditions, extension of the terms and conditions, extension of the expiration date, or reinstatement of amounts paid, or renewal of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Company shall deliver (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable L/C Issuer) to an L/C Issuer selected by it and to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such later date and time as the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer may agree in a particular instance in their sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, extended, reinstated or renewed, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with clause (d) of this Section 2.03), the currency and amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof, the purpose and nature of the requested Letter of Credit and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, extend, reinstate or renew such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application and reimbursement agreement on such L/C Issuer&#8217;s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application and reimbursement agreement or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, an L/C Issuer relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control. 51 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">(ii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application (or the amendment of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the applicable L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an &#8220;Auto-Extension Letter of Credit&#8221;); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit shall permit such L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day (the &#8220;Non-Extension Notice Date&#8221;) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon by the Borrower and the applicable L/C Issuer at the time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuer to permit the extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiration date not later than the date permitted pursuant to Section 2.03(d); provided, that such L/C Issuer shall not (A) permit any such extension if (1) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its extended form under the terms hereof (except that the expiration date may be extended to a date that is no more than one (1) year from the then-current expiration date) or (2) it has received notice (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such extension or (B) be obligated to permit such extension if it has received notice (which may be in writing or by telephone (if promptly confirmed in writing)) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and in each such case directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such extension. (iii) If the Borrower so requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, any L/C Issuer may, in its sole discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the stated amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an &#8220;Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit&#8221;). Unless otherwise directed by the applicable L/C Issuer, the Borrower shall not be required to make a specific request to such L/C Issuer to permit such reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the applicable L/C Issuers to reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit permits the applicable L/C Issuer to decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a specified number of days after such drawing (the &#8220;Non-Reinstatement Deadline&#8221;), such L/C Issuer shall not permit such reinstatement if it has received a notice (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is seven (7) Business Days before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (A) from the Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such reinstatement or (B) from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied (treating such reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and, in each case, directing such L/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement. (c) Limitations on Amounts, Issuance and Amendment. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, extended, reinstated or renewed only if (and upon issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant 52 that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal (w) the aggregate amount of the outstanding Letters of Credit issued by any L/C Issuer shall not exceed its L/C Commitment, (x) the aggregate L/C Obligations shall not exceed the L/C Sublimit, (y) the Revolving Exposure of any Lender shall not exceed its Revolving Commitment and (z) the Total Revolving Exposure shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments. (i) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if: (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such L/C Issuer from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any Law applicable to such L/C Issuer or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or request that such L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or the Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer with respect to the Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such L/C Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such L/C Issuer any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it; (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such L/C Issuer applicable to letters of credit generally; (C) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer, the Letter of Credit is in an initial stated amount less than $100,000; (D) any Revolving Lender is at that time a Defaulting Lender, unless such L/C Issuer has entered into arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral, satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the Borrower or such Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer&#8217;s actual or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)) with respect to the Defaulting Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as it may elect in its sole discretion; or (E) the Letter of Credit contains any provisions for automatic reinstatement of the stated amount after any drawing thereunder. (ii) No L/C Issuer shall be under any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (A) such L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such time to issue the Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to the Letter of Credit. (d) Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall have a stated expiration date no later than the earlier of (ix) the date twelve (12) months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, whether automatic or by amendment, twelve months after the then-current expiration date of such Letter of Credit) and (x) the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. (e) Participations. 53 (i) By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount or extending the expiration date thereof), and without any further action on the part of the applicable L/C Issuer or the Lenders, such L/C Issuer hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from such L/C Issuer, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this clause (e) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, extension, reinstatement or renewal of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments. (ii) In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for account of the applicable L/C Issuer, such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of each L/C Disbursement made by an L/C Issuer not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the notice provided by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders pursuant to Section 2.03(f) until such L/C Disbursement is reimbursed by the Borrower or at any time after any reimbursement payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason, including after the Maturity Date. Such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each such payment shall be made in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.03), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable L/C Issuer the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03(f), the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable L/C Issuer or, to the extent that the Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse such L/C Issuer, then to such Lenders and such L/C Issuer as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Lender pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse an L/C Issuer for any L/C Disbursement shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Disbursement. (iii) Each Revolving Lender further acknowledges and agrees that its participation in each Letter of Credit will be automatically adjusted to reflect such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit at each time such Lender&#8217;s Commitment is amended pursuant to the operation of Sections 2.18 or as a result of an assignment in accordance with Section 11.06 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement. (iv) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.03(e), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, the applicable L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the applicable Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the applicable L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by such L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of the relevant 54 L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of any L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (e)(vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (f) Reimbursement. If an L/C Issuer shall make any L/C Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer in respect of such L/C Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such L/C Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice of such L/C Disbursement, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m. or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time, provided that, if such L/C Disbursement is not less than $500,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.02 or Section 2.04 that such payment be financed with a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower&#8217;s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof (the &#8220;Unreimbursed Amount&#8221;) and such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly upon receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount pursuant to Section 2.03(e)(ii), subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the aggregate Revolving Commitments. Any notice given by any L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(f) may be given by telephone if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. (g) Obligations Absolute. The Borrower&#8217;s obligation to reimburse L/C Disbursements as provided in clause (f) of this Section 2.03 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of: (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any Letter of Credit, or any term or provision herein or therein; (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense or other right that the Borrower or any Subsidiary may have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any L/C Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction; (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement in such draft or other document being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit; (iv) waiver by any L/C Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer&#8217;s protection and not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by such L/C Issuer which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower; 55 </FONT></DIV>

(h) Examination. The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower&#8217;s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against each L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. (i) Liability. None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any L/C Issuer, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit by the applicable L/C Issuer or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable L/C Issuer; provided that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse an L/C Issuer from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by such L/C Issuer&#8217;s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an L/C Issuer (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), an L/C Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination, and that (i) an L/C Issuer may replace a purportedly lost, stolen, or destroyed original Letter of Credit or missing amendment thereto with a certified true copy marked as such or waive a requirement for its presentation; 56 (ii) an L/C Issuer may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and without regard to any non-documentary condition in such Letter of Credit; (iii) an L/C Issuer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit; and (iv) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by an L/C Issuer when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any L/C Issuer, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of (A) any presentation that includes forged or fraudulent documents or that is otherwise affected by the fraudulent, bad faith, or illegal conduct of the beneficiary or other Person, (B) an L/C Issuer declining to take-up documents and make payment, (C) against documents that are fraudulent, forged, or for other reasons by which that it is entitled not to honor, (D) following a Borrower&#8217;s waiver of discrepancies with respect to such documents or request for honor of such documents or (E) an L/C Issuer retaining proceeds of a Letter of Credit based on an apparently applicable attachment order, blocking regulation, or third-party claim notified to such L/C Issuer. (j) Applicability of ISP and UCP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C Issuer and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued by it (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no L/C Issuer shall be responsible to the Borrower for, and no L/C Issuer&#8217;s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall be impaired by, any action or inaction of any L/C Issuer required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where any L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade &#8211; International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law &amp; Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. (k) Benefits. Each L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each L/C Issuer shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Administrative Agent in Article IX with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such L/C Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term &#8220;Administrative Agent&#8221; as used in Article IX included such L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to such L/C Issuer. (l) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the &#8220;Letter of Credit Fee&#8221;) for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any standby Letter of Credit, the amount of such 57 Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Letter of Credit Fees shall be (i) payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day following the end of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, at the time of issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand and (ii) accrued through and including the last day of each fiscal quarter in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be drawn under each standby Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, upon the request of the Required Revolving Lenders, while any Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default Rate. (m) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers. The Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per annum equal to the percentage separately agreed upon between the Borrower and such L/C Issuer, computed on the Dollar Equivalent of the daily amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit on a quarterly basis in arrears. Such fronting fee shall be due and payable no later than the tenth Business Day after the end of each fiscal quarter end in the most recently- ended quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment), commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the Maturity Date and thereafter on demand. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance with Section 1.06. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account, the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable on demand and are nonrefundable. (n) Disbursement Procedures. The L/C Issuer for any Letter of Credit shall, within the time allowed by Applicable Laws or the specific terms of the Letter of Credit following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under such Letter of Credit. Such L/C Issuer shall promptly after such examination notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of such demand for payment if such L/C Issuer has made or will make an L/C Disbursement thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such L/C Issuer and the Lenders with respect to any such L/C Disbursement. (o) Interim Interest. If the L/C Issuer for any standby Letter of Credit shall make any L/C Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Disbursement in full on the date such L/C Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such L/C Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such L/C Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to Base Rate Loans; provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such L/C Disbursement when due pursuant to clause (f) of this Section 2.03, then Section 2.08(b) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this clause (p) shall be for account of such L/C Issuer, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to clause  (f) of this Section 2.03 to reimburse such L/C Issuer shall be for account of such Lender to the extent of such payment. (p) Replacement of any L/C Issuer.  Any L/C Issuer may be replaced at any time by written agreement between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced L/C Issuer and the successor L/C Issuer. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an L/C Issuer. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(m). From and after the effective date 58 of any such replacement, (i) the successor L/C Issuer shall have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued by it thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term &#8220;L/C Issuer&#8221; shall be deemed to include such successor or any previous L/C Issuer, or such successor and all previous L/C Issuer, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an L/C Issuer hereunder, the replaced L/C Issuer shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an L/C Issuer under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. (q) Cash Collateralization. (i) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Revolving Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with L/C Obligations representing at least 66-2/3% of the total L/C Obligations) demanding the deposit of Cash Collateral pursuant to this clause (q), the Borrower shall immediately deposit into an account established and maintained on the books and records of the Administrative Agent (the &#8220;Collateral  Account&#8221;) an amount in cash equal to 105% of the total L/C Obligations as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, provided that the obligation to deposit such Cash Collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (f) of Section 8.01. Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. In addition, and without limiting the foregoing or clause (d) of this Section 2.03, if any L/C Obligations remain outstanding after the expiration date specified in said clause (d), the Borrower shall immediately deposit into the Collateral Account an amount in cash equal to 105% of such L/C Obligations as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. (ii) The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over the Collateral Account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower&#8217;s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the Collateral Account. Moneys in the Collateral Account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse each L/C Issuer for L/C Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed, together with related fees, costs, and customary processing charges, and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the L/C Obligations at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with L/C Obligations representing 66-2/3% of the total L/C Obligations), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of Cash Collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. (r) L/C Issuer Reports to the Administrative Agent. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each L/C Issuer shall, in addition to its notification obligations set forth elsewhere in this Section 2.03, provide the Administrative Agent a Letter of Credit Report, as set forth below: (i) reasonably prior to the time that such L/C Issuer issues, amends, renews, increases or extends a Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal, increase 59 </FONT></DIV>

(s) Additional L/C Issuers. Any Lender hereunder may become an L/C Issuer upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of a fully executed Notice of Additional L/C Issuer which shall be signed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and each L/C Issuer. Such new L/C Issuer shall provide its L/C Commitment in such Notice of Additional L/C Issuer and upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent of the fully executed Notice of Additional L/C Issuer, the defined term L/C Commitment shall be deemed amended to incorporate the L/C Commitment of such new L/C Issuer. (t) Letters of Credit Issued for Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse, indemnify and compensate the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter of Credit as if such Letter of Credit had been issues solely for the account of the Borrower. The Borrower irrevocably waives any and all defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor or surety of any or all of the obligations of such Subsidiary in respect of such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower&#8217;s business derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such Subsidiaries. (u) Conflict with Issuer Documents. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms hereof shall control. 2.04 Swingline Loans. (a) The Swingline. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set forth in this Section 2.04, may in its sole discretion make loans to the Company (each such loan, a &#8220;Swingline Loan&#8221;). Each such Swingline Loan may be made, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, to the Company, in Dollars, from time to time on any Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swingline Sublimit; provided, however, that (i) after giving effect to any Swingline Loan, (A) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Facility at 60 such time, (B) the Revolving Exposure of any Revolving Lender at such time shall not exceed such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Commitment and (C) the aggregate amount of all Swingline Loans advanced by any Swingline Lender outstanding shall not exceed the Swingline Commitment of the Swingline Lender, (ii) the Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swingline Loan to refinance any outstanding Swingline Loan (for the avoidance of doubt, outstanding Swingline Loans may be repaid with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan), and (iii) the Swingline Lender shall not be under any obligation to make any Swingline Loan if it shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that it has, or by such Credit Extension may have, Fronting Exposure. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company may borrow under this Section 2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest only at a rate based on the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate. Immediately upon the making of a Swingline Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swingline Lender a risk participation in such Swingline Loan in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Applicable Revolving Percentage times the amount of such Swingline Loan. (b) Borrowing Procedures. (i) Each Swingline Borrowing shall be made upon the Comnpany&#8217;s irrevocable notice to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by: (ii) telephone or (iii) a Swingline Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent of a Swingline Loan Notice. Each such Swingline Loan Notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall specify (A) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of $100,000, and (B) the requested date of the Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day). Promptly after receipt by the Swingline Lender of any Swingline Loan Notice, the Swingline Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swingline Loan Notice and, if not, the Swingline Lender will notify the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof. Unless the Swingline Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swingline Borrowing (1) directing the Swingline Lender not to make such Swingline Loan as a result of the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section 2.04(a), or (2) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Article IV is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swingline Loan Notice may, make the amount of its Swingline Loan available to the Borrower at its office by crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of the Swingline Lender in Same Day Funds. (c) Refinancing of Swingline Loans. (i) The Swingline Lender at any time in its sole discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Revolving Lender make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount of Swingline Loans then outstanding. Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Facility and the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The Swingline Lender shall furnish the Company with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice 61 promptly after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with respect to the applicable Swingline Loan) for the account of the Swingline Lender at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office for Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swingline Lender. (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, if for any reason any Swingline Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Revolving Borrowing in accordance with Section  2.04(c)(i) (including, without limitation, the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 4.02), the request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swingline Lender as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swingline Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in the relevant Swingline Loan and each Revolving Lender&#8217;s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such participation. (iii) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swingline Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i), the Swingline Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to the Swingline Lender at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Swingline Lender in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Revolving Loan included in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or funded participation in the relevant Swingline Loan, as the case may be. A certificate of the Swingline Lender submitted to any Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (c)(iii) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (iv) Each Revolving Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving Lender&#8217;s obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower of a Loan Notice). No such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to repay Swingline Loans, together with interest as provided herein. (d) Repayment of Participations. (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swingline Loan, if the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of such Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its 62 Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof in the same funds as those received by the Swingline Lender. (ii) If any payment received by the Swingline Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swingline Loan is required to be returned by the Swingline Lender under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swingline Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Swingline Lender its Applicable Revolving Percentage thereof on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the request of the Swingline Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. (e) Interest for Account of Swingline Lender. The Swingline Lender shall be responsible for invoicing the Company for interest on the Swingline Loans. Until each Revolving Lender funds its Base Rate Loan or risk participation pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Lender&#8217;s Applicable Revolving Percentage of any Swingline Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Revolving Percentage shall be solely for the account of the Swingline Lender. (f) Payments Directly to Swingline Lender. The Company shall make all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swingline Loans directly to the Swingline Lender. 2.05 Prepayments. (a) Optional. (i) The Borrower may, upon notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent pursuant to delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans and Term Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty subject to Section 3.05; provided that unless otherwise agreed by Administrative Agent (A) such notice must be received by Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (or, solely with respect to clause (3) below, 4:00 p.m.) (1) two (2) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of any Term SOFR Loan or Daily SOFR Loan denominated in Dollars, (2) three (3) Business Days (or four (4), in the case of prepayment of Loans denominated in Special Notice Currencies) prior to any date of prepayment of any Alternative Currency Loan, and (3) one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (B) any prepayment of Term SOFR Loans or Daily SOFR Loans denominated in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof; (C) any prepayment of Alternative Currency Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof, any (D) prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding.  Each such notice shall specify the date, the currency and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Term Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender&#8217;s ratable portion of such prepayment (based on such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility).  If such notice is given by the Company, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein.  Any prepayment of a Term Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Each prepayment of the outstanding Term 63 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Loans pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be applied to the principal repayment installments thereof in direct order of maturity. Subject to Section 2.15, such prepayments shall be paid to the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages in respect of each of the relevant Facilities. (ii) The Borrower may, upon notice from the Company to the Swingline Lender pursuant to delivery to the Swingline Lender of a Notice of Loan Prepayment (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily prepay Swingline Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Swingline Lender, (A) such notice must be received by the Swingline Lender and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess hereof (or, if less, the entire principal thereof then outstanding). Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. (b) Mandatory. (i) Revolving Outstandings.  If for any reason the Total Revolving Outstandings at any time exceed the Revolving Facility at such time, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Revolving Loans, Swingline Loans and L/C Borrowings, and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to such excess (together with all accrued by unpaid interest thereon); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i) unless, after the prepayment of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans, the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Revolving Facility at such time. (ii) Application of Other Payments.  Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.15, prepayments of the Revolving Facility made pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), first, shall be applied ratably to the L/C Borrowings and the Swingline Loans, second, shall be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans, and, third, shall be used to Cash Collateralize the remaining L/C Obligations; and the amount remaining, if any, after the prepayment in full of all L/C Borrowings, Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans outstanding at such time and the Cash Collateralization of the remaining L/C Obligations in full (the sum of such prepayment amounts, Cash Collateralization amounts and remaining amount being, collectively, the &#8220;Reduction Amount&#8221;) may be retained by the Borrower for use in the ordinary course of its business, and the Revolving Facility shall be automatically and permanently reduced by the Reduction Amount as set forth in Section 2.06. Upon the drawing of any Letter of Credit that has been Cash Collateralized, the funds held as Cash Collateral shall be applied (without any further action by or notice to or from the Borrower or any other Loan Party or any Defaulting Lender that has provided Cash Collateral) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuers or the Revolving Lenders, as applicable. (iii) Alternative Currencies. If the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all Loans and L/C Obligations denominated in Alternative Currencies at such time exceeds an amount equal to 105% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect, then, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrowers shall prepay Loans and/or Cash Collateralize Letters of Credit in an aggregate amount sufficient 64 to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Alternative Currency Sublimit then in effect. Within the parameters of the applications set forth above, prepayments pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and then to Term Rate Loans (and, if applicable, Daily SOFR Loans and Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loans) in direct order of Interest Period maturities.  All prepayments under this Section 2.05(b) shall be subject to Section 3.05, but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment. 2.06 Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Borrower may, upon notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Revolving Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit or from time to time permanently reduce the Revolving Facility, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit; provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $10,000,000 or any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce (A) the Revolving Facility if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings would exceed the Revolving Facility, (B) the Letter of Credit Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto, the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations not fully Cash Collateralized hereunder would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit or (C) the Swingline Sublimit if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Outstanding Amount of Swingline Loans would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit.  If after giving effect to any reduction or termination of Revolving Commitments under this Section 2.06, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Alternative Currency Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit exceeds the Revolving Facility at such time, the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Alternative Currency Sublimit or the Swingline Sublimit, as the case may be, shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such excess.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, Swingline Sublimit, the Alternative Currency Sublimit or the Revolving Commitment under this Section 2.06. The amount of any such reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall not be applied to the Alternative Currency Sublimit unless otherwise specified by the Company. Upon any reduction of the Revolving Commitments, the Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender shall be reduced by such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Revolving Percentage of such Reduction Amount. All fees in respect of the Revolving Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. (b) Payment of Fees.  All fees in respect of the Revolving Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. (c) Term Facility.  The aggregate Term Commitments shall be automatically and permanently reduced to zero (i) on the date of any Term Borrowing on a dollar-for-dollar basis equal to such Term Borrowing and (ii) to the extent undrawn and unused, on the last day of the Availability Period for the Term Facility.  In addition, during the Availability Period in respect of the Term Facility, the Company may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent as set forth above in clause (a), from time to time terminate (in whole or in part) the unused portion of the aggregate Term Commitments.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any voluntary termination or reduction of the unused portion of the aggregate Term Commitments under this Section 2.06(c). Upon any reduction of the unused portion of the aggregate Term Commitments, the Term Commitment of each Term Lender shall be reduced by such Lender&#8217;s ratable portion of such reduced amount. All fees in respect of the 65 Term Facility accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Term Facility shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. 2.07 Repayment of Loans. (a) Term Loans. The Company shall repay to the Term Lenders, on the last day of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, in an amount equal to $8,125,000 (which amount shall be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments in accordance with the order of priority set forth in Section 2.05), unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 8.02; provided, however, that (i) the final principal repayment installment of the Term Loans shall be repaid on the Maturity Date for the Term Facility and in any event shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Term Loans outstanding on such date, (ii) if any principal repayment installment to be made by the Company (other than principal repayment installments on Term SOFR Loans) shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such principal repayment installment shall be due on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be and (iii) if any principal repayment installment to be made by the Company on a Term SOFR Loan shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, such principal repayment installment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such principal repayment installment into another calendar month, in which event such principal repayment installment shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day. (b) Revolving Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Revolving Lenders on the Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding on such date. (c) Swingline Loans. The Company shall repay each Swingline Loan on the earlier to occur of (i) the date ten (10) Business Days after such Loan is made and (ii) the Maturity Date for the Revolving Facility. 2.08 Interest and Default Rate. (a) Interest.  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08(b), (i) each Term SOFR Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period from the applicable Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate for such Facility, (ii) each Base Rate Loan under a Facility shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for such Facility, (iii) each Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Alternative Currency Daily Rate plus the Applicable Rate; (iv) each Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Alternative Currency Term Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (v) if applicable, each Daily SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus the Applicable Rate, and (vi) each Swingline Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate for the Revolving Facility, and the extent that any calculation of interest or any fee required to be paid under this Agreement shall be based on (or result in) a calculation that is less than zero, such calculation shall be deemed zero for purposes of this Agreement. (b) Default Rate. 66 (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (ii) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders such amount shall thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (iii) Automatically during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(i) or (f) or, upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any other Event of Default exists, all outstanding Obligations (including Letter of Credit Fees) may accrue at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. (iv) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand. (c) Interest Payments.  Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.  Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law. (d) Interest Act (Canada). For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), (i) whenever a rate of interest or fee rate hereunder is calculated on the basis of a year (the &#8220;deemed year&#8221;) that contains fewer days than the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation, such rate of interest or fee rate shall be expressed as a yearly rate by multiplying such rate of interest or fee rate by the actual number of days in the calendar year of calculation and dividing it by the number of days in the deemed year, (ii) the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation hereunder and (iii) the rates of interest stipulated herein are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields. Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably agrees not to plead or assert, whether by way of defense or otherwise, in any proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, that the interest payable under this Agreement and the calculation thereof has not been adequately disclosed to it, whether pursuant to section 4 of the Interest Act (Canada) or any other applicable law or legal principle. 2.09 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in subsection (l) of Section 2.03: (a) Commitment Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable Revolving Percentage, a commitment fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount by which the Revolving Facility exceeds the sum of (i) the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C Obligations (the &#8220;Revolving Commitment Fee&#8221;).  The Revolving Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times during the relevant Availability Period, including at any time during which one or more of the conditions in Section 4.02 is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date and on the last day of the Availability Period for the Revolving Facility.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">addition, commencing on July 2, 2022, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Term Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage of the Term Facility, a commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily amount of the aggregate outstanding unfunded Term Commitments on and after July 2, 2022 (the &#8220;Term Commitment Fee&#8221;). The Term Commitment Fee shall accrue at all times on and after July 2, 2022 and ending on the last day of the relevant Availability Period, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after July 2, 2022, and on the last day of the Availability Period for the Term Facility.  The commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears and if there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect. (b) Other Fees. (i) The Borrower shall pay to Bank of America for its own account, in Dollars, fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letter.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. (ii) The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders, in Dollars, such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.  Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever. 2.10 Computation of Interest and Fees. (a) Computation of Interest and Fees.  All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) and Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies (other than Alternative Currency Loans with respect to EURIBOR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies (other than Canadian Dollars) as to which market practice differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice.  All other computations of fees and interest, including those with respect to Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans and Alternative Currency Loans determined by reference to EURIBOR, shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).  Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one (1) day.  Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. (b) Financial Statement Adjustments or Restatements.  If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.  If, as a 68 result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or for any other reason, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent determines that (i) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as calculated by the Borrower as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would have resulted in lower pricing for such period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly on demand by the Borrower pay to Borrower an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that were paid by Borrower to Administrative Agent for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually due for such period. This clause (b) shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer, as the case may be, under any provision of this Agreement to payment of any Obligations hereunder at the Default Rate or under Article VIII.  The Borrower&#8217;s obligations under this clause (b) shall survive the termination of the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment of all other Obligations hereunder. 2.11 Evidence of Debt. (a) Maintenance of Accounts. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender in the ordinary course of business. The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register in accordance with Section 11.06(c). The accounts or records maintained by each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender&#8217;s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto. (b) Maintenance of Records. In addition to the accounts and records referred to in Section 2.11(a), each Lender and the Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. 2.12 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent Clawback. (a) General.  All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrowers hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make 69 such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage in respect of the relevant Facility (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent, in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. Subject to Section 2.07(a) and as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement, if any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. (b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term Rate Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in  Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans or in the case of Alternative Currencies in accordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent. (c) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due. With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the &#8220;Rescindable Amount&#8221;): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by such Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment, then each of the Appropriate Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or 70 such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this clause (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. (d) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest. (e) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Term Loans and Revolving Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c). (f) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. (g) Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided herein: (i) each Borrowing (other than Swingline Borrowings) shall be made from the Appropriate Lenders, each payment of fees under Section 2.09 and clauses (l) and (m) of Section 2.03 shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders, and each termination or reduction of the amount of the Commitments shall be applied to the respective Commitments of the Lenders, pro rata according to the amounts of their respective Commitments; (ii) each Borrowing shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders according to the amounts of their respective Commitments (in the case of the making of Revolving Loans) or their respective Loans that are to be included in such Borrowing (in the case of conversions and continuations of Loans); (iii) each payment or prepayment of principal of Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Loans held by them; and (iv) each payment of interest on Loans by the Borrower shall be made for account of the Appropriate Lenders pro rata in accordance with the amounts of interest on such Loans then due and payable to the respective Appropriate Lenders. 2.13 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of (a) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities due and payable to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time in excess of its ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Obligations due and payable to such Lender at such time to (ii) the aggregate amount of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time) of payments on account of the Obligations in respect of the Facilities due and payable to all Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such time obtained by all the Lenders at such time or (b) Obligations in respect of any of the Facilities owing (but not due and payable) to such Lender hereunder and under the other Loan Documents at such 71 </FONT></DIV>

Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the amount of such participation 2.14 Cash Collateral. (a) Obligation to Cash Collateralize. At any time there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, within one Business Day following the written request of the Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall Cash Collateralize the L/C Issuers&#8217; Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender (determined after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv) and any Cash Collateral provided by such Defaulting Lender) in an amount not less than the Minimum Collateral Amount. Additionally, if the Administrative Agent notifies the Company at any time that the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations at such time exceeds 105% of the Letter of Credit Sublimit then in effect, then within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Company shall provide Cash Collateral for the Outstanding Amount of the L/C Obligations in an amount not less than the amount by which the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit. (b) Grant of Security Interest. The Borrower, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to (and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and agrees to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein, and all other property so provided as Collateral pursuant hereto, and in all proceeds of the foregoing, all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral may be applied pursuant to Section 2.14(c). If at any time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of 72 any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than the Minimum Collateral Amount, the Borrower will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (determined in the case of Cash Collateral provided pursuant to Section 2.15(a)(v), after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(v) and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America.

(ii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.15(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. (iii) Certain Fees. (A) Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee payable under Section 2.09(a) for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender) (B) Letter of Credit Fees. Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive Letter of Credit Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Applicable Revolving Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.14.

Subject to Section 11.20, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender&#8217;s increased exposure following such reallocation. (v) Cash Collateral, Repayment of Swingline Loans.

(c) New Swingline Loans/Letters of Credit. So long as any Revolving Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swingline Loan and (ii) no L/C Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, increase, reinstate or renew any letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto. 2.16 Designated Borrowers.

(ii) Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (A) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so), (B) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (C) the Administrative Agent and the Loan Parties, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or a Loan Party in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (d)(ii). (e) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority, as provided in this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. (f) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will 79 </FONT></DIV>

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender&#8217;s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. (ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower is a U.S. Person, (A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W&#8211;9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; (B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable: (1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W&#8211;8BEN&#8211;E (or W&#8211;8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the &#8220;interest&#8221; article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, IRS Form W&#8211;8BEN&#8211;E (or W&#8211;8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the &#8220;business profits&#8221; or &#8220;other income&#8221; article of such tax treaty; (2) executed copies of IRS Form W&#8211;8ECI; (3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J&#8211;1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a &#8220;bank&#8221; within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a &#8220;10 percent shareholder&#8221; of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a &#8220;U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate&#8221;) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form W&#8211;8BEN&#8211;E (or W&#8211;8BEN, as applicable); or (4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of IRS Form W&#8211;8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W&#8211;8ECI, IRS Form W&#8211;8BEN&#8211;E (or W&#8211;8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J&#8211;2 or Exhibit J&#8211;3, IRS Form W&#8211;9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more 80 direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit J&#8211;4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; (C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Administrative Agent), executed copies (or originals, as required) of any other form prescribed by Applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and (D) if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender&#8217;s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the purposes of this clause (f)(ii)(D), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (iii) Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. (g) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by Applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Loan Party or with respect to which any Loan Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it shall pay to such Loan Party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Loan Party under this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that each Loan Party, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Loan Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause (g), in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to such Loan Party pursuant to this 81 clause (g) the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This clause (g) shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to any Loan Party or any other Person. (h) Survival. Each party&#8217;s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations. 3.02 Illegality. (a) If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Relevant Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to engage in reverse repurchase of U.S. Treasury securities transactions of the type included in the determination of SOFR, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Relevant Rate purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Company (through the Administrative Agent), (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or maintain Alternative Currency Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Company shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay all Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as applicable in the affected currency or currencies or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans and Daily SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), in each case, immediately, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term Rate Loans and (B) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. (b) If, in any applicable jurisdiction, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender or any Designated Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender or its applicable Designated Lender to (i) perform any of its obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (ii) to fund, hold a commitment or maintain its participation in any Loan or Letter of Credit or 82 (iii) issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any Credit Extension to any Designated Borrower who is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States, a State thereof or the District of Columbia such Person shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, then, upon the Administrative Agent notifying the Company, and until such notice by such Person is revoked, any obligation of such Person to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest or fees with respect to any such Credit Extension shall be suspended, and to the extent required by Applicable Law, cancelled. Upon receipt of such notice, the Loan Parties shall, (A) repay that Person&#8217;s participation in the Loans or other applicable Obligations on the last day of the Interest Period for each Loan or other Obligation occurring after the Administrative Agent has notified the Company or, if earlier, the date specified by such Person in the notice delivered to the Administrative Agent (being no earlier than the last day of any applicable grace period permitted by Applicable Law), (B) to the extent applicable to the L/C Issuer, Cash Collateralize that portion of applicable L/C Obligations comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit to the extent not otherwise Cash Collateralized and (C) take all reasonable actions requested by such Person to mitigate or avoid such illegality. 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. (a) If in connection with any request for a Term SOFR Loan, Daily SOFR Loan or an Alternative Currency Loan or a conversion of Base Rate Loans to a Term SOFR Loan or an Alternative Currency Loan or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate for the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency has been determined in accordance with Section 3.03(b) and the circumstances under clause (i) of Section 3.03(b) or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred with respect to such Relevant Rate (as applicable), or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency for any determination date(s) or requested Interest Period, as applicable, with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan, Daily SOFR Loan (if applicable) or an Alternative Currency Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason that the Relevant Rate with respect to a proposed Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency for any requested Interest Period or  determination date(s) does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Company and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Loans in the affected currencies, as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans to Term SOFR Loans or Loans in the affected currencies, as applicable, shall be suspended in each case to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans, Alternative Currency Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of this Section 3.03(a), until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans and/or Alternative Currency Loans to the extent of the affected Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) (A) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans (or, if applicable, Daily SOFR Loans) shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately and (B) any outstanding affected Alternative Currency Loans, at the Company&#8217;s election, shall either (1) be converted into a 83 </FONT></DIV>

(b) Replacement of Relevant Rate or Successor Rate.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that: (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency because none of the tenors of such Relevant Rate (including any forward-looking term rate thereof) is available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or (ii) the Applicable Authority has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency (including any forward-looking term rate thereof) shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans denominated in such Agreed Currency, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such representative tenor(s) of the Relevant Rate for such Agreed Currency (the latest date on which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for such Agreed Currency (including any forward-looking term rate thereof) are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the &#8220;Scheduled Unavailability Date&#8221;);  or (iii) syndicated loans currently being executed and agented in the U.S., are being executed or amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency; If  the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(b)(i), (ii) or (iii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency or any then current Successor Rate for an Agreed Currency in accordance with this Section 3.03 at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated, as applicable, with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the U.S. and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (and any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a &#8220;Successor Rate&#8221;), and any such amendment shall become 84 effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment. The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Lender of the implementation of any Successor Rate. Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 3.04 Increased Costs. (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall: (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender or any L/C Issuer; (ii) subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (e) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or (iii) impose on any Lender or any L/C Issuer or the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or such L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or such L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, the Borrower will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or such L/C 85 Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or any L/C Issuer determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or such L/C Issuer or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s capital or on the capital of such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swingline Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s holding company for any such reduction suffered. (c) Mandatory Costs. If any Lender or any L/C Issuer incurs any Mandatory Costs attributable to the Obligations, then from time to time the Company will pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such Mandatory Costs. Such amount shall be expressed as a percentage rate per annum and shall be payable on the full amount of the applicable Obligations giving rise to such Mandatory Costs. (d) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or an L/C Issuer setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or such L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Company shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. (e) [Reserved]. (f) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or an L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender&#8217;s or such L/C Issuer&#8217;s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to compensate) such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of: 86 (a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise); (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower or the applicable Designated Borrower; or (c) any assignment of a Term Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.13; or (d) any failure by any Borrower to make payment of any Loan or drawing under any Letter of Credit (or interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; including any loss of anticipated profits, any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. The Borrower shall also pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower (or the applicable Designated Borrower) to the Lenders under this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term Rate Loan made by it at the Relevant  Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term Rate Loan was in fact so funded. 3.06 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender, any L/C Issuer, or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or any L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower, such Lender or such L/C Issuer shall, as applicable, use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender or such L/C Issuer, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may be. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay (or cause the applicable Designated Borrower to pay) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender or any L/C Issuer in connection with any such designation or assignment. (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with Section 11.13. 87 </FONT></DIV>

(a) The provisions of this Section 3.08 shall only apply in respect of any UK Borrower, and in respect of any such UK Borrower, the provisions of Section 3.01 shall not apply. (b) Tax gross-up. (i) Each UK Borrower shall make all payments to be made by it under any Loan Document without any UK Tax Deduction unless a UK Tax Deduction is required by law. (ii) A UK Borrower shall, promptly upon becoming aware that it must make a UK Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a UK Tax Deduction) notify the Administrative Agent accordingly.  Similarly, a Lender shall notify Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender.  If Administrative Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify the relevant UK Borrower. (iii) If a UK Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by a UK Borrower, the amount of the payment due from that UK Borrower shall be increased to an amount which (after making any UK Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no UK Tax Deduction had been required. (iv) A payment by a UK Borrower shall not be increased under clause (iii) above by reason of a UK Tax Deduction on account of Taxes imposed on interest by the United Kingdom if, on the date on which the payment falls due: (A) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a UK Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a UK Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a UK Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the published interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or Treaty or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (B) the relevant Lender is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of clause (a)(ii) of the definition of UK Qualifying Lender, and: (1) an officer of H.M. Revenue &amp; Customs has given (and not revoked) a direction (a &#8220;Direction&#8221;) under section 931 of the ITA which relates to the payment and that Lender has received from the UK Borrower making the payment a certified copy of that Direction; and (2) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made; or (C) the relevant Lender is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of clause (a)(ii) of the definition of UK Qualifying Lender and: 88 (1) the relevant Lender has not given a UK Tax Confirmation to the UK Borrower; and (2) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction if the Lender had given a UK Tax Confirmation to the UK Borrower, on the basis that the UK Tax Confirmation would have enabled the UK Borrower to have formed a reasonable belief that the payment was an &#8220;excepted payment&#8221; for the purpose of section 930 of the ITA; or (D) the relevant Lender is a UK Treaty Lender and the UK Borrower making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the UK Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under clause (vii) and clause (viii) below. (v) If a UK Borrower is required to make a UK Tax Deduction, that UK Borrower shall make that UK Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that UK Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.

(vii) (A) Subject to clause (vii)(B) below, a UK Treaty Lender and each UK Borrower which makes a payment to which that UK Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate as soon as reasonably practicable in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that UK Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without a UK Tax Deduction. (B) (1) A UK Treaty Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement on the day on which this Agreement is entered into that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of Administrative Agent and without liability to any UK Borrower) by confirming its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name at Schedule 1.01(b); and (2) a UK Treaty Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the day on which this Agreement is entered into that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall include an indication to that effect (for the benefit of Administrative Agent and without liability to any UK Borrower) by confirming its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in the 89 documentation which it executes on becoming a party to this Agreement as a Lender, and having done so, that Lender shall be under no obligation pursuant to clause (vii)(A) above. (viii) If a Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with Section 3.08(b)(vii)(B) above and: (A) a UK Borrower making a payment to that Lender has not made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender; or (B) a UK Borrower making a payment to that Lender has made a Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender but: (1) that Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by H.M. Revenue &amp; Customs; or (2) H.M.

(ix) If a Lender has not included an indication to the effect that it wishes the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme to apply to this Agreement in accordance with Section 3.08(b)(vii)(B) or Section 3.08(e), no UK Borrower shall make a Borrower DTTP Filing or file any other form relating to the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Lender&#8217;s advance or its participation in any advance unless the Lender otherwise agrees. (x) A UK Borrower shall, promptly on making a Borrower DTTP Filing, deliver a copy of that Borrower DTTP Filing to Agent for delivery to the relevant Lender. (xi) A UK Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify the Company and Administrative Agent if there is any change in the position from that set out in the UK Tax Confirmation. (c) Tax indemnity. (i) A UK Borrower shall (within three Business Days of demand by the Administrative Agent) pay to a UK Lender an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that UK Lender determines has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of Taxes by that Lender in respect of a Loan Document. (ii) Clause (c)(i) above shall not apply: (A) with respect to any Taxes assessed on a Lender 90 (1) under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which such Lender is treated as resident for tax purposes; or (2) under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in such jurisdiction, if such Taxes are imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income, profits or gains received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by such Lender; or (3) to the extent a loss, liability or cost: i. is compensated for by an increased payment under Section 3.08(b)(iii); or ii. would have been compensated for by an increased payment under Section 3.08(b)(iii) but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in Section 3.08(b)(iv) applied. iii. is within the scope of Section 3.08(f) or Section 3.08(g); or iv. is suffered or incurred in respect of or pursuant to, or is attributable to, any Bank Levy. (iii) A Lender making, or intending to make a claim under clause (c)(i) above shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of the event which has given, rise to the claim, following which Administrative Agent shall notify the UK Borrower.

(e) Lender Status Confirmation.  Each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement (&#8220;New Lender&#8221;) shall indicate, in the documentation which it executes on becoming a party to this Agreement, and for the benefit of Administrative Agent and without liability to any UK Borrower, which of the following categories it falls within: (i) not a UK Qualifying Lender; 91 </FONT></DIV>

If a New Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Section 3.08(e), then that New Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each UK Borrower) as if it is not a UK Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies Agent which category of UK Qualifying Lender applies.  For the avoidance of doubt, the documentation which a Lender executes on becoming a party to this Agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a New Lender to comply with this Section 3.08(e). (f) Stamp Taxes.  The UK Borrower shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Lender against any cost, loss or liability that Lender incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Loan Document, other than in respect of an assignment or transfer by a Lender. (g) Value Added Tax. (i) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party to any Lender which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply, and accordingly, subject to clause (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender to any party under a Loan Document, that party shall pay to the Lender (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (subject to such Lender issuing a valid VAT invoice to such party). (ii) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender (the &#8220;Supplier&#8221;) to any other Lender (the &#8220;Recipient&#8221;) under a Loan Document, and any party other than the Recipient (the &#8220;Subject Party&#8221;) is required by the terms of any Loan Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse the Recipient in respect of that consideration): (1) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Subject Party shall also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying such amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of such VAT.  The Recipient must (where this clause (ii)(1) applies) promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and (2) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Subject Party shall promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT. (iii) Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify a Lender for any cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Lender for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save 92 to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority. (iv) Any reference in this Section 3.08(h) to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term &#8220;representative member&#8221; to have the same meaning as in the United Kingdom Value Added Tax Act 1994). (v) In relation to any supply made by a Lender to any party under a Loan Document, if reasonably requested by such Lender, that party must promptly provide such Lender with details of that party&#8217;s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Lender&#8217;s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply. (h) Determination. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 3.08, a reference to &#8220;determines&#8221; or &#8220;determined&#8221; in connection with tax provisions contained in this Section 3.08 means a determination made in the absolute discretion of the person making the determination. (i) FATCA information. (i) Subject to clause (iii) below, each Lender and UK Borrower shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another such party: (A) confirm to that other party whether it is a FATCA Exempt Party or not a FATCA Exempt Party; (B) supply to that other party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status under FATCA as that other party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other party&#8217;s compliance with FATCA; and (C) supply to that other party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other party&#8217;s compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime. (ii) If a party confirms to another party pursuant to clause (i)(1) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that party shall notify that other party reasonably promptly. (iii) Clause (i) above shall not oblige any party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of: (A) any law or regulation; (B) any fiduciary duty; or (C) any duty of confidentiality. (iv) If a party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with clause (i)(1) or (2) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where clause (iii) above applies), then such party shall be treated for the purposes of the Loan Documents (and payments under them) as if it 93 is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information. (j) FATCA Deduction. (i) Each Lender and UK Borrower may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction. (ii) Each Lender and UK Borrower shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Borrower Agent and Agent, and Agent shall notify the other Lenders. If as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, a UK Borrower would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee under Section 3.08(b) then the assignee is only entitled to receive payment under those Sections to the same extent as the existing Lender would have been if the assignment had not occurred. 3.09 Australian Tax Matters. (a) The provisions of this Section 3.09 shall only apply in respect of any Australian Loan Party, and in respect of any such Australian Loan Party, the provisions of Section 3.01 shall not apply. (b) Tax Gross Up. (i) Each Australian Loan Party shall make all payments to be made by it under any Loan Document without any Australian Withholding Tax unless Australian Withholding Tax is required by law. (ii) An Australian Loan Party shall, promptly upon becoming aware that it must pay Australian Withholding Tax (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of Australian Withholding Tax) notify Administrative Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall notify Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. If Administrative Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify the relevant Australian Loan Party. (iii) If Australian Withholding Tax is required by law to be made by an Australian Loan Party, the Australian Loan Party shall pay an additional amount together with the payment so that after any required withholding or the making of all the required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.09(b)(iii)) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Australian Withholding Tax had been required. (iv) No additional amounts shall be paid by an Australian Loan Party under Section 3.09(b)(iii) above by reason of Australian Withholding Tax if, on the date on which the payment falls due: (A) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without Australian Withholding Tax if the Lender had been an Australian Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be an Australian Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the published interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or 94 Australian Treaty or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (B) the relevant Lender is an Australian Treaty Lender and the Australian Loan Party making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Australian Withholding Tax had that Lender complied with its obligations under Section 3.09(b)(vii) below; or (C) it relates to a FATCA Deduction, other than a FATCA Deduction required as a result of any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (v) If an Australian Loan Party is required to pay Australia Withholding Tax, that Australian Loan Party shall pay the Australian Withholding Tax and any payment required in connection with that Australian Withholding Tax within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law. (vi) Within thirty days of making either paying Australian Withholding Tax or any payment required in connection with that Australian Withholding Tax, the Australian Loan Party making that Australian Withholding Tax shall deliver to Administrative Agent evidence reasonably satisfactory to that Lender that the Australian Withholding Tax has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority. (vii) An Australian Treaty Lender and each Australian Loan Party which makes a payment to which that Australian Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Australian Loan Party to obtain authorization to make that payment without Australian Withholding Tax. (c) Tax indemnity. (i) An Australian Loan Party shall (within three Business Days of demand by the Administrative Agent) pay to a Lender an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which the Lender has (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of Taxes in respect of a Loan Document in relation to the Australian Loan Party. (ii) Section 3.09(c)(i) above shall not apply: (A) with respect to any Taxes assessed in respect of a Lender (1) under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which such Lender is treated as resident for tax purposes; or (2) under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in such jurisdiction, if such Taxes are imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by such Lender; or 95 </FONT></DIV>

(iii) A Lender making, or intending to make a claim under Section 3.09(c)(i) above shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which Administrative Agent shall notify the Australian Loan Party. (iv) A Lender shall, on receiving a payment from an Australian Loan Party under this Section 3.09(c) notify Administrative Agent. (d) Tax Credit. If an Australian Loan Party makes an Australian Tax Payment and the relevant Lender reasonably determines that: (i) a Tax Credit is attributable either to an additional payment of which that Australian Withholding Tax forms part, or to that Australian Withholding Tax in consequence of which that Australian Withholding Tax was required; and (ii) such Lender has obtained, utilized and retained that Tax Credit, in whole or in part, such Lender shall pay an amount to that Australian Loan Party which such Lender reasonably determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Australian Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Australian Loan Party. (e) Lender Status Confirmation. Each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement shall indicate, in the documentation which it executes on becoming a party to this Agreement, and for the benefit of Administrative Agent and without liability to any Australian Loan Party, which of the following categories it falls within: (i) not an Australian Qualifying Lender; (ii) an Australian Qualifying Lender (other than an Australian Treaty Lender); or (iii) an Australian Treaty Lender. If a Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Section 3.09(e), then that new Lender shall be treated 96 for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Australian Loan Party) as if it is not an Australian Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies Administrative Agent which category of Australian Qualifying Lender applies.

(f) Stamp Taxes. (i) Each Australian Loan Party shall pay or reimburse the Lender for all stamp, transaction, registration and similar Taxes on or in relation to the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of any Loan Document or any payment, receipt or other transaction contemplated by any Loan Document. (ii) Each Australian Loan Party shall indemnify the Lender against any liability resulting from delay or omission to pay those Taxes (including fines and penalties) except to the extent the liability results from failure by the Lender to pay any Tax after having been put in funds (with all necessary documents) to do so by the Borrower. (g) Goods and Services Tax (GST). (i) All payments (including the provision of any non-monetary consideration) to be made by an Australian Loan Party under or in connection with this Loan Document have been calculated without regard to GST.

(h) Determination. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 3.09, a reference to &#8220;determines&#8221; or &#8220;determined&#8221; in connection with tax provisions contained in this Section 3.09 means a determination made in the absolute discretion of the person making the determination. (i) FATCA information.

(ii) If a party confirms to another party pursuant to clause (i)(1) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that party shall notify that other party reasonably promptly. (iii) Clause (i) above shall not oblige any party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of: (A) any law or regulation; (B) any fiduciary duty; or (C) any duty of confidentiality. (iv) If a party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with clause (i)(1) or (2) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where clause (iii) above applies), then such party shall be treated for the purposes of the Loan Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

Similarly, a Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender.  If the Administrative Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify the Company. (iii) If a Dutch Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by a Dutch Borrower, the amount of the payment due from that Dutch Borrower shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Dutch Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Dutch Tax Deduction had been required. (iv) A payment by a Dutch Borrower shall not be increased under clause (iii) above by reason of a Dutch Tax Deduction on account of Taxes imposed on interest by the Netherlands if, on the date on which the payment falls due: (A) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Dutch Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Dutch Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Dutch Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or Treaty or any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or (B) the relevant Lender is a Dutch Treaty Lender and the Dutch Borrower making the payment is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender without the Dutch Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under paragraph (vii) below.

(ii) Clause (c)(i) above shall not apply: (A) with respect to any Taxes assessed on a Lender (1) under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which such Lender is treated as resident for tax purposes; (2) under the law of the jurisdiction in which such Lender&#8217;s Lending Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in such jurisdiction; (3) under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Lender has a permanent establishment and/or permanent representative to which income under this Agreement is attributed in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction; or (4) under the laws of The Netherlands to the extent that such Tax becomes payable as a result of such Lender having a substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang) in a Dutch Borrower as laid down in the Dutch Income Tax Act 2001 (Wet inkomstenbelasting 2001), if such Taxes are imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by such Lender; or (5) to the extent a loss, liability or cost: i. is compensated for by an increased payment under Section 3.10(b)(iii) (Tax gross-up); ii. would have been compensated for by an increased payment under Section 3.10(b)(iii) (Tax gross-up) but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions in Section 3.10(b)(iv) applied; iii. is compensated for by Section 3.10(f) (Stamp Taxes) or Section 3.10(g) (Value Added Tax) or would have been compensated for under those Sections but was not compensated solely because any of the exceptions set out therein applied; or iv. relates to any Bank Levy (or any payment attributable to, or liability arising as a consequence of, a Bank Levy). (iii) A Lender making, or intending to make a claim under clause (c)(i) above shall promptly notify Administrative Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which Administrative Agent shall notify the Company. 100 (d) Tax Credit.  If a Dutch Borrower makes a Dutch Tax Payment and the relevant Lender determines that: (i) a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment of which that Dutch Tax Payment forms part, or to that Dutch Tax Payment or to a Dutch Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Dutch Tax Payment was required; and (ii) such Lender has obtained, utilized and retained that Tax Credit, such Lender shall pay an amount to that Dutch Borrower which such Lender determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Dutch Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Dutch Borrower. (e) Lender Status Confirmation.  Each Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement after the date of this Agreement (&#8220;New Lender&#8221;) shall indicate, in the documentation which it executes on becoming a party to this Agreement, and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and without liability to any Dutch Borrower, which of the following categories it falls within: (i) not a Dutch Qualifying Lender; (ii) a Dutch Qualifying Lender (other than a Dutch Treaty Lender); or (iii) a Dutch Treaty Lender. If a New Lender fails to indicate its status in accordance with this Section 3.10(e), then that New Lender shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Dutch Borrower) as if it is not a Dutch Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Administrative Agent which category of Dutch Qualifying Lender applies.  For the avoidance of doubt, the documentation which a Lender executes on becoming a party to this Agreement shall not be invalidated by any failure of a New Lender to comply with this Section 3.10(e). (f) Stamp Taxes.  The Dutch Borrower shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Lender against any cost, loss or liability that Lender incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Loan Document, other than in respect of an assignment or transfer by a Lender. (g) Value Added Tax. (i) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party to any Lender which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for a supply for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply, and accordingly, subject to clause (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender to any party under a Loan Document, that party shall pay to the Lender (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of such VAT (and such Lender shall promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to such party). (ii) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender (the &#8220;Supplier&#8221;) to any other Lender (the &#8220;Recipient&#8221;) under a Loan Document, and any party other than the Recipient (the &#8220;Subject Party&#8221;) is required by the terms of any Loan Document to pay 101 an amount equal to the consideration for such supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration): (1) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Subject Party shall also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying such amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of such VAT.  The Recipient must (where this clause (ii)(1) applies) promptly pay to the Subject Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment obtained by the Recipient from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and (2) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Subject Party shall promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT. (iii) Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify a Lender for any cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Lender for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority. (iv) Any reference in this Section 3.10(g) to any party shall, at any time when such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the person who is treated as making the supply, or (as appropriate) receiving the supply under the grouping rules (as set out in Article 11 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC, as amended (or as implemented by a member state of the European Union) or any other similar provision in any jurisdiction which is not a member state of the European Union). (v) In relation to any supply made by a Lender to any party under a Loan Document, if reasonably requested by such Lender, that party must promptly provide such Lender with details of that party&#8217;s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Lender&#8217;s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply. (h) Determination. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 3.10, a reference to &#8220;determines&#8221; or &#8220;determined&#8221; in connection with tax provisions contained in this Section 3.10 means a determination made in the absolute discretion of the person making the determination. (i) FATCA information. (i) Subject to clause (iii) below, each Lender and Dutch Borrower shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another such party: (A) confirm to that other party whether it is a FATCA Exempt Party or not a FATCA Exempt Party; 102 (B) supply to that other party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status under FATCA as that other party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other party&#8217;s compliance with FATCA; and (C) supply to that other party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other party&#8217;s compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime. (ii) If a party confirms to another party pursuant to clause (i)(i)(A) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that party shall notify that other party reasonably promptly. (iii) Clause (i) above shall not oblige any Lender to do anything, and clause (i)(C) above shall not oblige any other party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of: (A) any law or regulation; (B) any fiduciary duty; or (C) any duty of confidentiality. (iv) If a party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with clause (i)(B) or (C) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where clause (C) above applies), then such party shall be treated for the purposes of the Loan Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information. (j) FATCA Deduction. (i) Solely for the purposes of clause 3.10(j), &#8220;FATCA&#8221; shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. (ii) Each Lender and Dutch Borrower may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction. (iii) If a Dutch Borrower is required by law to make a FATCA Deduction as a result of a change in law in relation to FATCA, the amount of the payment due from that Dutch Borrower shall be increased to an amount which (after making any FATCA Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no FATCA Deduction had been required. (iv) Each Lender and Dutch Borrower shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall notify the other Lenders. 103 </FONT></DIV>

Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; or &#8220;Lenders&#8221; shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial, advisory, underwriting or other business with any Loan Party or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or to provide notice to or consent of the Lenders with respect thereto. 9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. (a) The Administrative Agent or the Arrangers, as applicable, shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers, as applicable, and its Related Parties: (i) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing; 130 (ii) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and (iii) shall not have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, to any Lender or any L/C Issuer any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to, or in possession of, the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates in any capacity, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein. (b) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary), or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 11.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or an L/C Issuer. (c) Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its Related Parties have any duty or obligation to any Lender or participant or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent. 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or such L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or such L/C Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts. For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in Section 4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its objections. 9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article IX shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the Facilities as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. (a) Notice. The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the &#8220;Resignation Effective Date&#8221;), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that in no event shall any successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. (b) Effect of Resignation. With effect from the Resignation Effective Date (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any cash collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuers under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such cash collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (ii) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retired Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and each L/C Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as 132 provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor&#8217;s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section 9.06). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article IX and Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (A) while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent and (B) after such resignation for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, (1) acting as collateral agent or otherwise holding any cash collateral security on behalf of any of the Lenders and (2) in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent. (c) L/C Issuers and Swingline Lender. Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.06 shall also constitute its resignation as an L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender. If Bank of America resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c). If Bank of America resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment by the Company of a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as applicable, (ii) the retiring L/C Issuer and Swingline Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, and (iii) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue Letters of Credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect to such Letters of Credit. 9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent nor the Arrangers has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers hereafter taken, including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any Arranger to any Lender or each L/C Issuer as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent or any Arranger have disclosed material information in their (or their Related Parties&#8217;) possession.  Each Lender and each L/C Issuer represents to the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and 133 creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties.

(a) In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuers and the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.03(h) and (i), 2.09, 2.10(b) and 11.04) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and (ii) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 134 and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and each L/C Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the L/C Issuers, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09, 2.10(b) and 11.04. (b) Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or any L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or any L/C Issuer to authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or any L/C Issuer or in any such proceeding. 9.10 Guaranty Matters.

ARTICLE X CONTINUING GUARANTY 10.01 Guaranty. Each Guarantor hereby absolutely and unconditionally, jointly and severally guarantees, as a primary obligor and as a guaranty of payment and performance and not merely as a guaranty of 136 collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of any and all of the Obligations when due and payable, whether for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, damages, costs, expenses or otherwise, of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Parties, arising hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including all renewals, extensions, amendments, refinancings and other modifications thereof and all costs, attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses incurred by the Guaranteed Parties in connection with the collection or enforcement thereof) (for each Guarantor, subject to the proviso in this sentence, its &#8220;Guaranteed Obligations&#8221;); provided that the liability of each Guarantor individually with respect to this Guaranty shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law or other Applicable Law.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guaranteed Obligations shall include any such indebtedness, obligations and liabilities, or portions thereof, which may be or hereafter become unenforceable or compromised or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under any proceeding or case commenced by or against any debtor under any Debtor Relief Laws.  The Administrative Agent&#8217;s books and records showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding.  This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the enforceability of this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire to the enforceability of this Guaranty in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing. 10.02 Rights of Lender. Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Guaranteed Parties may, at any time and from time to time, to the extent permitted herein and in the Loan Documents without notice or demand, take the following actions without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness of this Guaranty:  (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any security for the payment of this Guaranty or any Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders in their sole discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Obligations.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, solely with respect to the enforceability of this Guaranty, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of such Guarantor under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of such Guarantor. 10.03 Certain Waivers. Each Guarantor waives each of the following with respect to the enforceability of this Guaranty: (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower or any other guarantor, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guaranteed Party) of the liability of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (b) any defense based on any claim that such Guarantor&#8217;s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower or any other Loan Party; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting any Guarantor&#8217;s liability hereunder; (d) any right to proceed against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, proceed against or exhaust any security for the Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Guaranteed Party whatsoever; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Guaranteed Party; and (f) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses or benefits 137 that may be derived from or afforded by applicable Law limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties.  Each Guarantor expressly waives with respect to the enforceability of this Guaranty all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Obligations. 10.04 Obligations Independent. The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against each Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other person or entity is joined as a party. 10.05 Subrogation. No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until all of the Obligations and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full and the Commitments and the Facilities are terminated.  If any amounts are paid to a Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Guaranteed Parties to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured. 10.06 Termination; Reinstatement. This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty (when due and payable) of all Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or a Guarantor is made, or any of the Guaranteed Parties exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by any of the Guaranteed Parties in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Guaranteed Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of each Guarantor under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty. 10.07 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against a Guarantor or the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor, jointly and severally, immediately upon demand by the Guaranteed Parties. 10.08 Condition of Borrower. Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Borrower and any other guarantor such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Borrower and any such other guarantor as such 138 Guarantor requires, and that none of the Guaranteed Parties has any duty, and such Guarantor is not relying on the Guaranteed Parties at any time, to disclose to it any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of the Borrower or any other guarantor (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Guaranteed Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same). 10.09 Appointment of Borrower. Each of the Guarantors (other than the Company) hereby appoints the Company to act as its agent for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and agrees that (a) the Company may execute such documents on behalf of such Guarantor as the Company deems appropriate in its sole discretion and each Guarantor shall be obligated by all of the terms of any such document executed on its behalf, (b) any notice or communication delivered by the Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or a Lender to the Company shall be deemed delivered to each Guarantor and (c) the Administrative Agent, L/C Issuer or the Lenders may accept, and be permitted to rely on, any document, instrument or agreement executed by the Company on behalf of each Guarantor. 10.10 Right of Contribution. The Guarantors agree among themselves that, in connection with payments made hereunder, each Guarantor shall have contribution rights against the other Guarantors as permitted under Applicable Law. 10.11 Keepwell.

No consent shall be required for any assignment except to the extent required by clause (b)(i)(B) of this Section 11.06 and, in addition: (A) the consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default specified in Sections 8.01(a) or 8.01(f) has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Company shall be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received notice thereof; (B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (1) any unfunded Term Commitment or any Revolving Commitment if such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender with a Commitment in respect of the applicable Facility, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or (2) any Term Loan to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; and (C) the consent of each L/C Issuer and the Swingline Lender shall be required for any assignment in respect of the Revolving Facility. (iv) Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. (v) No Assignment to Certain Persons.  No such assignment shall be made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrower&#8217;s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated by or for the primary benefit of one or more natural Persons). (vi) Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or sub-participations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent, any L/C 148 Issuer or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swingline Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this clause (b)(vi), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs. (vii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11.06(c), from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05 and 11.04 with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment); provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender&#8217;s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this clause (b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.06(d). (viii) If (as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment occurs), a UK Borrower would be obliged to make a payment to the assignee under Section 3.08, then the assignee is only entitled to receive payment under that Section to the same extent as the existing Lender would have been if the assignment had not occurred. (c) Register.  The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent&#8217;s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and interest amounts) of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#8220;Register&#8221;). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender (with respect to such Lender&#8217;s interest only), at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. (d) Participations. (i) Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of one or more natural Persons, a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower&#8217;s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a &#8220;Participant&#8221;) in all or a portion of such Lender&#8217;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the 149 Loans (including such Lender&#8217;s participations in L/C Obligations and/or Swingline Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender&#8217;s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender&#8217;s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 11.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participations (ii) Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 3.01(e) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 11.06; provided that such Participant (A) shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 11.13 as if it were an assignee under clause (b) of this Section 11.06 and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#8217;s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and interest amounts) of each Participant&#8217;s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the &#8220;Participant Register&#8221;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103&#8211;1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. (e) Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note or Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal 150 Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (f) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender after Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time any L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender assigns all of its Revolving Commitment and Revolving Loans pursuant to clause (b) above, such L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender may, (i) upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to the Administrative Agent, the Company and the Lenders, resign as an L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon thirty (30) days&#8217; notice to the Company, resign as Swingline Lender. In the event of any such resignation as an L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, the Company shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Company to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of the applicable L/C Issuer or the applicable Swingline Lender as an L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be. If Bank of America resigns as an L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as an L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swingline Lender, it shall retain all the rights of the Swingline Lender provided for hereunder with respect to Swingline Loans made by it and outstanding as of the effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C Issuer and/or Swingline Lender, (A) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swingline Lender, as the case may be, and (B) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the applicable retiring L/C Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the applicable retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 11.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. (a) Treatment of Certain Information.  Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its Affiliates, its auditors and its Related Parties on a need-to-know basis (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) (in which case the disclosing party agrees, to the extent practicable and permitted by Applicable Law (including laws relating to disclosures to banking examiners or regulatory authorities), to notify the Company promptly prior to such disclosure), (iii) to the extent required by Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (iv) to any other party hereto, (v) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 11.07, to (A) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (B) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties) to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments hereunder or prospective assignee or Participant, in reliance on this clause (vi)), (vii) on a confidential basis to (A) any rating agency in connection with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided hereunder or (B) the provider of any Platform or other electronic delivery service used 151 </FONT></DIV>

For purposes of this Section 11.07, &#8220;Information&#8221; means all information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, provided that, in the case of information received from the Borrower or any Subsidiary after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 11.07 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Commitments. (b) Non-Public Information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the L/C Issuers acknowledges that (i) the Information may include material non-public information concerning a Loan Party or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with Applicable Law, including United States federal and state securities Laws. (c) Press Releases. The Loan Parties and their Affiliates agree that they will not in the future issue any press releases or other public disclosure using the name of the Administrative Agent or any Lender or their respective Affiliates or referring to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, unless (and only to the extent that) the Loan Parties or such Affiliate is required to do so under law and then, in any event the Loan Parties or such Affiliate will consult with such Person before issuing such press release or other public disclosure. (d) Customary Advertising Material. Neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall publish any advertising material relating to the transactions contemplated hereby using the name, product photographs, logo or trademark of the Loan Parties without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 11.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each L/C Issuer and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, after obtaining the prior written consent of the Required Lenders to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender, such L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, such L/C Issuer or 152 such Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, such L/C Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured, secured or unsecured, or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or such L/C Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (a) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.15 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the Lenders, and (b) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender, each L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section 11.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have under Applicable Law. Each Lender and each L/C Issuer agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 11.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by Applicable Law (including without limitation, the Criminal Code (Canada)) (the &#8220;Maximum  Rate&#8221;).  If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower.  In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder. 11.10 Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent or any L/C Issuer, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. 11.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.  Such representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and 153 shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding. 11.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions.  The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, any L/C Issuer or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited. 11.13 Replacement of Lender. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that: (a) the Borrower shall have paid (or caused a Designated Borrower to pay) to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 11.06(b); (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the outstanding principal of its Loans and L/C Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower or applicable Designated Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; (d) such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Laws; and (e) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. The Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 154 Each party hereto agrees that (i) an assignment required pursuant to this Section 11.13 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (ii) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to an be bound by the terms thereof; provided, that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender, provided further that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.13 to the contrary, (A) any Lender that acts as an L/C Issuer may not be replaced hereunder at any time it has any Letter of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to such Lender (including the furnishing of a backstop standby letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by an issuer, reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer or the depositing of Cash Collateral into a Cash Collateral account in amounts and pursuant to arrangements reasonably satisfactory to such L/C Issuer) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letter of Credit and (B) the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 9.06. 11.14 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc. (a) GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
