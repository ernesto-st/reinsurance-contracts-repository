<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">hereto from the other party under the provisions of this <U>Article XI</U>, the Indemnified Party shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any
such claim of which it has knowledge which is covered by this indemnity to be forwarded to the Indemnitor. Any notice of a claim by reason of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement shall refer to the
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, document or instrument executed hereunder or in connection herewith upon which such claim is based and describe in reasonable detail, the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and the
amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the claim. In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and absolute right after the
receipt of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or
damage indemnified against hereunder; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnified Party may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its expense. Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate fully with the
other party in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or demand and to make available to the other party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in such party&#146;s possession
or under such party&#146;s control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the other party. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnified Party defends against or otherwise deals with
any such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel, at the expense of the Indemnitor, and control the defense of such proceeding; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Indemnitor shall be obligated pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;11.5</U> to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnified Party may settle any such proceeding which settlement obligates the other party to pay money, to perform obligations
or to admit liability without the consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, the Indemnitor may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), settle any such proceeding or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is or would reasonably be expected to be a party and indemnity
was or would reasonably be expected to be sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability on claims that are the
subject matter of such action, suit or proceedings and (ii)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party shall refuse to consent to
the settlement of any third Person claim, so long as only money damages are involved and there is no admission of liability or wrongdoing with respect to the Indemnified Party, the liability of the Indemnitor in respect of such third Person claim
shall not exceed the amount for which the third Person claim could have been settled plus the amount of expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party prior to the time of and in connection with the proposed settlement to which it is entitled to
indemnification. After any final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been
consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the Indemnitor
notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party by wire transfer, certified or bank cashier&#146;s check within 30 days after the date of such notice.
