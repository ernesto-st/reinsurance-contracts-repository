enforceability of any Letter of Credit, any other Loan Document or any Bond
Document; (ii) any amendment or waiver of or any consent to or departure from
any Loan Document or any Bond Document; (iii) the existence of any claim, set -
off, counterclaim, defense or other rights which the Borrower, any Obligated
Party, or any other Person may have at any time against any beneficiary of any
Letter of Credit, the Agent, any Bank, or any other Person, whether in
connection with any Loan Document, any Bond Document or any unrelated
transaction; (iv) any statement, draft, or other documentation presented under
any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid, or insufficient
in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
respect whatsoever;


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>
or (v) any other circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing; provided that Reimbursement Obligations with respect to a Letter of
Credit may be subject to avoidance by the Borrower if the Borrower proves in a
final nonappealable judgment that it was damaged and that such damage arose
directly from the Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining
whether the documentation presented under the Letter of Credit in question
complied with the terms thereof.

      Section 4.9. Issuer Responsibility. The Borrower assumes all risks of the
acts or omissions of any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit with respect to its
use of such Letter of Credit. Neither the Agent, any Bank nor any of their
respective officers or directors shall have any responsibility or liability to
the Borrower or any other Person for: (a) the failure of any draft to bear any
reference or adequate reference to any Letter of Credit, or the failure of any
documents to accompany any draft at negotiation, or the failure of any Person to
surrender or to take up any Letter of Credit or to send documents apart from
drafts as required by the terms of any Letter of Credit, or the failure of any
Person to note the amount of any instrument on any Letter of Credit, each of
which requirements, if contained in any Letter of Credit itself, it is agreed
may be waived by the Agent; (b) errors, omissions, interruptions, or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages; (c) the validity, sufficiency, or
genuineness of any draft or other document, or any endorsement(s) thereon, even
if any such draft, document or endorsement should in fact prove to be in any and
all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent, or forged or any statement
therein is untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or (d) any other circumstance
whatsoever in making or failing to make any payment under a Letter of Credit.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Borrower shall have a claim against the Agent,
and the Agent shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any direct, but
not indirect, consequential or punitive, damages suffered by the Borrower which
the Borrower proves in a final nonappealable judgment were caused by (i) the
Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents
presented under any Letter of Credit complied with the terms thereof or (ii) the
Agent's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation to
it of documentation strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such
Letter of Credit. The Agent may accept documents that appear on their face to be
in order, without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary.

</TABLE>

Any notices of the type described in this Section 6.3 which are received by the
Agent after 12:30 p.m. on a Business Day shall be deemed to be received and
shall be effective on the next Business Day. Each such notice of termination or
reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall specify the amount of the Revolving
Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing,
Conversion, Continuation, or prepayment shall: (a) specify the Loans to be
borrowed or prepaid or the Accounts to be Converted or Continued; (b) the amount
(subject to Section 6.2 hereof) to be borrowed, Converted, Continued, or
prepaid; (c) in the case of a Conversion, the Type of Account to result from
such Conversion; (d) in the case of a borrowing the Type of Account or Accounts
to be applicable to such borrowing and the amounts thereof; (e) in the event a
Eurodollar Account is selected, the duration of the Interest Period therefor;
and (f) the date of borrowing, Conversion, Continuation, or prepayment (which
shall be a Business Day). Each notice of borrowing, Conversion, continuation, or
prepayment shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit "I" hereto. The Agent
shall notify the Banks of the contents of each such notice on the date of the
Agent's receipt of the same or, if received on or after 12:30 p.m. on a Business
Day, on the next Business Day. In the event the Borrower fails to select the
Type of Account applicable to a Loan, or the duration of any Interest Period for
any Eurodollar Account, within the time period and otherwise as provided in this
Section 6.3, such Account (if outstanding as a Eurodollar Account) will be
automatically Converted into a Base Rate Account on the last day of the
preceding Interest Period for such Account or (if outstanding as a Base Rate
Account) will remain as, or (if not then


                                    Page 25
<PAGE>
outstanding) will be made as, a Base Rate Account. The Borrower may not borrow
any Loans subject to a Eurodollar Account, Convert any Base Rate Accounts into
Eurodollar Accounts, or Continue any Eurodollar Account as a Eurodollar Account
if the Applicable Rate for such Eurodollar Accounts would exceed the Maximum
Rate or if a Default exists.

      Section 6.4. Prepayments.

            (a) Mandatory.

                  (i) Revolving Loans. If at any time the Outstanding Revolving
Credit exceeds the Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, within one (1) Business
Day after the occurrence thereof prepay the Revolving Loans by the amount of the
excess together with any amount due under Section 7.5 or if no Revolving Loans
are outstanding and the Outstanding Revolving Credit exceeds the Borrowing Base,
immediately pledge to the Agent cash or cash equivalents in an amount equal to
the excess as security for the Obligations.

                  (ii) Term Loan.

                        (A) Prepayment from Excess Cash Flow. The Borrower
shall, within ninety (90) days after the end of each Fiscal Year, beginning with
the Fiscal Year ending September 30, 2003, prepay the Term Loan as of such date
in an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) 50% of Excess Cash Flow (as
defined below) for such Fiscal Year or (ii) Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($750,000). For purposes of this Section 6.4(a)(ii)(A), "Excess Cash Flow"
means, for any Fiscal Year, the sum of: (i) EBITDA; minus (ii) cash taxes paid;
minus (iii) cash interest expense (including the interest portion of Capital
Lease Obligations); minus (iv) scheduled principal payments on Debt; minus (v)
Capital Expenditures (except Capital Expenditures financed with the Term Loan or
other Debt permitted by Section 11.1 other than the Revolving Loans); plus (vi)
any non-operating, nonrecurring, or extraordinary gains or revenue actually
received in cash to the extent excluded in determining Consolidated Net Income
or EBITDA.

                        (B) Prepayments from Asset Dispositions. The Borrower
shall, within five (5) days of receipt of Net Proceeds related to an Asset
Disposition prepay the Term Loan as of such date in an amount equal to the Net
Proceeds of such Asset Disposition. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower,
the Parent or any Subsidiary, as applicable, may retain proceeds otherwise
required to be delivered in accordance with the foregoing from an Asset
Disposition if: (1) no Default exists and (2) (x) if the Person disposing of the
asset in question reasonably expects the proceeds of such Asset Disposition to
be reinvested in productive assets then used or useable in its business within
ninety (90) days after receipt of such proceeds or (y) in case of proceeds
received due to loss, damage, destruction or condemnation, the Person, within
ninety (90) days after receipt of such proceeds, delivers to the Agent a plan,
acceptable to the Agent, to be used for rebuilding, repairing or replacing such
assets. For purposes of this Section 6.4(a)(ii)(B) the following terms shall
have the following meanings:

            "Asset Disposition" means the disposition whether by sale, lease,
      transfer, loss, damage, destruction, condemnation or otherwise of any
      assets of the Parent or any of the Subsidiaries other than (i) sales of
      inventory in the ordinary course of business and (ii) sales of assets
      permitted under either clause (b) or clause (c) of Section 11.8.

            "Net Proceeds" means cash proceeds (including casualty insurance
      proceeds paid with respect to damage to property) received by the Parent
      or any of the Subsidiaries from any Asset Disposition (including payments
      under notes or other debt securities received in connection with any Asset
      Disposition and insurance proceeds and


                                    Page 26
<PAGE>
      awards of condemnation), net of (a) the costs of such sale, lease,
      transfer or other disposition (including professional fees and expenses
      and taxes attributable to such sale, lease or transfer which are actually
      expected to be paid) and (b) amounts applied to repayment of Debt (other
      than the Obligations) secured by a Lien on the asset disposed.

                        (C) Prepayment from Securities Offerings. In the event
that the Parent or any Subsidiary issues any Securities (as defined below), no
later than the third (3rd) Business Day following the date of receipt of the
proceeds from any such issuance, the Borrower shall prepay the Term Loan in an
amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the proceeds of such issuance, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions and other reasonable costs associated
therewith. For purposes of this Section 6.4(a)(ii)(C) the term "Securities"
means any stock, shares, options, warrants, voting trust certificates, or other
instruments evidencing an ownership interest or a right to acquire an ownership
interest in a Person or any bonds, debentures, notes or other evidences of
indebtedness, secured or unsecured. This Section 6.4(a)(ii)(C) shall not apply
where an issuance of Securities is permitted under either Section 11.6 (i) or
Section 11.6(ii).

Each prepayment under Section 6.4(a) shall be accompanied with accrued and
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid to the date of prepayment and any amounts
payable under Section 7.5 and each prepayment under Section 6.4(a)(ii) shall be
applied to the installments of principal due under the Term Loan in the inverse
order of maturity.

            (b) Optional. Subject to Section 6.2 and the provisions of this
clause (b), the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time without premium
or penalty upon prior notice to the Agent as specified in Section 6.3, prepay or
repay any Loan in full or in part. Any optional prepayment of the Term Loan
shall be accompanied with accrued interest on the amount prepaid to the date of
prepayment and any partial prepayments thereof shall be applied to the principal
installments due in the inverse order of maturity. Loans subject to a Eurodollar
Account may be prepaid or repaid only on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto unless (i) the Borrower pays to the Agent for the account of
the applicable Banks any amounts due under Section 7.5 as a result of such
prepayment or repayment or (ii) after giving effect to such prepayment or
repayment the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Accounts applicable
to the Loan being prepaid or repaid having Interest Periods that end after such
payment date shall be equal to or less than the principal amount of such Loan
after such prepayment or repayment.

      Section 6.5. Method of Payment. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, all payments of principal, interest, and other amounts to be made by the
Borrower or any Obligated Party under the Loan Documents shall be made to the
Agent at the Principal Office for the account of each Bank's Applicable Lending
Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds, without setoff, deduction,
or counterclaim, not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date on which such payment
shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be
deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day). The Borrower and
each Obligated Party shall, at the time of making each such payment, specify to
the Agent the sums payable under the Loan Documents to which such payment is to
be applied (and in the event that the Borrower fails to so specify, or if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent may apply such
payment and any proceeds of any Collateral to the Obligations in such order and
manner as the Required Banks may elect in their sole discretion, subject to
Section 6.6 hereof). Each payment received by the Agent under any Loan Document
for the account of a Bank or other Secured Party shall be paid to such Bank or
other Secured Party by 3:00 p.m. on the date the payment is deemed made to the
Agent in immediately available funds, for the account, in the case of a Bank, of
such Bank's Applicable Lending Office. Whenever any payment under any Loan
Document shall be stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, such
payment may be made on the next


                                    Page 27
<PAGE>
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of the payment of interest and commitment fee, as
the case may be.

      Section 6.6. Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein: (a) each Loan shall be made by the Banks, each payment of commitment
fees under Section 2.5 shall be made for the account of the Banks, and each
termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the
Revolving Commitments of the Banks, pro rata according to their respective
Commitment Percentages; (b) the making, Conversion, and Continuation of Accounts
of a particular Type (other than Conversions provided for by Section 7.4) shall
be made pro rata among the Banks holding Accounts of such Type according to
their respective Commitment Percentages; (c) each payment and prepayment of
principal of or interest on Loans or Reimbursement Obligations shall be made to
the Agent for the account of the Agent or the Banks holding such Loans or
participation interests in the Reimbursement Obligations, as applicable, pro
rata in accordance with the respective unpaid principal amounts of such Loans,
Reimbursement Obligations or participation interests held by such Banks; (d)
proceeds of Collateral shall be shared first, by each of the Agent and the Banks
pro rata in accordance with the respective unpaid amounts of the Obligations
then due the Agent and each such Bank and the respective aggregate amount
available for drawing under all outstanding Letters of Credit which Agent or
such Bank is obligated to fund until paid in full or fully cash collateralized
and then shall be shared with any other Secured Party pro rata in accordance
with the amount of the Obligations owed to each; and (e) the Banks (other than
the Agent) shall purchase from the Agent participations in the Letters of Credit
to the extent of their respective Commitment Percentages. If at any time
payment, in whole or in part, of any amount distributed by the Agent hereunder
is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Agent as a
preference, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise under any bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar law, then each Person receiving any portion of such
amount agrees, upon demand, to return the portion of such amount it has received
to the Agent.

      Section 6.7. Sharing of Payments. If a Bank shall obtain payment of any
principal of or interest on any of the Obligations due to such Bank hereunder
directly (and not through the Agent) through the exercise of any right of set -
off, banker's lien, counterclaim, or similar right, or otherwise, it shall
promptly purchase from the other Banks participations in the Obligations held by
the other Banks in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to
time as shall be equitable to the end that all the Banks shall share the benefit
of such payment pro rata in accordance with the unpaid principal of and interest
on the Obligations then due to each of them. To such end, all of the Banks shall
make appropriate adjustments among themselves (by the resale of participations
sold or otherwise) if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Bank so
purchasing a participation in the Obligations held by the other Banks may
exercise all rights of set - off, banker's lien, counterclaim, or similar rights
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct holder
of Obligations in the amount of such participation. Nothing contained herein
shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the right of
any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such right with
respect to any other indebtedness or obligation of the Borrower.

      Section 6.8. Non - Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Agent shall
have been notified by a Bank or the Borrower (the "Payor") prior to the date on
which such Bank is to make payment to the Agent hereunder or the Borrower is to
make a payment to the Agent for the account of one or more of the Banks, as the
case may be (such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which
notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make
the Required Payment to the Agent, the Agent may assume that the Required
Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not
be required to), make the amount thereof available to the intended recipient on
such date and, if the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the
Agent, (a) the recipient of such payment shall, on demand, pay to the Agent the
amount made available to it together with interest thereon


                                    Page 28
<PAGE>
in respect of the period commencing on the date such amount was so made
available by the Agent until the date the Agent recovers such amount at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such period and (b) the
Agent shall be entitled to offset against any and all sums to be paid to such
recipient, the amount calculated in accordance with the foregoing clause (a).

      Section 6.9. Withholding Taxes. All payments by the Borrower of amounts
payable under any Loan Document shall be payable without deduction for or on
account of any present or future taxes, duties, or other charges levied or
imposed by the United States of America or by the government of any jurisdiction
outside the United States of America or by any political subdivision or taxing
authority of or in any of the foregoing through withholding or deduction with
respect to any such payments (but excluding any tax imposed on or measured by
the net income or profit of a Bank pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized or in which the principal office or Applicable Lending
Office of such Bank is located or any subdivision thereof or therein). If any
such taxes, duties, or other charges are so levied or imposed, the Borrower will
make additional payments in such amounts so that every net payment of amounts
payable by it under any Loan Document, after withholding or deduction for or on
account of any such present or future taxes, duties, or other charges, will not
be less than the amount provided for herein or therein, provided that the
Borrower may withhold to the extent required by law and shall have no obligation
to pay such additional amounts to any Bank to the extent that such taxes,
duties, or other charges are levied or imposed by reason of the failure or
inability of such Bank to comply with the provisions of Section 6.10. The
Borrower shall furnish promptly to the Agent for distribution to each affected
Bank, as the case may be, official receipts evidencing any such withholding or
reduction.

      Section 6.10. Withholding Tax Exemption. Each Foreign Bank agrees that it
will deliver to the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of the
appropriate United States Internal Revenue Service form, certifying that such
Bank is entitled to receive payments from the Borrower under any Loan Document
without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each
Foreign Bank which so delivers such form further undertakes to deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent two (2) additional copies of such form (or a successor
form) on or before the date such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered
by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that
such Foreign Bank is entitled to receive payments from the Borrower under any
Loan Document without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any change in
treaty, law, or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such
delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable
or which would prevent such Foreign Bank from duly completing and delivering any
such form with respect to it and such Foreign Bank advises the Borrower and the
Agent that it is not capable of receiving such payments without any deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax.

      Section 6.11. Participation Obligations Absolute; Failure to Fund
Participation. The obligations of a Bank to fund its participation in the
Letters of Credit in accordance with the terms hereof shall be absolute,
unconditional and irrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with
the terms of the Loan Documents under all circumstances whatsoever, including
without limitation, the following circumstances: (a) any lack of validity of any
Loan Document; (b) the occurrence of any Default; (c) the existence of any
claim, set - off, counterclaim, defenses or other rights which such Bank, the
Borrower, any Obligated Party, or any other Person may have; (d) the occurrence
of any event that has or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; (e) the failure of any condition to a Loan or the issuance of a Letter
of Credit under Article 8 hereof to be satisfied; (f) the fact that after giving
effect to the funding of the participation the Outstanding Revolving Credit may
exceed the Borrowing Base; or (g) any other circumstance whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing; provided that, the obligations of a Bank to
fund its participation in a Letters of Credit may be


                                    Page 29
<PAGE>
subject to avoidance by a Bank if such Bank proves in a final nonappealable
judgment that it was damaged and that such damage arose directly from the
Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether (i) the
conditions set forth in Article 8 hereof to the issuance of the Letter of Credit
in question were satisfied at the time of such issuance or (ii) the
documentation presented under the Letter of Credit in question complied with the
terms thereof. If a Bank fails to fund its participation in a Letter of Credit
as required hereby, such Bank shall, subject to the foregoing proviso, remain
obligated to pay to the Agent the amount it failed to fund on demand together
with interest thereon in respect of the period commencing on the date such
amount should have been funded until the date the amount was actually funded to
the Agent at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such
period and the Agent shall be entitled to offset against any and all sums to be
paid to such Bank hereunder the amount due the Agent under this sentence.

                                   ARTICLE 7.

                         Yield Protection and Illegality

      Section 7.1. Additional Costs.

            (a) The Borrower shall pay directly to each Bank from time to time
such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it for any
reasonable costs incurred by such Bank which such Bank determines are directly
attributable to its making or maintaining of any Loans subject to Eurodollar
Accounts hereunder or its obligation to make any of such Loans hereunder, or any
reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of any such
Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts
receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), resulting from any
Regulatory Change which:

                  (i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to
such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any of such Loans
(other than franchise taxes and taxes imposed on the overall net income of such
Bank or its Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans by the United States
of America or the jurisdiction in which such Bank has its Principal Office or
such Applicable Lending Office);

                  (ii) imposes or modifies any reserve (other than the Reserve
Requirement), special deposit, minimum capital, capital ratio, or similar
requirement relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any
deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Bank (including any
of such Loans or any deposits referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Rate"
in Section 1.1 hereof); or

                  (iii) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or
the Notes or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or commitments and
which results in additional cost or expense to the Bank.

Each Bank will notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle such Bank to
compensation pursuant to this Section 7.1(a) as promptly as practicable after it
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation, and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the Loans affected by such
event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Bank, violate any law,
rule, or regulation or be in any way disadvantageous to such Bank. Each Bank
will furnish the Borrower with a certificate setting forth the basis and the
amount of each request of such Bank for compensation under this Section 7.1(a).
If any Bank requests compensation from the Borrower under this subsection
Section 7.1(a), the Borrower may, by notice to such Bank (with a copy to the
Agent)


                                    Page 30
<PAGE>
suspend the obligation of such Bank to make Loans subject to Eurodollar Accounts
or Continue Eurodollar Accounts as Eurodollar Accounts or Convert Base Rate
Accounts into Eurodollar Accounts until the Regulatory Change giving rise to
such request ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 7.4
hereof shall be applicable with respect to such Eurodollar Accounts).

            (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.1, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank
either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the excess above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on the
Loans subject to Eurodollar Accounts is determined as provided in this Agreement
or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which
includes Loans subject to Eurodollar Accounts or (ii) becomes subject to
restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it
may hold, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Agent), the obligation of such Bank to make Loans subject to Eurodollar
Accounts or Continue Eurodollar Accounts as Eurodollar Accounts or Convert Base
Rate Accounts into Eurodollar Accounts hereunder shall be suspended until the
Regulatory Change giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which
case the provisions of Section 7.4 hereof shall be applicable).

            (c) Determinations and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this
Section 7.1 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its costs of maintaining
its obligation to make Loans or of making or maintaining Loans or on amounts
receivable by it in respect of the Loans, and of the additional amounts required
to compensate such Bank in respect of any Additional Costs, shall, absent
manifest error, be conclusive, provided that such determinations and allocations
are made on a reasonable basis.

      Section 7.2. Limitation on Eurodollar Accounts. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, if with respect to any Eurodollar Accounts under a
Loan for any Interest Period therefor:

            (a) The Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
that quotations of interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the
definition of "Eurodollar Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof are not being provided in
the relative amounts or for the relative maturities for purposes of determining
the rate of interest for the Loans subject to such Eurodollar Accounts as
provided in this Agreement; or

            (b) Required Banks determine (which determination shall be
conclusive) and notify the Agent that the relevant rates of interest referred to
in the definition of "Adjusted Eurodollar Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof on the
basis of which the rate of interest for such Loans for such Interest Period is
to be determined do not accurately reflect the cost to the Banks of making or
maintaining such Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof specifying the
relevant Eurodollar Account and the relevant amounts or periods, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Banks shall be under no obligation to make
additional Loans subject to a Eurodollar Account or to Convert Base Rate
Accounts into Eurodollar Accounts and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Accounts,
either prepay the Loans subject to such Eurodollar Accounts or Convert such
Eurodollar Accounts into Base Rate Accounts in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. Determinations made under this Section 7.2 shall be made on a
reasonable basis.

      Section 7.3. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable
Lending Office to (a) honor its obligation to make Loans subject to a Eurodollar
Account hereunder or (b) maintain Loans subject to a Eurodollar Account
hereunder, then such Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the
Agent) thereof and such


                                    Page 31
<PAGE>
Bank's obligation to make or maintain Loans subject to a Eurodollar Account and
to Convert Base Rate Accounts into Eurodollar Accounts hereunder shall be
suspended until such time as such Bank may again make and maintain Loans subject
to a Eurodollar Account (in which case the provisions of Section 7.4 hereof
shall be applicable).

      Section 7.4. Treatment of Affected Loans. If the Accounts applicable to a
Loan of any Bank (hereinafter called "Affected Accounts") are to be Converted
pursuant to Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 hereof, the Bank's Affected Accounts
shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Accounts on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) (or, in the case of a Conversion required by
Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.3 hereof, on such earlier date as such Bank may
specify to the Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such
Bank gives notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section
7.1 or Section 7.3 hereof which gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:
(a) to the extent that such Bank's Affected Accounts have been so Converted, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to such
Bank's Affected Accounts shall be applied instead to its Base Rate Accounts; and
(b) all Accounts which would otherwise be established or Continued by such Bank
as Eurodollar Accounts shall be made as or Converted into Base Rate Accounts and
all Accounts of such Bank which would otherwise be Converted into Eurodollar
Accounts shall be Converted instead into (or shall remain as) Base Rate
Accounts. If such Bank gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent)
that the circumstances specified in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 hereof which gave
rise to the Conversion of such Bank's Affected Accounts pursuant to this Section
7.4 no longer exist (which such Bank agrees to do promptly upon such
circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Accounts are
outstanding, such Bank's Base Rate Accounts shall be automatically Converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
Eurodollar Accounts to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect
thereto, all Accounts held by the Banks holding Eurodollar Accounts and by such
Bank are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, Types, and Interest Periods) in
accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages.

      Section 7.5. Compensation. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank, upon the request of such Bank, such amount or amounts as
shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such Bank) to compensate it
for any loss, cost, or expense incurred by it as a result of:

            (a) Any payment or prepayment of a Loan subject to a Eurodollar
Account or Conversion of a Eurodollar Account for any reason (including, without
limitation, the acceleration of the outstanding Loans pursuant to Section
13.2(a)) on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period for the

Convert a Base Rate Account to a Eurodollar Account on the date for such
borrowing, Conversion, or prepayment specified in the relevant notice of
borrowing, prepayment, or Conversion under this Agreement.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such compensation shall
include an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest
which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so paid or Converted
or not borrowed for the period from the date of such payment, Conversion, or
failure to borrow to the last day of the Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Account (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such
Eurodollar Account which would have commenced on the date specified for such
borrowing) at the applicable rate of interest for such Eurodollar Account
provided for herein over (ii) the interest component of the amount such Bank

      Section 7.6. Capital Adequacy. If after the date hereof, any Bank shall
have determined that any Regulatory Change has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Bank's (or its parent's) capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereby
to a level below that which such Bank (or its parent) could have achieved but
for such adoption, implementation, change, or compliance (taking into
consideration such Bank's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from time to time, within ten
(10) Business Days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), the
Borrower shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Bank (or its parent) for such reduction. A certificate of such
Bank claiming compensation under this Section 7.6 and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive,
provided that the determination thereof is made on a reasonable basis. In
determining such amount or amounts, such Bank may use any reasonable averaging
and attribution methods. With respect to each demand by a Bank under this
Section 7.6, no Bank shall have the right to demand compensation for amounts
attributable to any reduction in such Bank's rate of return occurring at any
time before the date which is six (6) months prior to the date the Bank gives
such demand for compensation to the Borrower.

or cause to be delivered to the Agent lender's title insurance policies issued
by title insurers satisfactory to the Agent (the "Mortgage Policies") in form
and substance and in amounts satisfactory to the Agent assuring the Agent that
the Mortgages which cover properties owned in fee simple are valid and
enforceable first priority mortgage liens on the respective Mortgaged Property

                                    Page 44

whichever applicable, shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary, as
promptly as possible (and in any event within sixty (60) days after such
designation) deliver to the Agent a fully executed Mortgage, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent together with title insurance policies,
surveys, appraisals, environmental reports and other documentation required by
this Section 10.10, provided, however, that the Agent may only designate real
property or leasehold interests as Additional Mortgaged Property if the fair
market value of the real property or leasehold interest is equal to or greater
than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) except such limitation shall not
restrict the Agent, if permitted under the Bond Documents, from designating the
interests of the Borrower, Parent or any Subsidiary in the property located in
Manning, South Carolina that as of the Closing Date is owned by Asset Holdings
Corporation IX as Additional Mortgaged Property. The Borrower agrees that,
following the taking of the actions with respect to any Additional Mortgaged
Property required by the immediately preceding sentence, the Agent shall have a

applicable law, the Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered from time to
time to the Agent a current appraisal of each Mortgaged Property and each
Additional Mortgaged Property, such appraisals to be in form and substance
satisfactory to the Agent.

reasonable basis to believe that there may be a material violation of any
Environmental Laws by, or any material liability arising thereunder of, the
Borrower, the Parent or any Subsidiary or related to any Mortgaged Property or
Additional Mortgaged Property or real property adjacent to any Mortgaged
Property or Additional Mortgaged Property, then the Borrower agrees, upon the
written request of the Agent to provide the Agent with such environmental
reports and assessments, certificates, engineering studies or other written
material or data as the Agent may reasonably require relating thereto. If the
Agent at any time has reasonable basis to believe that there may be a violation
of any Environmental Laws by, or any liability arising thereunder of, the
Borrower, the Parent or any Subsidiary or related to any real property owned,
leased or operated by the Borrower, the Parent or any Subsidiary (other than the
Mortgaged Property) or


                                    Page 45

reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, then the Borrower agrees,

environmental reports and assessments, certificates, engineering studies or

Remedial Action is necessary with respect to the Borrower, the Parent or any

other action as the Agent may reasonably require to cure, or protect against,
any material violation or potential violation of any Environmental Laws or any
material actual or potential Environmental Liability.

ownership of a Person in accordance with the restrictions set forth in Section

with respect to a merger into a Subsidiary, the surviving Person is or becomes a

or to obtain the surrender of, any outstanding warrants, options, or other
rights to acquire shares of any class of stock (or other equity interest) of the
Parent or any Subsidiary now or hereafter outstanding; except that if no Default
exists or would result therefrom, Subsidiaries may make, declare and pay
dividends and make other distributions with respect to their capital stock (or
other equity interest) for the sole purpose of enabling the Parent to pay the
actual cash taxes of the Parent attributable to the earnings of the
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not be deemed to
prohibit the Borrower from making payments at any time to pay the Parent's
expenses incurred in the ordinary course of the Parent's and the Borrower's
businesses and such payments may be made to the Parent or on behalf of the
Parent.

      Section 11.5. Investments. The Parent will not, and will not permit any of

payments may be made to the Parent or on behalf of the Parent.

the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not be deemed to prohibit the

payments may be made to the Parent or on behalf of the Parent.

exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in the aggregate during any

      Section 11.11. Prepayment of Debt. Except for optional redemptions

of the Subsidiaries to, prepay or optionally redeem any Debt other than the

not permit the Subsidiaries to, take any action or omit to take any action with
respect to the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds, any earnings and profits from
the investment thereof, or any amounts expected to be used to pay (or pledged as
security for) principal thereof or interest thereon which if taken or omitted,
respectively, would result in constituting any Bond an "arbitrage bond" within
the meaning of Section 148 of the Code or otherwise adversely affect any
exemption from federal income tax of interest on any Bond under the Code.

                                   ARTICLE 12.

Obligated Party shall not, within said period of thirty (30) days, or such
longer period during which execution of the same shall have been stayed, appeal
therefrom and cause the execution thereof to be stayed during such appeal.

            (i) The Borrower or any Obligated Party shall fail to pay when due
any principal of or interest on any Debt if the aggregate principal amount of
the affected Debt equals or exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($250,000) (other than the Obligations), or the maturity of any such Debt shall
have been accelerated, or any such Debt shall have been required to be prepaid
prior to the stated maturity thereof or any event shall have occurred with
respect to any Debt in the aggregate principal amount equal to or in excess of
Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) that permits (or, with the giving
of notice or lapse of time or both, would permit) any holder or holders of such
Debt or any Person acting on behalf of such holder or holders to accelerate the
maturity thereof or require any such prepayment.

            (j) This Agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect or
shall be declared null and void or the validity or enforceability thereof shall
be contested or challenged by the Borrower or any Obligated Party or the
Borrower or any Obligated Party shall deny that it has any further liability or
obligation under any of the Loan Documents or Bond Documents, or any lien or
security interest created by the Loan Documents shall for any reason (other than
the negligence of the Agent or the release thereof in accordance with the Loan
Documents) cease to be a valid, first priority perfected security interest in
and lien upon any of the Collateral purported to be covered thereby.

            (k) Any of the following events shall occur or exist with respect to
the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate: (i) any Prohibited Transaction involving
any Plan or Multiemployer Plan; (ii) any Reportable Event with respect to any
Plan; (iii) the filing under Section 4041 of ERISA of a notice of intent to
terminate any Plan or the termination of any Plan; (iv) any event or
circumstance that might constitute grounds entitling the PBGC to institute
proceedings under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or for the
appointment of a trustee to administer, any Plan, or the institution by the PBGC
of any such proceedings; or (v) complete or partial withdrawal under Section
4201 or 4204 of ERISA from a Multiemployer Plan or the reorganization,
insolvency, or termination of any Multiemployer Plan; and in each case above,
such event or condition, together with all other events or conditions, if any,
have subjected or could reasonably be expected to subject the Borrower to any
tax, penalty, or other liability to a Plan, a Multiemployer Plan, the PBGC, or
otherwise (or any combination thereof) which in the aggregate exceed or could
reasonably be expected to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).

            (l) Any Person or group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2)
of the Exchange Act) shall become after the Closing Date the direct or indirect
beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d - 3 under the Exchange Act) of more
than 20% of the total voting power of all classes of capital stock then
outstanding of the Parent entitled (without regard to the occurrence of any
contingency) to vote in elections of directors of the Parent.

            (m) The Agent shall reasonably determine that the Borrower's ability
to perform its obligations under this Agreement is materially impaired as a
result of: (i) any event of default under any Bond Document or (ii) any
representation or warranty made by the Borrower in any Bond Document having been
false, misleading, or erroneous in any material respect when made.

      Section 13.2. Remedies. If any Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, the Agent shall, if directed by Required Banks, do any one or more
of the following:

            (a) Acceleration. By notice to the Borrower, declare all outstanding
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes and all other amounts
payable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents immediately due and payable,
and the same shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, without further
notice, demand, presentment, notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration, notice
of


                                    Page 56
<PAGE>
intent to accelerate, protest, or other formalities of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

            (b) Termination of Commitments. Terminate the Commitments without
notice to the Borrower (however substantially contemporaneously with the
termination of the Commitments, the Agent agrees to promptly notify the Borrower
that the Commitments have been terminated, provided, that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such termination).

            (c) Judgment. Reduce any claim to judgment from a court of law.

            (d) Foreclosure. Foreclose or otherwise enforce any Lien granted to
the Agent for the benefit of itself and the other Secured Parties to secure
payment and performance of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the
Loan Documents.

            (e) Rights. Exercise any and all rights and remedies afforded by the
laws of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction, by any of the Loan
Documents, (including any of the Bond Documents which rights include, without
limitation, the right to give notice of an Event of Default to the trustees of
the Bonds) by equity, or otherwise.

Provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under Section
13.1(e) or Section 13.1(f), the Commitments of all of the Banks shall
automatically terminate, and the outstanding principal of and accrued and unpaid
interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Borrower under the
Loan Documents shall thereupon become immediately due and payable without
notice, demand, presentment, notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration, notice
of intent to accelerate, protest, or other formalities of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

      Section 13.3. Performance by the Agent. If the Borrower or any Obligated
Party shall fail to perform any covenant or agreement in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents, the Agent may, at the direction of Required Banks,
perform or attempt to perform such covenant or agreement on behalf of the
Borrower or the applicable Obligated Party. In such event, the Borrower shall,
at the request of the Agent, promptly pay any amount reasonably expended by the
Agent or the Banks in connection with such performance or attempted performance
to the Agent at the Principal Office, together with interest thereon at the
applicable Default Rate from and including the date of such expenditure to but
excluding the date such expenditure is paid in full. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is expressly agreed that neither the Agent nor any Bank shall have
any liability or responsibility for the performance of any obligation of the
Borrower or any Obligated Party under any Loan Document.

      Section 13.4. Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Secured Party is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, without notice to the Borrower or any Obligated Party (any such notice
being hereby expressly waived by the Borrower and each Obligated Party), to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general, time, demand, provisional, or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Secured
Party to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Obligated Party
against any and all of the Obligations, irrespective of whether or not the Agent
or such Secured Party shall have made any demand under such Loan Documents and
although such Obligations may be unmatured. Each Secured Party agrees promptly
to notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) after any such setoff and
application; provided, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application. The rights and remedies of each Secured
Party hereunder are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of setoff) which such Secured Party may have.


                                    Page 57

      Section 13.5. Continuance of Default. For purposes of all Loan Documents,
a Default shall be deemed to have continued and exist until the Agent shall have
actually received evidence satisfactory to the Agent that such Default shall
have been remedied.

      Section 13.6. Cash Collateral. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Borrower shall, if requested by the Agent or Required
Banks, pledge to the Agent as security for the Obligations (but excluding the
Obligations arising in connection with the Bond L/Cs) an amount in immediately
available funds equal to the then outstanding Commercial L/C Liabilities, such
funds to be held in a cash collateral account at the Agent without any right of
withdrawal by the Borrower.

                                   ARTICLE 14.

                                    The Agent

      Section 14.1. Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank hereby
appoints and authorizes JPMorgan to act as its agent hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the Agent
by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto (and continues its appointment made under the
Prior Credit Agreement). Neither the Agent nor any of its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, attorneys, or agents shall be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them hereunder or otherwise in connection with
any Loan Document or any of the other Loan Documents except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, the Agent: (i) may treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof until it receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof
signed by such payee and in form satisfactory to the Agent; (ii) shall have no
duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Loan
Documents, and shall not by reason of any Loan Document be a trustee or
fiduciary for any Secured Party; (iii) shall not be required to initiate any
litigation or collection proceedings under any Loan Document except to the
extent requested by Required Banks; (iv) shall not be responsible to the Secured
Parties for any recitals, statements, representations, or warranties contained
in any Loan Document, or any certificate or other documentation referred to or
provided for in, or received by any of them under, any Loan Document, or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, enforceability, or sufficiency of any Loan
Document or any other documentation referred to or provided for therein or for
any failure by any Person to perform any of its obligations thereunder; (v) may
consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants, and other experts
selected by it and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted to be
taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel,
accountants, or experts; and (vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect
of any Loan Document by acting upon any notice, consent, certificate, or other
instrument or writing believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the
proper party or parties. As to any matters not expressly provided for by any
Loan Document, the Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with instructions signed by
Required Banks, and such instructions of Required Banks and any action taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Secured Parties;
provided, however, that the Agent shall not be required to take any action which
exposes it to personal liability or which is contrary to any Loan Document or
applicable law.

      Section 14.2. Rights of Agent as a Bank. With respect to its Commitments,
the Loans made by it and the Notes issued to it, JPMorgan (and any successor
acting as the Agent) in its capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as
though it were not acting as the Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall,
unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual
capacity. The Agent and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor
to any Secured Party) accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under
indentures of, provide merchant banking services to, and generally engage in any
kind of banking, trust, or other business with the Borrower or any Obligated
Party, and any other Person who


                                    Page 58
<PAGE>
may do business with or own securities of the Borrower or any Obligated Party,
all as if it were not acting as the Agent and without any duty to account
therefor to the Secured Parties.

      Section 14.3. Defaults. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of a Default (other than the non - payment of principal
of or interest on the Loans or of commitment fees) unless the Agent has received
notice from a Bank or the Borrower specifying such Default and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice of the occurrence of a Default, the Agent shall give prompt notice
thereof to the Banks (and shall give each Bank prompt notice of each such non -
payment). The Agent shall (subject to Section 14.1) take such action with
respect to such Default as shall be directed by Required Banks, provided that
unless and until the Agent shall have received such directions, the Agent may
(but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable and in the best
interest of the Secured Parties.

      Section 14.4. Indemnification. THE BANKS HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY THE
AGENT FROM AND HOLD THE AGENT HARMLESS AGAINST (TO THE EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED
UNDER SECTION 15.1 AND SECTION 15.2, BUT WITHOUT LIMITING THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE
BORROWER UNDER SECTION 15.1 AND SECTION 15.2), RATABLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR
RESPECTIVE COMMITMENT PERCENTAGES, ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES,
DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, DEFICIENCIES, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES
(INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES), AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY, OR ASSERTED AGAINST THE
AGENT IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING OUT OF THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT, ANY
OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED TO BE TAKEN BY THE AGENT
UNDER OR IN RESPECT OF THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS;
PROVIDED, THAT NO BANK SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY PORTION OF THE FOREGOING TO THE
EXTENT CAUSED BY THE AGENT'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT. WITHOUT
LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE BANKS THAT THE
AGENT SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER FROM AND HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ALL OF SUCH
LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS,
DEFICIENCIES, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES),
AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RESULTING FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF THE AGENT. WITHOUT
LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS SECTION 14.4, EACH BANK AGREES TO REIMBURSE
THE AGENT PROMPTLY UPON DEMAND FOR ITS PRO RATA SHARE (CALCULATED ON THE BASIS
OF THE COMMITMENTS PERCENTAGES) OF ANY AND ALL OUT - OF - POCKET EXPENSES
(INCLUDING ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES) INCURRED BY THE AGENT IN CONNECTION
WITH THE PREPARATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, ADMINISTRATION, MODIFICATION,
AMENDMENT, OR ENFORCEMENT (WHETHER THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OR
OTHERWISE) OF, OR LEGAL ADVICE IN RESPECT OF RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER,
THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE AGENT
IS NOT REIMBURSED FOR SUCH EXPENSES BY THE BORROWER.

      Section 14.5. Independent Credit Decisions. Each Bank agrees that it has
independently and without reliance on the Agent or any other Bank, and based on
such documentation and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis of the Borrower and decision to enter into any Loan Document and
that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Bank, and based upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate
at the time, continue to make its


                                    Page 59
<PAGE>
own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under any Loan
Document. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, the Agent shall not
be required to keep itself informed as to the performance or observance by the
Borrower or any Obligated Party of any Loan Document or to inspect the
properties or books of the Borrower or any Obligated Party. Except for notices,
reports, and other documents and information expressly required to be furnished
to the Banks by the Agent hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, the Agent
shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Secured Party with any
credit or other financial information concerning the affairs, financial
condition, or business of the Borrower or any Obligated Party (or any of their
Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agent or any of its
Affiliates.

      Section 14.6. Several Commitments. The Commitments and other obligations
of the Banks under any Loan Document are several. The default by any Bank in
making a Loan in accordance with its Revolving Commitment shall not relieve the
other Banks of their obligations under any Loan Document. In the event of any
default by any Bank in making any Loan, each nondefaulting bank shall be
obligated to make its Loan but shall not be obligated to advance the amount
which the defaulting Bank was required to advance hereunder. No Bank shall be
responsible for any act or omission of any other Bank.

      Section 14.7. Successor Agent. Subject to the appointment and acceptance
of a successor Agent as provided below, the Agent may resign at any time by
giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Borrower, and the Agent may be
removed at any time by Required Banks if it has breached its obligations under
the Loan Documents. Upon any such resignation or removal, Required Banks will
have the right to appoint a successor Agent with the Borrower's consent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor Agent shall have been so
appointed by Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within
thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent's giving of notice of resignation or
the Required Banks' removal of the retiring Agent, then the retiring Agent may,
on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial
bank organized under the laws of the United States of America or any State
thereof and having combined capital and surplus of at least One Hundred Million
Dollars ($100,000,000). Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with
all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, contractual obligations, and duties
of the resigning or removed Agent, and the resigning or removed Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations under the Loan Documents. After any
Agent's resignation or removal as Agent, the provisions of this Article 14 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was the Agent.

                                   ARTICLE 15.

                                  Miscellaneous

      Section 15.1. Expenses. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay on demand: (a)
all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Banks arising in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, and delivery of the Loan Documents and all
amendments or other modifications to the Loan Documents or the Bond Documents,
including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel
for the Agent and the Banks; (b) all costs and expenses of the Agent and the
Banks in connection with any Default and the enforcement of any Loan Document or
Bond Document, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of legal
counsel for the Agent and each of the Banks (including the allocated costs of in
house counsel); (c) all transfer, stamp, documentary, or other similar taxes,
assessments, or charges levied by any Governmental Authority in respect of any
Loan Document; (d) all costs, expenses, assessments, and other charges incurred
in connection with any filing, registration, recording, or perfection of any
security interest or Lien contemplated by any Loan Document; and (e) all other
costs and expenses incurred by the Agent and the Banks in connection with any
Loan Document or Bond Document,


                                    Page 60
<PAGE>
including, without limitation, all costs, expenses, and other charges incurred
in connection with obtaining any audit, appraisal survey, environmental
assessment, title insurance or lien search in respect of the Collateral.

      Section 15.2. Indemnification. THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY THE AGENT AND
EACH BANK AND EACH AFFILIATE THEREOF AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,
EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, AND AGENTS FROM, AND HOLD EACH OF THEM HARMLESS AGAINST,
ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS,
DISBURSEMENTS, COSTS, AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND
EXPENSES) TO WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY BECOME SUBJECT WHICH DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISE FROM OR RELATE TO (A) THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE,
ADMINISTRATION, OR ENFORCEMENT OF THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE LOAN
DOCUMENTS, (B) ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE PRIOR CREDIT
AGREEMENT OR THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, (C) ANY BREACH BY THE BORROWER OR ANY OBLIGATED
PARTY OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT, OR OTHER AGREEMENT CONTAINED IN
THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, (D) THE PRESENCE,
RELEASE, THREATENED RELEASE, DISPOSAL, REMOVAL, OR CLEANUP OF ANY HAZARDOUS
MATERIAL LOCATED ON, ABOUT, WITHIN, OR AFFECTING ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS
OF THE BORROWER OR ANY SUBSIDIARY, OR (E) ANY INVESTIGATION, LITIGATION, OR
OTHER PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY THREATENED INVESTIGATION,
LITIGATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING; PROVIDED THAT
THE PERSON ENTITLED TO BE INDEMNIFIED UNDER THIS SECTION 15.2 SHALL NOT BE
INDEMNIFIED FROM OR HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ANY LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS,
DAMAGES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS, DISBURSEMENTS, COSTS, OR EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF
OR RESULTING FROM ITS GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OR BREACH OF ITS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY PROVISION OF THE
PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE
PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH PERSON TO BE INDEMNIFIED UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE
INDEMNIFIED FROM AND HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ANY AND ALL LOSSES, LIABILITIES,
CLAIMS, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS, DISBURSEMENTS, COSTS, AND EXPENSES
(INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES AND EXPENSES) ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING
FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH PERSON.

      Section 15.3. Limitation of Liability. None of the Agent, any Bank, or any
Affiliate, officer, director, employee, attorney, or agent thereof shall have
any liability with respect to, and the Borrower and, by the execution of the
Loan Documents to which it is a party, each Obligated Party, hereby waives,
releases, and agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special,
indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages suffered or incurred by
the Borrower or any Obligated Party in connection with, arising out of, or in
any way related to any of the Loan Documents or Bond Documents, or any of the
transactions contemplated by any of the Loan Documents or Bond Documents.

      Section 15.4. No Duty. All attorneys, accountants, appraisers, and other
professional Persons and consultants retained by the Agent or any Bank shall
have the right to act exclusively in the interest of the Agent and the Banks and
shall have no duty of disclosure, duty of loyalty, duty of care, or other duty
or obligation of any type or nature whatsoever to the Borrower or any of the
Borrower's shareholders or any other Person.


                                    Page 61
<PAGE>
      Section 15.5. No Fiduciary Relationship. The relationship between the
Borrower and the Obligated Parties on the one hand and the Agent and each Bank
on the other is solely that of debtor and creditor, and neither the Agent nor
any Bank has any fiduciary or other special relationship with the Borrower or
any Obligated Parties, and no term or condition of any of the Loan Documents
shall be construed so as to deem the relationship between the Borrower and the
Obligated Parties on the one hand and the Agent and each Bank on the other and
any Bank to be other than that of debtor and creditor.

      Section 15.6. Equitable Relief. The Borrower recognizes that in the event
the Borrower or any Obligated Party fails to pay, perform, observe, or discharge
any or all of the obligations under the Loan Documents, any remedy at law may
prove to be inadequate relief to the Agent and the Banks. The Borrower therefore
agrees that the Agent and the Banks, if the Agent or the Required Banks so
request, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any
such case without the necessity of proving actual damages.

      Section 15.7. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure on the part of
the Agent or any Bank to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of
dealing with respect to, any right, power or privilege under any Loan Document
or Bond Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege under any Loan Document or
Bond Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies provided for in
the Loan Documents or the Bond Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights and remedies provided by law.

      Section 15.8. Successors and Assigns.

            (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that (i) neither the Borrower nor the Parent may assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of each Bank (and any attempted assignment or transfer by
the Borrower or the Parent without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii)
no Bank may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder
except in accordance with this Section 15.8. Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants (to the extent provided in this Section 15.8(c)) and, to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent and the
Banks, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.

            (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in Section 15.8(b)(ii),
any Bank (the "Assigning Bank") may assign to one or more Persons (each an
"Assignee") all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitments and
the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                  (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower
shall be required for an assignment to a Bank, an Affiliate of a Bank, an
Approved Fund (as defined below) or, if an Event of Default under Section
13.1(a), Section 13.1(e), or Section 13.1(f) has occurred and is continuing, any
other Assignee; and

                  (B) the Agent, provided that no consent of the Agent shall be
required for an assignment of any Commitment to an Assignee that is a Bank with
a Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.


                                    Page 62



<PAGE>
                  (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

                        (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Bank or an
Affiliate of a Bank or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
Assigning Bank's Commitments or Loans of any Class, the amount of the
Commitments or Loans of the Assigning Bank subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less than Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) unless each of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise consent,
provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of
Default under Section 13.1(a), Section 13.1(e), or Section 13.1(f) has occurred
and is continuing;

                        (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the Assigning Bank's rights and
obligations under this Agreement; provided that this Section 15.8(b)(ii)(B)
shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all
the Assigning Bank's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of
Commitments or Loans;

                        (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as
defined below), an Assignment and Acceptance, together with the Notes subject to
such assignment, and a processing and recordation fee of Three Thousand Dollars
($3,000) payable by the Assigning Bank or Assignee (and not the Borrower),
provided, that such fee shall not be payable to the Agent if the Assigning Bank
is making an assignment to one of its Affiliates;

                        (D) the Assignee, if it shall not be a Bank, shall
deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; and

                        (E) in the case of an assignment to a CLO (as defined
below), the Assigning Bank shall retain the sole right to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided that the
Assignment and Acceptance between such Assigning Bank and such CLO may provide
that such Assigning Bank will not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
15.11(b) that affects such CLO.

            For the purposes of this Section 15.8(b), the terms "Approved Fund"
and "CLO" have the following meanings:

            "Approved Fund" means (a) a CLO and (b) with respect to any Bank
that is a fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any
other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is
managed by the same investment advisor as such Bank or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor.

            "CLO" means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing
in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and is administered or managed by a Bank or an Affiliate of such Bank.

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
Section 15.8(b)(v), from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Bank under this Agreement, and the Assigning
Bank thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Acceptance, be released


                                    Page 63
<PAGE>

from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the Assigning Bank's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Assigning Bank shall cease to be a party hereto but shall
continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.9, Article 7, Section 15.1
and Section 15.2). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 15.8
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Bank of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 15.8(c).

                  (iv) The Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Banks, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the
Loans, each Bank pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower,
the Agent, the Bank that issues any Letter of Credit and the Banks may treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower,
the Bank that issues any Letter of Credit and any Bank, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an Assigning Bank and an Assignee, the Assignee's
completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a
Bank hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section
15.8(b)(ii)(C) and any written consent to such assignment required by Section
15.8(b)(i), the Agent shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this Section 15.8(b)(v).

            (c) (i) Any Bank may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a
"Participant") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (A) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (B) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Borrower, the Agent and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations
under the Loan Documents. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank
sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole
right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the
Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver regarding any of the
following actions to the extent that it would affect the Participant: (1) any
increase of such Bank's Commitments, (2) any reduction of the principal amount
of, or interest to be paid on, the Loans or other Obligations of such Bank, (3)
any reduction of any commitment fee, or other amount payable to such Bank under
any Loan Document, (4) any postponement of any date for the payment of any
amount payable in respect of the Loans or other Obligations of such Bank, or (5)
the release of Borrower, any Obligated Party or any material portion of the
Collateral. Subject to Section 15.8(c)(ii), the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.9 and Article 7 to
the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to Section 15.8(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 13.4 as though it were a Bank,
provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 6.7 as though it were
a Bank.

                  (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 6.9 and Article 7 than the applicable Bank would
have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with


                                    Page 64
<PAGE>

the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Bank
if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.9 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 6.10
as though it were a Bank.

            (d) Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section 15.8 shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Bank from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto.

            (e) Any Bank may, in connection with any assignment or participation
or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 15.8, disclose
to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any
information relating to the Parent or the Subsidiaries furnished to such Bank by
or on behalf of the Parent or the Subsidiaries.

      Section 15.9. Survival. All representations and warranties made in any
Loan Document or in any document, statement, or certificate furnished in
connection with any Loan Document shall survive the execution and delivery of
the Loan Documents and no investigation by the Agent or any Bank or any closing
shall affect the representations and warranties or the right of the Agent or any
Bank to rely upon them. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
obligation of the Borrower hereunder, the obligations of the Borrower under
Article 7 and Sections 15.1 and 15.2 shall survive repayment of the Notes and
termination of the Commitments.

      Section 15.10. Entire Agreement; Amendment and Restatement. THIS
AGREEMENT, THE NOTES, AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS REFERRED TO HEREIN EMBODY THE
FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND SUPERSEDE ANY AND ALL PRIOR
COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRIOR CREDIT
AGREEMENT), REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERSTANDINGS, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL,
RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS
OF THE PARTIES HERETO. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES
HERETO. This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Prior Credit
Agreement. The execution of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan
Documents executed in connection herewith does not extinguish the indebtedness
outstanding in connection with the Prior Credit Agreement nor does it constitute
a novation with respect to such indebtedness. The Borrower, the Agent and the
Banks ratify and confirm each of the Loan Documents and Bond Documents entered
into prior to the Closing Date (but excluding the Prior Credit Agreement) and
agree that such Loan Documents and Bond Documents continue to be legal, valid,
binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and notwithstanding any Loan Document
or Bond Document to the contrary, the Borrower, the Agent and the Banks agree
and acknowledge that the term "Credit Agreement" as used in each Loan Document
and the term "Reimbursement Agreement" as used in any Bond Documents or other
similar term referring to the reimbursement agreement of the issuer of the
letter of credit under the applicable Bond Documents relating to the South
Carolina Bonds, means, in each case, this Agreement. However, for all matters
arising prior to the effective date of this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the accrual and payment of interest and fees, and matters relating
to indemnification and compliance with financial covenants), the terms of the
Prior Credit Agreement (as unmodified by this Agreement) shall control and are
hereby ratified and confirmed. THE BORROWER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT TO THE
BEST OF ITS KNOWLEDGE AS OF THE CLOSING DATE THERE ARE NO


                                    Page 65
<PAGE>

CLAIMS OR OFFSETS AGAINST OR RIGHTS OF RECOUPMENT WITH RESPECT TO OR DEFENSES OR
COUNTERCLAIMS TO ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND IN ACCORDANCE THEREWITH IT.

      Section 15.11. Waivers; Amendments.

            (a) No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to
any departure by the Borrower or any Obligated Party therefrom shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 15.11(b), and
then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Agent or any
Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant
to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the
Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Agent and the Borrower or
the Obligated Party that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of
the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall: (i) increase the
Commitment of any Bank without the written consent of such Bank; (ii) reduce the
principal amount of any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, reduce the
amount of any Reimbursement Obligation or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Bank affected thereby; (iii) postpone the
scheduled date of payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, the principal amount
of any Loan, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce
the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date
of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Bank
affected thereby, (iv) change Section 6.6 or Section 6.7 in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written
consent of each Bank, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section 15.11 or
the definition of "Required Lenders," "Secured Party," "Borrowing Base" or
"Obligation" (or any term defined therein) or any other provision of any Loan
Document specifying the number or percentage of Banks (or Banks of any Class)
required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
each Bank (or each Bank of such Class, as the case may be), (vi) release any
Guarantor from its Guarantee under the Master Guaranty (except as expressly
provided in the Master Guaranty), or limit its liability in respect of such
Guarantee, without the written consent of each Bank, (vii) release any of the
Collateral, without the written consent of each Bank or (viii) change any
provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms adversely affects
the rights in respect of payments due to the Banks holding Loans of any Class
differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without the written
consent of Banks holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and
unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Agent without the prior written consent of the Agent. A Secured Party who is not
a Bank or the Agent shall have no right to consent or agree to any amendment or
other modification to any of the Loan Documents and the Loan Documents may be
amended and otherwise modified without any such Secured Party's consent.

      Section 15.12. Maximum Interest Rate.

            (a) No interest rate specified in any Loan Document shall at any
time exceed the Maximum Rate. If at any time the interest rate (the "Contract
Rate") for any Obligation shall exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the
interest accruing on such Obligation to be limited to the Maximum


                                    Page 66
<PAGE>

Rate, then any subsequent reduction in the Contract Rate for such Obligation
shall not reduce the rate of interest on such Obligation below the Maximum Rate
until the aggregate amount of interest accrued on such Obligation equals the
aggregate amount of interest which would have accrued on such Obligation if the
Contract Rate for such Obligation had at all times been in effect.

            (b) No provision of any Loan Document shall require the payment or
the collection of interest in excess of the maximum amount permitted by
applicable law. If any excess of interest in such respect is hereby provided
for, or shall be adjudicated to be so provided, in any Loan Document or
otherwise in connection with this loan transaction, the provisions of this
Section shall govern and prevail and neither the Borrower nor the sureties,
guarantors, successors, or assigns of the Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
excess amount of such interest or any other excess sum paid for the use,
forbearance, or detention of sums loaned pursuant hereto. In the event any Bank
ever receives, collects, or applies as interest any such sum, such amount which
would be in excess of the maximum amount permitted by applicable law shall be
applied as a payment and reduction of the principal of the Obligations, and, if
the principal of the Obligations has been paid in full, any remaining excess
shall forthwith be paid to the Borrower. In determining whether or not the
interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate, the Borrower and each Bank
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any non -
principal payment as an expense, fee, or premium rather than as interest, (b)
exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize,
prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of
interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the Obligations so that
interest for the entire term does not exceed the Maximum Rate.

      Section 15.13. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for
in any Loan Document to which the Borrower or any Obligated Party is a party
shall be given or made in writing and telecopied, mailed by certified mail
return receipt requested, or delivered to the intended recipient at the "Address
for Notices" specified below its name on the signature pages hereof and, if to
an Obligated Party, at the address for notices for the Borrower, or, as to any
party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party in a notice to
each other party given in accordance with this Section. Except as otherwise
provided in any Loan Document, all such communications shall be deemed to have
been duly given when transmitted by telecopy, subject to telephone confirmation
of receipt, or when personally delivered or, in the case of a mailed notice,
three (3) Business Days after being duly deposited in the mails, in each case
given or addressed as aforesaid; provided, however, notices to the Agent
pursuant to Section 6.3 shall not be effective until received by the Agent.

      Section 15.14. Governing Law; Venue of Service of Process. This Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Texas and the applicable laws of the United States of America. ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING AGAINST THE BORROWER UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT
MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE COURT LOCATED IN DALLAS, TEXAS OR ANY FEDERAL COURT
IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY (a) SUBMITS
TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, AND (b) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT
MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING
BROUGHT IN SUCH COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE BORROWER
AGREES THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS UPON IT MAY BE MADE BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED
MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, AT ITS ADDRESS SPECIFIED OR DETERMINED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 15.13 OF THIS AGREEMENT. NOTHING IN
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR
ANY OTHER SECURED PARTY TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR
SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY OTHER SECURED PARTY TO BRING ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING AGAINST THE BORROWER OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF ITS PROPERTY
IN COURTS IN


                                    Page 67
<PAGE>

OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE BORROWER AGAINST THE AGENT
OR ANY OTHER SECURED PARTY SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT LOCATED IN DALLAS,
TEXAS.

      Section 15.15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts and on telecopy counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

      Section 15.16. Severability. Any provision of any Loan Document held by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable shall not impair
or invalidate the remainder of any Loan Document and the effect thereof shall be
confined to the provision held to be invalid or illegal.

      Section 15.17. Headings. The headings, captions, and arrangements used in
this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation
of this Agreement.

      Section 15.18. Non-Application of Chapter 346 of The Finance Code of
Texas. The provisions of Chapter 346 of The Finance Code of Texas are
specifically declared by the parties hereto not to be applicable to any Loan
Documents or to the transactions contemplated thereby.

      Section 15.19. Construction. The Borrower, each Obligated Party (by its
execution of the Loan Documents to which its is a party), the Agent, and each
Bank acknowledges that each of them has had the benefit of legal counsel of its
own choice and has been afforded an opportunity to review the Loan Documents
with its legal counsel and that the Loan Documents shall be construed as if
jointly drafted by the parties thereto.

      Section 15.20. Independence of Covenants. All covenants under the Loan
Documents shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or
condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be
permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another
covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default if such action is taken or
such condition exists.

      Section 15.21. Waiver of Jury Trial. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF THE AGENT OR ANY BANK IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, OR
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

                 AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER GUARANTY AGREEMENT

      THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED MASTER GUARANTY AGREEMENT (this "Guaranty
Agreement") dated as of August 15, 2002, is executed and delivered by each of
the undersigned parties (each, together with any party hereafter added as a
"Guarantor" hereto pursuant to a Joinder Agreement, individually a "Guarantor"
and collectively the "Guarantors") to JPMorgan Chase Bank, as agent for the
Secured Parties (the "Agent")

      WHEREAS, TUFCO, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Borrower"),
entered into that certain Credit Agreement dated August 28, 1998, among the
Borrower, Tufco Technologies, Inc. (the "Parent"), Chase Bank of Texas, National
Association (now JPMorgan Chase Bank) and First Union National Bank (now
Wachovia Bank National Association), as agent for the banks named therein (the
"Prior Agent") (such agreement as the same had been amended, being hereinafter
referred to as the "Prior Credit Agreement");

      WHEREAS, as a condition to the Prior Credit Agreement, the Guarantors
executed and delivered that certain Guaranty Agreement dated August 28, 1998 in
favor of the Prior Agent (the "Prior Guaranty Agreement");

      WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Assignment and Acceptance dated August
15, 2002: (i) the Prior Agent assigned to the Agent all of the Prior Agent's
rights, title and interest in, among other things, the Prior Credit Agreement
and the Prior Guaranty Agreement, (ii) the Prior Agent resigned as agent for the
banks named in the Prior Credit Agreement and (iii) JPMorgan Chase Bank was
appointed as agent for the banks named in the Prior Credit Agreement;

      WHEREAS, the Borrower is entering into that certain Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated August 15, 2002, among the Borrower, the Parent, the
Agent and the Banks which amends and restates the Prior Credit Agreement in its
entirety but does not extinguish the indebtedness outstanding thereunder (such
agreement, as it may hereafter be amended or otherwise modified from time to
time, being hereafter referred to as the "Credit Agreement", and capitalized
terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the same meaning as set forth in
the Credit Agreement);

      WHEREAS, the execution of this Guaranty Agreement is a condition to the
effectiveness of, and to the Agent's and each Bank's obligations under, the
Credit Agreement;

      NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of
which are hereby acknowledged, each of the undersigned parties and any party
hereafter added as a "Guarantor" hereto pursuant to a Joinder Agreement, hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to the Agent and the Banks the full
and prompt payment and performance of the Guaranteed Indebtedness (hereinafter
defined), this Guaranty Agreement being upon the following terms:

      1. The term "Guaranteed Indebtedness", as used herein means all of the
"Obligations", as defined in the Credit Agreement, of the Borrower and shall
include any and all post-petition interest and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) whether or not allowed under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar
law; provided that, the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall be limited, with respect
to each Guarantor, to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would
not render such Guarantor's obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under
Section 544 or 548 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or under any applicable
state law relating to fraudulent transfers or conveyances.

      2. Each Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement, and each guarantor under
other guaranties, if any, relating to the Credit Agreement (the "Related
Guaranties") which contain a


                                     Page 1
<PAGE>

contribution provision similar to that set forth in this paragraph 2, together
desire to allocate among themselves (collectively, the "Contributing
Guarantors"), in a fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under
this Guaranty Agreement and the Related Guaranties. Accordingly, in the event
any payment or distribution is made by a Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement
or a guarantor under a Related Guaranty (a "Funding Guarantor") that exceeds its
Fair Share (as defined below), that Funding Guarantor shall be entitled to a
contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors in the amount of
such other Contributing Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall (as defined below),
with the result that all such contributions will cause each Contributing
Guarantor's Aggregate Payments (as defined below) to equal its Fair Share. "Fair
Share" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of
determination, an amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the Adjusted Maximum
Amount (as defined below) with respect to such Contributing Guarantor to (y) the
aggregate of the Adjusted Maximum Amounts with respect to all Contributing
Guarantors, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or
before such date by all Funding Guarantors under this Guaranty Agreement and the
Related Guaranties in respect of the obligations guarantied. "Fair Share
Shortfall" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of
determination, the excess, if any, of the Fair Share of such Contributing
Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of such Contributing Guarantor. "Adjusted
Maximum Amount" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date
of determination, the maximum aggregate amount of the obligations of such
Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty Agreement and the Related Guaranties,
in each case determined in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof;
provided that, solely for purposes of calculating the "Adjusted Maximum Amount"
with respect to any Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this paragraph 2, the
assets or liabilities arising by virtue of any rights to or obligations of
contribution hereunder or under any similar provision contained in a Related
Guaranty shall not be considered as assets or liabilities of such Contributing
Guarantor. "Aggregate Payments" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor
as of any date of determination, the aggregate amount of all payments and
distributions made on or before such date by such Contributing Guarantor in
respect of this Guaranty Agreement and the Related Guaranties (including,
without limitation, in respect of this paragraph 2 or any similar provision
contained in a Related Guaranty). The amounts payable as contributions hereunder
and under similar provisions in the Related Guaranties shall be determined as of
the date on which the related payment or distribution is made by the applicable
Funding Guarantor. The allocation among Contributing Guarantors of their
obligations as set forth in this paragraph 2 or any similar provision contained
in a Related Guaranty shall not be construed in any way to limit the liability
of any Contributing Guarantor hereunder or under a Related Guaranty. Each
Contributing Guarantor under a Related Guaranty is a third party beneficiary to
the contribution agreement set forth in this paragraph 2.

      3. This instrument shall be an absolute, continuing, irrevocable and
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance, and not a guaranty of
collection, and each Guarantor shall remain liable on its obligations hereunder
until the payment and performance in full of the Guaranteed Indebtedness. No set
- off, counterclaim, recoupment, reduction, or diminution of any obligation, or
any defense of any kind or nature which the Borrower may have against the Agent,
any Secured Party or any other party, or which any Guarantor may have against
the Borrower, the Agent, any Secured Party or any other party, shall be
available to, or shall be asserted by, any Guarantor against the Agent, any
Secured Party or any subsequent holder of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any
part thereof or against payment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any part
thereof.

      4. If a Guarantor becomes liable for any indebtedness owing by the
Borrower to the Agent or any Secured Party by endorsement or otherwise, other
than under this Guaranty Agreement, such liability shall not be in any manner
impaired or affected hereby, and the rights of the Agent and the Secured Parties
hereunder shall be cumulative of any and all other rights that the Agent and the
Secured Parties may ever have against such Guarantor. The exercise by the Agent
and the Secured Parties of any


                                     Page 2
<PAGE>

right or remedy hereunder or under any other instrument, or at law or in equity,
shall not preclude the concurrent or subsequent exercise of any other right or
remedy.

      5. In the event of default by the Borrower in payment or performance of
the Guaranteed Indebtedness, or any part thereof, when such Guaranteed
Indebtedness becomes due, whether by its terms, by acceleration, or otherwise
(after expiration of any applicable grace or cure period afforded to the
Borrower in writing, if any), the Guarantors shall, jointly and severally,
promptly pay the amount due thereon to the Agent, without notice or demand, in
lawful currency of the United States of America, and it shall not be necessary
for the Agent or any Secured Party, in order to enforce such payment by any
Guarantor, first to institute suit or exhaust its remedies against the Borrower
or others liable on such Guaranteed Indebtedness, or to enforce any rights
against any collateral which shall ever have been given to secure such
Guaranteed Indebtedness. In the event such payment is made by a Guarantor, then
such Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights then held by the Agent and any
Secured Party with respect to the Guaranteed Indebtedness to the extent to which
the Guaranteed Indebtedness was discharged by such Guarantor and, in addition,
upon payment by such Guarantor of any sums to the Agent and any Secured Party
hereunder, all rights of such Guarantor against the Borrower, any other
guarantor or any Collateral arising as a result therefrom by way of right of
subrogation, reimbursement, or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinate
and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of the
Guaranteed Indebtedness.

      6. If acceleration of the time for payment of any amount payable by the
Borrower under the Guaranteed Indebtedness is stayed upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, or reorganization of the Borrower, all such amounts otherwise
subject to acceleration under the terms of the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall
nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors hereunder forthwith on demand by the
Agent or any Secured Party to the extent permitted by applicable law.

      7. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations under this Guaranty
Agreement shall not be released, discharged, diminished, impaired, reduced, or
affected for any reason or by the occurrence of any event, including, without
limitation, one or more of the following events, whether or not with notice to
or the consent of any Guarantor: (a) the taking or accepting of collateral as
security for any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or the release,
surrender, exchange, or subordination of any collateral now or hereafter
securing any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (b) any partial release of
the liability of any Guarantor hereunder, or the full or partial release of any
other guarantor from liability for any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness;
(c) any disability of the Borrower, or the dissolution, insolvency, or
bankruptcy of the Borrower, any Guarantor, or any other party at any time liable
for the payment of any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (d) any renewal,
extension, modification, waiver, amendment, or rearrangement of any or all of
the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any instrument, document, or agreement
evidencing, securing, or otherwise relating to any or all of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness; (e) any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance, waiver, or compromise
that may be granted or given by the Agent or any Secured Party to the Borrower,
any Guarantor, or any other party ever liable for any or all of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness; (f) any neglect, delay, omission, failure, or refusal of the Agent
or any Secured Party to take or prosecute any action for the collection of any
of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or to foreclose or take or prosecute any action
in connection with any instrument, document, or agreement evidencing, securing,
or otherwise relating to any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (g) the
unenforceability or invalidity of any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or
of any instrument, document, or agreement evidencing, securing, or otherwise
relating to any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (h) any payment by the
Borrower or any other party to the Agent or any Secured Party is held to
constitute a preference under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law or if for
any other reason the Agent or any Secured Party is required to refund any
payment or pay the amount thereof to someone else; (i) the settlement or
compromise of any of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (j) the non - perfection of
any security interest or lien securing any or all of the Guaranteed
Indebtedness; (k) any impairment of any


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>

collateral securing any or all of the Guaranteed Indebtedness; (l) the failure
of the Agent or any Secured Party to sell any collateral securing any or all of
the Guaranteed Indebtedness in a commercially reasonable manner or as otherwise
required by law; (m) any change in the corporate existence, structure, or
ownership of the Borrower; or (n) any other circumstance which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, the Borrower or any
Guarantor (other than payment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness).

      8. Each Guarantor represents and warrants to the Agent and the Banks as
follows:

            (a) All representations and warranties in the Credit Agreement
relating to it are true and correct as of the date hereof and on each date the
representations and warranties hereunder are restated pursuant to any of the
Loan Documents with the same force and effect as if such representations and
warranties had been made on and as of such date except to the extent that such
representations and warranties relate specifically to another date or to the
extent that a fact, event or circumstance has occurred that makes such
representation or warranty untrue but which is not prohibited to occur or exist
(or which does not cause an Event of Default) under the Loan Documents.

            (b) It has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any
Secured Party and based upon such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own analysis and decision to enter into the Loan Documents
to which it is a party.

            (c) It has adequate means to obtain from the Borrower on a
continuing basis information concerning the financial condition and assets of
the Borrower and it is not relying upon the Agent or any Secured Party to
provide (and neither the Agent nor any Secured Party shall have any duty to
provide) any such information to it either now or in the future.

            (d) The value of the consideration received and to be received by
each Guarantor as a result of the Borrower's and the Banks' entering into the
Credit Agreement and each Guarantor's executing and delivering this Guaranty
Agreement is reasonably worth at least as much as the liability and obligation
of each Guarantor hereunder, and such liability and obligation and the Credit
Agreement have benefited and may reasonably be expected to benefit each
Guarantor directly or indirectly.

      9. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees that, as long as the Guaranteed
Indebtedness or any part thereof is outstanding or any Bank has any commitment
under the Credit Agreement, it will comply with all covenants set forth in the
Credit Agreement specifically applicable to it.

      10. When an Event of Default exists, the Agent and each Secured Party
shall have the right to set - off and apply against this Guaranty Agreement or
the Guaranteed Indebtedness or both, at any time and without notice to any
Guarantor, any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final, but excluding any account established by a Guarantor as a fiduciary
for another party) or other sums at any time credited by or owing from the Agent
and the Secured Parties to any Guarantor whether or not the Guaranteed
Indebtedness is then due and irrespective of whether or not the Agent or any
Secured Party shall have made any demand under this Guaranty Agreement. Each
Secured Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent)
after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The rights
and remedies of the Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set -
off) which the Agent or any Secured Party may have.

      11. (a) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that the Subordinated Indebtedness
(as defined below) shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Guaranteed Indebtedness as herein provided. The
Subordinated Indebtedness shall not be payable, and no payment of


                                     Page 4
<PAGE>

principal, interest or other amounts on account thereof, and no property or
guarantee of any nature to secure or pay the Subordinated Indebtedness shall be
made or given, directly or indirectly by or on behalf of any Debtor (hereafter
defined) or received, accepted, retained or applied by any Guarantor unless and
until the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash; except
that prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, a Guarantor
shall have the right to receive payments on the Subordinated Indebtedness made
in the ordinary course of business. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, no payments may be made or given, directly
or indirectly, by or on behalf of any Debtor or received, accepted, retained or
applied by any Guarantor unless and until the Guaranteed Indebtedness shall have
been paid in full in cash. If any sums shall be paid to a Guarantor by any
Debtor or any other Person on account of the Subordinated Indebtedness when such
payment is not permitted hereunder, such sums shall be held in trust by such
Guarantor for the benefit of the Agent and the Secured Parties and shall
forthwith be paid to the Agent without affecting the liability of any Guarantor
under this Guaranty Agreement and may be applied by the Agent against the
Guaranteed Indebtedness in accordance with the Credit Agreement. Upon the
request of the Agent, a Guarantor shall execute, deliver, and endorse to the
Agent such documentation as the Agent may request to perfect, preserve, and
enforce its rights hereunder. For purposes of this Guaranty Agreement and with
respect to a Guarantor, the term "Subordinated Indebtedness" means all
indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of the Borrower or any Obligated
Party other than such Guarantor (the Borrower and such Obligated Parties herein
the "Debtors") to such Guarantor, whether such indebtedness, liabilities, and
obligations now exist or are hereafter incurred or arise, or are direct,
indirect, contingent, primary, secondary, several, joint and several, or
otherwise, and irrespective of whether such indebtedness, liabilities, or
obligations are evidenced by a note, contract, open account, or otherwise, and
irrespective of the Person or Persons in whose favor such indebtedness,
obligations, or liabilities may, at their inception, have been, or may hereafter
be created, or the manner in which they have been or may hereafter be acquired
by such Guarantor.

            (b) Each Guarantor agrees that any and all Liens (including any
judgment liens), upon any Debtor's assets securing payment of any Subordinated
Indebtedness shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to any and all Liens
upon any Debtor's assets securing payment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness or any
part thereof, regardless of whether such Liens in favor of a Guarantor, the
Agent or any Secured Party presently exist or are hereafter created or attached.
Without the prior written consent of the Agent, no Guarantor shall (i) file suit
against any Debtor or exercise or enforce any other creditor's right it may have
against any Debtor, or (ii) foreclose, repossess, sequester, or otherwise take
steps or institute any action or proceedings (judicial or otherwise, including
without limitation the commencement of, or joinder in, any liquidation,
bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtor's relief or insolvency proceeding) to enforce
any obligations of any Debtor to such Guarantor or any Liens held by such
Guarantor on assets of any Debtor.

            (c) In the event of any receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization,
rearrangement, debtor's relief, or other insolvency proceeding involving any
Debtor as debtor, the Agent shall have the right to prove and vote any claim
under the Subordinated Indebtedness and to receive directly from the receiver,
trustee or other court custodian all dividends, distributions, and payments made
in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness until the Guaranteed Indebtedness
has been paid in full in cash. The Agent may apply any such dividends,
distributions, and payments against the Guaranteed Indebtedness in accordance
with the Credit Agreement.

            (d) Each Guarantor agrees that all promissory notes, accounts
receivable, ledgers, records, or any other evidence of Subordinated Indebtedness
shall contain a specific written notice thereon that the indebtedness evidenced
thereby is subordinated under the terms of this Guaranty Agreement.


                                     Page 5

      12. Except for modifications made pursuant to the execution and delivery
of a Joinder Agreement (which needs to be signed only by the party thereto), no
amendment or waiver of any provision of this Guaranty Agreement or consent to
any departure by any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be in writing and signed by the Agent and the Required Banks
except as otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement. No failure on the part of
the Agent or any Secured Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any
right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power, or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power, or privilege. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

      13. To the extent permitted by law, any acknowledgment or new promise,
whether by payment of principal or interest or otherwise and whether by the
Borrower or others (including any Guarantor), with respect to any of the
Guaranteed Indebtedness shall, if the statute of limitations in favor of a
Guarantor against the Agent or any Secured Party shall have commenced to run,
toll the running of such statute of limitations and, if the period of such
statute of limitations shall have expired, prevent the operation of such statute
of limitations.

      14. This Guaranty Agreement is for the benefit of the Agent and the
Secured Parties and their successors and assigns, and in the event of an
assignment of the Guaranteed Indebtedness, or any part thereof, the rights and
benefits hereunder, to the extent applicable to the indebtedness so assigned,
may be transferred with such indebtedness. This Guaranty Agreement is binding
not only on each Guarantor, but on each Guarantor's successors and assigns.

      15. Each Guarantor recognizes that the Agent and the Banks are relying
upon this Guaranty Agreement and the undertakings of each Guarantor hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents to which each is a party in making extensions
of credit to the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and further recognizes that
the execution and delivery of this Guaranty Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to which each Guarantor is a party is a material inducement to the
Agent and the Banks in entering into the Credit Agreement and continuing to
extend credit thereunder. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges that there are no
conditions to the full effectiveness of this Guaranty Agreement or any other
Loan Document to which it is a party.

      16. Any notice or demand to any Guarantor under or in connection with this
Guaranty Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it is a party shall be
deemed effective if given to the Guarantor, care of the Borrower in accordance
with the notice provisions in the Credit Agreement.

      17. The Guarantors shall, jointly and severally, pay on demand all
reasonable attorneys' fees and all other reasonable costs and expenses incurred
by the Agent and the Secured Party in connection with the administration,
enforcement, or collection of this Guaranty Agreement.

      18. Each Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of any
default under the Guaranteed Indebtedness, demand of payment, notice of
acceptance of this Guaranty Agreement, presentment, notice of protest, notice of
dishonor, notice of the incurring by the Borrower of additional indebtedness,
and all other notices and demands with respect to the Guaranteed Indebtedness
and this Guaranty Agreement.

      19. The Credit Agreement, and all of the terms thereof, are incorporated
herein by reference, the same as if stated verbatim herein, and each Guarantor
agrees that the Agent and the Banks may exercise any and all rights granted to
any of them under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents without
affecting the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty Agreement.


                                     Page 6

      20. THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT EMBODIES THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT OF EACH
GUARANTOR, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS WITH RESPECT TO EACH GUARANTOR'S GUARANTY OF
THE GUARANTEED INDEBTEDNESS AND SUPERSEDES ANY AND ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS,
AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRIOR GUARANTY AGREEMENT),
REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERSTANDINGS, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, RELATING TO THE
SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF. THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT IS INTENDED BY EACH GUARANTOR,
THE AGENT AND THE SECURED PARTIES AS A FINAL AND COMPLETE EXPRESSION OF THE
TERMS OF THE GUARANTY AGREEMENT, AND NO COURSE OF DEALING AMONG ANY GUARANTOR,
THE AGENT AND THE SECURED PARTIES, NO COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, NO TRADE PRACTICES,
AND NO EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR
DISCUSSIONS OR OTHER EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE OF ANY NATURE SHALL BE USED TO
CONTRADICT, VARY, SUPPLEMENT OR MODIFY ANY TERM OF THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT.
THERE ARE NO ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG ANY GUARANTOR, THE AGENT AND THE SECURED
PARTIES. THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT AMENDS AND RESTATES IN ITS ENTIRETY THE PRIOR
GUARANTY AGREEMENT. THE EXECUTION OF THIS GUARANTY AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH DO NOT EXTINGUISH, DISCHARGE OR
SATISFY THE INDEBTEDNESS GUARANTEED BY THE PRIOR GUARANTY AGREEMENT, WHICH
INDEBTEDNESS GUARANTEED IS CONTINUED HEREBY.

      21. This Guaranty Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas (without regard to the conflicts
of law provisions thereof) and applicable laws of the United States of America.

course of business; or (e) release any Lien, guaranty or other supporting
obligation securing any of its accounts or payment intangibles unless the
amounts secured thereby have been paid.

      Section 4.2. Further Assurances; Exceptions to Perfection. At any time and
from time to time, upon the request of the Agent, and at its sole expense, it
shall, subject to Section 10.10 of the Credit Agreement, promptly execute and

may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to preserve, perfect and protect
its security interest in the Collateral and carry out the provisions and

amendment to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent; and

                  (v) execute and deliver to the Agent such other documentation
as the Agent may reasonably require to perfect, protect and maintain the
validity, effectiveness and priority of the Liens intended to be created by this
Agreement.

            (b) Exceptions to Perfection. Notwithstanding the foregoing however,

received and further negotiated in the ordinary course of business; and

                  (v) a Debtor shall not be required to take the actions to

jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any jurisdiction located
therein to create, perfect or protect the security interest of the Agent in the
equity interest of the Foreign Subsidiaries pledged pursuant hereto or in any
Intellectual Property registered outside the Untied States of America.

If a Default occurs and the Agent requests, then the Debtors shall take such
action as the Agent may reasonably request to perfect and protect the security
interests of the Agent in all of the Collateral including any of the
requirements described in clause (v) or Section 10.10 of the Credit Agreement
and including the following actions: (i) the delivery to the Agent of all
Collateral the possession of which is necessary to perfect the security interest
of the Agent therein; (ii) instructing all account debtors to make payment on
accounts any other Collateral to a post office box or boxes or to a deposit

accounts or payment intangibles) shall be received by it while a Default exists,
it shall promptly deliver such proceeds to the Agent with any necessary
endorsements, and until such proceeds are delivered to the Agent, such proceeds
shall be held in trust by it for the benefit of the Agent and shall not be

processor or other third Person is located (including the filing of a financing
statement in the proper jurisdiction naming the applicable third Person as
debtor and it as secured party and notifying the third Person's secured lenders
of its interest in such Collateral before the third Person receives possession
of the Collateral in question).

      Section 4.4. Corporate Changes. It shall not change its name, jurisdiction
of organization, or corporate structure in any manner that might make any
financing statement filed in connection with this Agreement seriously misleading
or its United States Federal Tax identification number or organizational

Default exists it shall be entitled to exercise any and all voting and other

Agent which would be inconsistent with or violate any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

      Section 4.8. Additional Investment Property and Instruments. It agrees
that it will: (a) not permit any issuer of any of the Pledged Shares to issue
any shares of stock, or any other equity, partnership, membership or other

or in substitution for any of the Collateral unless permitted by the Credit

ownership interests, notes or other securities or instruments (including any of
the same received from a Subsidiary created or acquired after the date hereof;

jurisdiction outside the United States of America), and (c) promptly (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days) deliver to the Agent an amendment hereto,
duly executed by it, in substantially the form of Exhibit A (an "Amendment"), in
respect of such shares of stock, other ownership interests, notes or other

Agent to attach each Amendment to this Agreement, and (b) agrees that all such
shares of stock and other ownership interests, notes or other securities or
instruments listed on any Amendment delivered to the Agent shall for all
purposes hereunder constitute Collateral.

      Section 4.9. Intellectual Property Covenants. If it obtains any new
Intellectual Property or rights thereto or becomes entitled to the benefit of
any Intellectual Property, it shall give to the Agent prompt written notice

with respect to the Intellectual Property. It shall not abandon any pending
copyright, patent or trademark application, or Copyright, Patent, Trademark or
any other Intellectual Property which is necessary for the conduct of its
business without the prior written consent of the Agent. It shall not amend or
otherwise modify any Trademark License, Copyright License or Patent License
except to the extent that such amendment or modification would not have a
material adverse effect on the value of the Collateral or the ability of the
Agent to exercise any of its remedies.

      Section 4.10. Deposit, Commodity and Security Accounts. It shall not open
any new deposit, commodity or security account or otherwise utilize any such
account other than the accounts identified on

                                     Page 9
<PAGE>
Schedule 3.2 unless it shall have given the Agent thirty (30) days prior written
notice thereof and shall have taken all action deemed necessary or desirable by
the Agent to cause its security interest therein to be perfected with priority
required by the Credit Agreement. When no Default exists, it may make purchases
and sales of investment property in accordance with the restrictions on
investment set out in the Credit Agreement and may make withdrawals from its
deposit accounts. When a Default exists, it shall not be authorized to make
purchases and sales of the investment property, shall not be authorized to make
any withdrawals from any deposit account and it shall take such steps as Agent
may reasonably request to give Agent control over all investment property and
deposit accounts. It will not give any party except the Agent control over any
investment property or deposit account.

      Section 4.11. Chattel Paper and Letters of Credit. It will not give any
party except the Agent control over any letter of credit right or electronic
chattel paper. It will not create any chattel paper without placing a legend on
the chattel paper acceptable to the Agent indicating that the Agent has a
security interest in the chattel paper.

      Section 4.12. Commercial Tort Claims. It will amend Schedule 2.1(a) hereto

claim that arises after the date hereof that relates to or arises out of the
Collateral or the conduct of its business in relation thereto.

      Section 4.13. Transfers; Liens. It shall not sell, lease, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of its Collateral or any right, title or interest

                               Rights of the Agent

      Section 5.1. POWER OF ATTORNEY. EACH DEBTOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSTITUTES
AND APPOINTS THE AGENT AND ANY OFFICER OR AGENT THEREOF, WITH FULL POWER OF
SUBSTITUTION, AS ITS TRUE AND LAWFUL ATTORNEY-IN-FACT WITH FULL IRREVOCABLE
POWER AND AUTHORITY IN THE NAME OF SUCH DEBTOR OR IN ITS OWN NAME, TO TAKE, ANY
AND ALL ACTIONS AND TO EXECUTE ANY AND ALL DOCUMENTATION WHICH THE AGENT AT ANY
TIME WHEN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS AND FROM TIME TO TIME DURING the EXISTENCE
of AN EVENT OF DEFAULT DEEMS NECESSARY OR DESIRABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSES
OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE PRIOR SECURITY AGREEMENTS AND, WITHOUT LIMITING THE
GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, IT HEREBY GIVES THE AGENT THE POWER AND RIGHT ON
ITS BEHALF AND IN AGENT'S OWN NAME TO DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING WHEN AN EVENT OF
DEFAULT EXISTS, WITH NOTICE TO BORROWER BUT WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ANY DEBTOR:

Collateral or any policy of insurance;

            (d) (i) to direct account debtors and any other parties obligated on

and prosecute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity in any court of
competent jurisdiction to collect the Collateral or any part thereof and to
enforce any other right in respect of any Collateral (including any Liens or any
supporting obligation securing or supporting the payment thereof); (v) to defend
any suit, action or proceeding brought against it with respect to any
Collateral; (vi) to settle, compromise or adjust any suit, action or proceeding
described above and, in connection therewith, to give such discharges or
releases as the Agent may deem appropriate; (vii) to exchange any of the
Collateral for other property upon any merger, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or other readjustment of the issuer thereof and, in connection
therewith, deposit any of the Collateral with any committee, depositary,
transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms as the
Agent may determine; (viii) to add or release any guarantor, endorser, surety or
other party to any of the Collateral; (ix) to renew, extend or otherwise change

completely as though the Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all purposes,
and to do, at the Agent's option and the Debtors' expense, at any time, or from
time to time, all acts and things which the Agent deems necessary to protect,
preserve, maintain, or realize upon the Collateral and the Agent's security
interest therein.

      THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY IS A POWER COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND SHALL BE
IRREVOCABLE UNTIL TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 7.10.
The Agent shall be under no duty to exercise or withhold the exercise of any of
the rights, powers, privileges and options expressly or implicitly granted to
the Agent in this Agreement, and shall not be liable for any failure to do so or
any delay in doing so. Neither the Agent nor any Person designated by the Agent
shall be liable for any act or omission or for any error of judgment or any
mistake of fact or law, except any of the same resulting from its or their gross
negligence or willful misconduct. This power of attorney is conferred on the
Agent solely to protect, preserve, maintain and realize upon its security
interest in the Collateral. The Agent shall not be responsible for any decline
in the value of the Collateral and shall not be required to take any steps to
preserve rights against prior parties or to protect, preserve or maintain any
Lien or supporting obligation given to secure the Collateral.

      Section 5.2. Possession; Reasonable Care. The Agent may, from time to
time, in its sole discretion, appoint one or more agents to hold physical
custody, for the account of the Agent, of any or all of the Collateral that the
Agent has a right to possess. The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised
reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its
possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to that
which the Agent accords its own property, it being understood that the Agent
shall not have any responsibility for: (a) ascertaining or taking action with
respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters
relative to any Collateral,

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>
whether or not the Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters, or
(b) taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with
respect to any Collateral.

                                   ARTICLE 6.

                                     Default

      Section 6.1. Rights and Remedies. If an Event of Default exists, the Agent
shall have the following rights and remedies:

            (a) In addition to all other rights and remedies granted to the
Agent in this Agreement (including those set forth in Article 5 hereof) or in
any other Loan Document or by applicable law, the Agent shall have all of the
rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (whether or not the UCC
applies to the affected Collateral). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Agent may: (i) without demand or notice to any Debtor, collect,
receive or take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof and for that
purpose the Agent may enter upon any premises on which the Collateral is located
and remove the Collateral therefrom or render it inoperable and in the event the
Agent seeks to take possession of any or all of the Collateral by judicial
process, each Debtor hereby irrevocably waives any bonds and any surety or
security relating thereto that may be required by applicable law as an incident
to such possession, and waives any demand for possession prior to the
commencement of any such suit or action; (ii) apply the balance of Debtor's
deposit account held at the Agent to Debtor's Obligation; (iii) instruct any
bank holding any Debtor's deposit accounts to pay the balance of such deposit
account to or for the benefit of the Agent; and/or (iv) sell, lease or otherwise
dispose of the Collateral, or any part thereof, in one or more parcels at public
or private sale or sales, at the Agent's offices or elsewhere, for cash, on
credit or for future delivery, on an "as is" and "with all faults" basis, with a
disclaimer of all warranties (including warranties of title, possession, quiet
enjoyment and the like and all warranties of merchantability and fitness) and
upon such other terms as the Agent may deem commercially reasonable or otherwise
as may be permitted by law. Neither the Agent nor any Secured Party shall have
any obligation to clean - up or otherwise prepare the Collateral for sale if the
Agent determines that it is not beneficial to do so or if its costs to do so
outweigh the benefits expected to be received thereby. The Agent shall have the
right at any public sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, at any private sale or sales, to bid (which bid may be, in whole or in
part, in the form of cancellation of indebtedness) and become a purchaser of the
Collateral or any part thereof. Upon the request of the Agent, each Debtor shall
within ten (10) days (or within such longer number of days as the Agent may
approve): (i) assemble its Collateral and (ii) make it available to the Agent at
any place or places designated by the Agent that are reasonably convenient to it
and the Agent. Each Debtor agrees that the Agent shall not be obligated to give
more than ten (10) days prior written notice of the time and place of any public
sale or of the time after which any private sale may take place and that such
notice shall constitute reasonable notice of such matters; provided that no such
notice shall be required with respect to any Collateral that is perishable, that
threatens to decline speedily in value or is a type customarily sold on the
recognized market. The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral if it shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that
notice of sale of Collateral may have been given. The Agent may, without notice
or publication, adjourn any public or private sale or cause the same to be
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for
sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place
to which the same was so adjourned. Each Debtor shall be liable for all
reasonable expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or the like, and
all reasonable attorneys' fees, legal expenses and other costs and expenses
incurred by the Agent in connection with the collection of its Obligations and
the enforcement of the Agent's rights under this Agreement and arising as a
result hereof. Each Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral applied to its
Obligations are insufficient to pay

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>
its Obligations in full. The Agent may apply the Collateral against the
Obligations as provided in the Credit Agreement and when applying the Collateral
against the Obligations, unless otherwise provided in the Credit Agreement, any
Obligations which are purchase money obligations or represent proceeds of loans
utilized to acquire the Collateral shall be deemed to be paid last. Each Debtor
waives all rights of marshalling, valuation and appraisal in respect of the
Collateral. Any proceeds received or held by the Agent in respect of any sale
of, collection from or other realization upon all or any part of the Collateral
may, in the discretion of the Agent, be held by the Agent as collateral for, and
then or at any time thereafter applied in whole or in part by the Agent against,
the Obligations in the order permitted by the Credit Agreement. Any surplus of
such proceeds and interest accrued thereon, if any, held by the Agent and
remaining after payment in full of all the Obligations and the termination of
all commitments and letters of credit under the Credit Agreement shall be
promptly paid over to the Debtor entitled thereto or to whomsoever may be
lawfully entitled to receive such surplus. The Agent shall have no obligation to
invest or otherwise pay interest on any amounts held by it in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement, unless it has otherwise agreed to do so.

            (b) The Agent may cause any or all of the Collateral held by it to
be transferred into the name of the Agent or the name or names of the Agent's
nominee or nominees.

            (c) The Agent may exercise any and all of the rights and remedies of
any Debtor under or in respect of the Collateral, including any and all rights
to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount under, or performance of
any provision of, any of the Collateral and any and all voting rights and
corporate powers in respect of the Collateral. Each Debtor shall execute and
deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the Agent all such proxies
and other documentation as the Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of
enabling the Agent to exercise the voting and other rights which it is entitled
to exercise pursuant to this clause (c) and to receive the dividends, interest
and other amounts which it is entitled to receive hereunder.

            (d) The Agent may collect or receive all money or property at any
time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the
Collateral, but shall be under no obligation to do so.

            (e) On any sale of the Collateral, the Agent is hereby authorized to
comply with any limitation or restriction with which compliance is necessary, in
the view of the Agent's counsel, in order to avoid any violation of applicable
law or in order to obtain any required approval of the purchaser or purchasers
by any applicable governmental unit. Such compliance will not be considered to
adversely affect the commercial reasonableness of any sale of any Collateral.

            (f) For purposes of enabling the Agent to exercise its rights and
remedies under this Section 6.1 and enabling the Agent and its successors and
assigns to enjoy the full benefits of the Collateral in each case as the Agent
shall be entitled to exercise its rights and remedies under this Section 6.1,
each Debtor hereby grants to the Agent an irrevocable, nonexclusive license
(exercisable without payment of royalty or other compensation to it) to use,
assign, license or sublicense any of its Intellectual Property, including in
such license reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items
may be recorded or stored and all computer programs used for the completion or
printout thereof and further including in such license such rights of quality
control and inspection as are reasonably necessary to prevent the Trademarks
included in such license from claims of invalidation. This license shall also
inure to the benefit of all successors, assigns and transferees of the Agent.

            (g) If the Agent sells any of the Collateral of a Debtor on credit,
such Debtor will be credited only with payments actually made by the purchaser,
received by the Agent and applied to the

                                    Page 13
<PAGE>
indebtedness of the purchaser. In the event the purchaser fails to pay for the
Collateral, the Agent may resell the Collateral and the applicable Debtor shall
be credited with the proceeds of the sale.

      Section 6.2. Private Sales. Each Debtor recognizes that the Agent may be
unable to effect a public sale of any or all of the Collateral by reason of
certain prohibitions contained in the laws of any jurisdiction outside the
United States or in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended from time to time
(the "Securities Act") and applicable state securities laws, but may be
compelled to resort to one or more private sales thereof to a restricted group
of purchasers who will be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such
Collateral for their own account for investment and not with a view to the
distribution or resale thereof. Each Debtor acknowledges and agrees that any
such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable to the
seller than if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such
circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall, to the extent permitted
by law, be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. Neither
the Agent nor any Secured Party shall be under any obligation to delay a sale of
any of the Collateral for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer of
such securities to register such securities under the laws of any jurisdiction
outside the United States, under the Securities Act or under any applicable
state securities laws, even if such issuer would agree to do so. Each Debtor
further agrees to do or cause to be done, to the extent that it may do so under
applicable law, all such other reasonable acts and things as may be necessary to
make such sales or resales of any portion or all of the Collateral valid and
binding and in compliance with any and all applicable laws, regulations, orders,
writs, injunctions, decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators or
governmental units, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over any such sale
or sales, all at the Debtors' expense.

                                   ARTICLE 7.

                                  Miscellaneous

      Section 7.1. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure on the part of the
Agent to exercise and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with
respect to, any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as
a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof
or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies
provided for in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
and remedies provided by law.

      Section 7.2. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of each Debtor, the Agent, the Secured Parties and
respective successors and assigns, except that no Debtor may assign any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the Banks and the Agent may not appoint a successor Agent except in accordance
with the Credit Agreement.

      Section 7.3. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT; AMENDMENTS. THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS EMBODY THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG
THE PARTIES HERETO AND SUPERSEDE ANY AND ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRIOR SECURITY AGREEMENTS), REPRESENTATIONS
AND UNDERSTANDINGS, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER
HEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO. This
Agreement consolidates, amends and restates in their entireties the Prior
Security Agreements. The execution of this

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>
Agreement and the other Loan Documents executed in connection herewith do not
extinguish the liens and security interests created by the Prior Security
Agreements, which liens and security interests are continued hereby
uninterrupted, without change to the priority thereof. Except as contemplated by
the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement or an Amendment (which only
needs to be signed by the party thereto), the provisions of this Agreement may
be amended or waived only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties
hereto and the Required Banks.

      Section 7.4. Notices. All notices and other communications provided for in
this Agreement shall be given or made in accordance with the Credit Agreement
and if to any Debtor, at the address for notices of the Borrower set forth
therein.

      Section 7.5. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Texas (without regard to
the conflicts of law provisions thereof) and the applicable laws of the United
States of America.

      Section 7.6. Headings. The headings, captions, and arrangements used in
this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation
of this Agreement.

      Section 7.7. Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations, warranties and certifications made in this Agreement or in any
documentation delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, and no investigation by the Agent shall affect the
representations, warranties and certifications or the right of the Agent or any
Secured Party to rely upon them.

      Section 7.8. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

      Section 7.9. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions of this Agreement, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

      Section 7.10. Termination; Release of Pledged Bonds. If all of the
Obligations shall have been paid and performed in full, all commitments of the
Agent and the Banks shall have expired or terminated and no letters of credit
under the Credit Agreement shall remain outstanding, the Agent shall, upon the
written request, execute and deliver to Debtors proper documentation
acknowledging the release and termination of the security interests created by
this Agreement, and shall duly assign and deliver to each Debtor (without
recourse and without any representation or warranty) such of the Collateral as
may be in the possession of the Agent and has not previously been sold or
otherwise applied pursuant to this Agreement. The Agent also agrees to release
the security interest created herein in any Pledged Bonds that are successfully
remarketed under the terms of the applicable Bond Documents.

      Section 7.11. Obligations Absolute. All rights and remedies of the Agent
hereunder, and all obligations of each Debtor hereunder, shall be absolute and
unconditional irrespective of: (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any

of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from any of the Loan
Documents; (c) any exchange, release, or nonperfection of any Collateral, or any
release or amendment or waiver of or consent to any departure from any guarantee
or other supporting obligation, for all or any of the Obligations; or (d) any
other

circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, a third party pledgor or surety.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement
as of the day and year first written above.
