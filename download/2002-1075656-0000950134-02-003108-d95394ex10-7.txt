Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in the aggregate the following
consideration (the "Merger Consideration"):

                           (i)      3,100,000 shares (the "Parent Shares") of
                                    common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
                                    Parent (the "Parent Common Stock"), subject

                                    below;

                                    subsection (ii) are sometimes collectively

                                    below.

The Merger Consideration shall be allocated among the holders of Company Common
Stock pro rata based on the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by a
holder as of the Effective Time as compared to the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

                  (b) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued as Merger
Consideration shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall take such action as
shall be necessary to issue the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received as
Merger Consideration and cause them to be registered on its share register in
the names of the holders of Company Common Stock submitting Certificates (as
defined in Section 1.6(c)) in exchange therefore in accordance with the terms
hereof.

                  (c) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder (other than Parent, Sub and the Company ) of a
certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such
shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right
to receive the applicable Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II
upon the surrender of such Certificate.

                  (d) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and owned or
held by Parent, Sub or the Company at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and no shares
of Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefore.

                  (e) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Sub ("Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and shall become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation



                                       3

Common Stock") as of the Effective Time, and the Surviving Corporation shall
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

                  (f) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to
purchase, right to receive or other equity grant whose value is derived from
Company Common Stock (a "Company Stock Option") issued pursuant to the (i)
Amended and Restated 1996 Stock Option Plan of the Company, and (ii) the 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Plans"), whether
vested or unvested, shall be deemed to be cancelled and of no further force or
effect.

                                             by the Company from January 1, 2002

                                             Time (i.e., an additional account

                                    (f)      write-offs to reserves for

                                             by the Company from January 1, 2002
                                             through the effective Time (the
                                             "Threshold");

                           shall be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock
                           (with the Parent Shares being valued at the FMV of
                           the Parent Shares (as defined below);

                                    Time, to the extent that the sum of (a) the

                                    than $510,000, then such differential shall
                                    be paid to the holders of Company Common

                                    however, that if there is no such
                                    differential in the calculation described in
                                    (i) above, then the amount of the shortfall
                                    from the Threshold shall be subtracted from
                                    the amounts otherwise payable in this
                                    subpart (ii);

                                    shall be reduced by an amount equal to 75%
                                    of the dollar amount over $100,000 of any
                                    sales and use tax liability assessed against
                                    the Company by the State of Nevada as a

                                    it being agreed and understood that the
                                    Company shall use all commercially
                                    reasonable efforts to settle such issues
                                    prior to the Effective Time; and

                           (iv)     in addition to (iii) above, and
                                    notwithstanding (i) and (ii) above, to the
                                    extent that the consolidated financial
                                    statements included in the Company's 2001

                                    $2,010,204, excluding net receivables and
                                    net inventory, then 50% of such deficit
                                    shall be deducted from any amounts payable
                                    to the holders of Company Common Stock
                                    pursuant to (i) and (ii) above.

A worksheet and example of certain of the mechanics of this subsection 1.7(a) is
attached hereto as Exhibit B.

         In the event there is a dispute between Parent and the Representative
Stockholder (as defined below) with respect to the Hold-Back Amount, Parent and
the Representative Stockholder shall attempt in good faith to reconcile their
differences, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties. If Parent and the Representative
Stockholder are unable to reach a resolution of such dispute within thirty days
after the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and Seller shall
submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to a mutually agreed upon
independent public accountant, which shall act as arbitrator and shall promptly
as practicable after submission, determine and report to the parties upon such
remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive
on the parties. Parent and the Representative Stockholder shall provide the
independent public accountant with such information, and shall afford such
accountants such access to books and records of the parties, as such accountants
may reasonably request. The fees of the independent public accountant in
connection with such determination shall be shared equally by Parent and the
Company, with the Company's portion being deducted from the Hold-Back Amount.

         In no event shall the amounts payable to the holders of Company Common
Stock under this Section 1.7 exceed the Hold-Back Amount.

                  (b) Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the account receivables and
sell the inventory referred to in subsection (a) above and at least the same
efforts as it uses in its own affairs of a similar nature. In addition,
following the Effective Time, if the Surviving Corporation sells the cellular
business currently conducted by the Company, then the Surviving Corporation will
allocate the sales price for the assets in such sale on a fair market value
basis (including any account receivables and inventory included in such sale)
(the "Asset FMV"). The Surviving Corporation will make a determination of the
Asset FMV and deliver the same to the Representative Stockholder. The
Representative Stockholder will thereafter have thirty days to accept or reject
the Surviving Corporation's determination of Asset FMV (or during such period,
the Surviving Corporation and Representative Stockholder shall have mutually
agreed to a different Asset FMV). If within such thirty day period the
Representative Stockholder rejects the Company's determination of Asset FMV or
the Representative Stockholder and the Surviving Corporation do not mutually
agree on an alternative Asset FMV, then the Representative Stockholder and the
Surviving Corporation shall submit the agreement to a mutually acceptable
appraiser (the "Appraiser"). The Appraiser will have 20 days thereafter to
determine the Asset FMV, which determination shall be in writing and shall be
considered final and binding on all parties.

                  (c) The determination of whether to take Parent Shares or Cash
Consideration for any post-Effective Time payout as provided in this Section 1.7
shall be



                                       6
<PAGE>

determined by the Representative Stockholder. The Representative Stockholder
shall have ten business days following written notice by Parent that an amount
is owed to the holders of Company Common Stock under this Section 1.7, to make
an election in writing to Parent as to taking Parent Shares and/or Cash
Consideration from the held-back amounts under this Section 1.7. If the
Representative Stockholder fails to make such election within such ten-day
period, then Parent may, in its sole discretion, make such payment in Parent
Shares and/or cash.

                  (d) (i) The Representative Stockholder shall initially be
Peter Gotcher and may be changed by a majority of the then-existing Stockholder
Representatives, in their sole discretion, upon notice to Parent by such
persons, which written notice shall provide the address of such new
Representative Stockholder. The Stockholder Representatives shall initially be
the members of the Company's Board of Directors immediately prior to the
Effective Time and may be changed by a majority of the then-existing Stockholder
Representatives, in their sole discretion, upon written notice to Parent by such
persons, which written notice shall provide the address(es) of any such new
Stockholder Representative(s). The Representative Stockholder's address is set
forth in Section 8.4(c) below.

                           (ii) The Representative Stockholder shall perform his
or her functions under this Section 1.7 at the direction and upon the
determination or agreement of a majority of the then-existing Stockholder
Representatives (including the Representative Stockholder). Stockholder
Representatives are authorized and empowered to construe this Agreement and
their construction made in good faith shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Company Stockholders and upon all parties hereto. Each Stockholder
Representative shall always be protected and free from liability in acting upon
any notice, request, consent, certificate, declaration, telegram, telex,
facsimile, guarantee, affidavit or other paper or document or signature or
signature believed by him, her or any of them to be genuine and to have been
signed by the proper party or parties or by the party or parties purporting to
have signed the same. No Stockholder Representative shall be liable for any
error of judgment nor for any act done or omitted, nor for any mistake of fact
or law nor for anything which he or she may do or refrain from doing in good
faith consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, nor shall any
Stockholder Representative have any accountability hereunder to Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Company or to the Company Stockholders. The
Stockholder Representatives may consult with legal counsel, which may be counsel
to the Company prior to the Effective Time, and any action authorized by this
Agreement, which is taken or suffered in good faith by the Stockholder
Representatives in accordance with the advice of such counsel shall be
conclusive upon the parties hereto, and the Stockholder Representatives shall be
fully protected and be subject to no liability with respect thereto. For
purposes of this Section, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
hereby waive any conflict of interest that may arise in connection with the
Stockholder Representatives' retention of counsel in connection with the
interpretation and performance of this Agreement by reason of such counsel's
representation of the Company prior to the Effective Time.

                           (iii) Any Stockholder Representative, employee or
agent and any firm, corporation, partnership, trust, or association of which
such Stockholder Representative may be a member, trustee, shareholder, director,
officer, partner, agent or employee may contract with or be or become
pecuniarily interested, directly or indirectly, in any matter or transaction to
which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any controlled or affiliated
corporation may be a



                                       7
<PAGE>

party or in which it may be concerned, as fully and freely as though such
Stockholder Representative were not a Stockholder Representative hereunder. Any
Stockholder Representative, his or her employees or agents may act as directors
and/or officers of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or of such controlled or
affiliated corporation without regard to his or her status as a Stockholder
Representative.

         Section 1.8 Valuation of Parent Shares. The term "FMV of the Parent
Shares" shall mean the average closing price of the Parent Common Stock for the
30 calendar day period immediately preceding the Effective Time.

                                   ARTICLE II
                            EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

         Section 2.1 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint an exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates
for the Merger Consideration (the "Exchange Agent"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, certificates representing
the shares of Parent Common Stock and the Cash Consideration (excluding the
Potential Adjustment Amounts) issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (collectively,
the "Initial Consideration") in exchange for outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to make cash payments pursuant to Section 2.5
in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and
certificates representing Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

         Section 2.2 Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Certificate
(i) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon due
delivery of the Certificates and other required documents to the Exchange Agent,
and which letter shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender
of such Certificates in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefore (A) a certificate representing one or more shares of Parent Common
Stock representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(a) (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder), (B) a
check in an amount that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.6(a) (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by
such holder), and (C) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required
tax withholdings) equal to the cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and any unpaid dividends and other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the



                                       8
<PAGE>

transfer records of the Company prior to the Effective Time, one or more
certificates evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash, and a second check in the
proper amount of cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3 may be issued with respect to such
Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the Certificate representing such
shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the ownership
of such shares of Company Common Stock by such transferee and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

         Section 2.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Stock. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to the Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of
such Certificate pursuant to the Merger and no cash payment, or cash payment in
lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock, shall be paid to any such
holder pursuant to Section 2.5 until such holder shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the
amount of any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.5 in lieu of issuing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would be entitled and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

         Section 2.4 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued and cash paid upon conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article
II (including any stock dividends or cash paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or cash
paid pursuant to Section 2.5) shall be issued or paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock.

         Section 2.5 No Fractional Shares of Parent Common Stock.

                  (a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.

                  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
(other than the last sentence of this Section 2.5(b)), each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall be entitled
to receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock and (ii)
the average



                                       9
<PAGE>

closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market System
("Nasdaq") for the 20 trading days prior to and ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Average Price"). As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to
holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and
Parent shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing contained in this Section 2.5(b), Parent shall be entitled at its
option to deliver a full share of Parent Common Stock in lieu of any fractional
share of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable to a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

         Section 2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for 12 months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
3.4) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto.

         Section 2.7 No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Merger Consideration or any cash in respect of dividends or other
distributions from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         Section 2.8 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be
paid to Parent. Parent shall ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
sufficient to satisfy Parent's obligations under this Agreement and shall
promptly and proportionately replenish the Exchange Fund upon its suffering of
any losses resulting from the Exchange Agent's investment activities with
respect thereto if necessary to ensure sufficient funds.

         Section 2.9 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect
to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in
respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement.

         Section 2.10 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other
provision of applicable law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

         Section 2.11 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Sub, any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in Parent or in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

         Section 2.12 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration and as otherwise provided herein. Subject to Sections
2.6 and 2.7, on or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into the Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5)
and shall represent the right to receive dividends or other distributions to
which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.

         Section 2.13 Certain Adjustments. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class of
stock by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend
payable in any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such
period, or any similar event shall have occurred, the shares of Parent Common
Stock included in the Merger Consideration, and the 3,100,000 figure, $1.00
share price and Average Closing Price set forth in Section 7.1(g) shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same
economic effect, voting rights and other terms and designations as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to any such event.

         Section 2.14 Appraisal Rights.

                  (a) The parties acknowledge that the Company's stockholders
are currently not entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.
However, to the extent that at



                                       11
<PAGE>

any point such appraisal rights become available in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties intend for paragraphs
(b) and (c) below to apply.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company for which, as of the
Company stockholders' meeting called to approve the Merger (the "Company
Stockholders' Meeting"), the holder thereof has demanded an appraisal of their
value in accordance with applicable law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6, and the holder or holders of such
shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or
holders under applicable law; provided, however, that if the status of any such
shares as Dissenting Shares shall not be perfected in accordance with applicable
law, or if any such shares shall lose their status as Dissenting Shares then, as
of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such
status or the loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted
into and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares) the applicable Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 1.6. In the event of any Dissenting
Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration will be deemed to be reduced by the
proportional share of the Merger Consideration that the holders of such
Dissenting Shares would be entitled to receive absent the appraisal.

                  (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demand received by the Company at or prior to the Company Stockholders'
Meeting to require the Company to purchase Dissenting Shares pursuant to
applicable law and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer.

                                  ARTICLE III
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

         The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article III are true and correct, except as set
forth in the disclosure statement delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger
Sub concurrently herewith (the "Company Disclosure Statement"). All exceptions
noted in the Company Disclosure Statement shall be numbered to correspond to the
applicable Sections to which such exception refers.

         Section 3.1 Organization. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is a
corporation or other business organization duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries (i) is qualified or
licensed in all jurisdictions where such qualification or license is required to
own and operate its properties and conduct its business in the manner and at the
places presently conducted; (ii) holds all franchises, grants, licenses,
certificates, permits, consents and orders, all of which are valid and in full
force and effect, from all applicable United States and foreign regulatory

power



                                       12
<PAGE>

and authority (corporate and other) to own, lease and operate its respective
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and as
proposed to be conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to hold such franchises, grants, licenses, certificates, permits,
consents and orders or to have such power and authority would not, when taken
together with all other such failures, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the Company. The Company
has furnished to Parent complete and correct copies of its and its subsidiaries'
certificates of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. Such
certificate of incorporation and bylaws are in full force and effect and no
other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company.
When used in connection with any person or any of its subsidiaries, the term
"Material Adverse Effect" means any change or effect that, either individually
or in the aggregate with all other related changes or effects, (i) is materially
adverse to the business, operations, assets, liabilities (including contingent
liabilities), condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or
prospects of such person and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) could
reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of such person to
consummate the Merger and to perform its other obligations hereunder on a timely
basis.

         Section 3.2 Capital Structure.

                  (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of
50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred

bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having voting rights (or
convertible or exchangeable into securities having such rights) ("Voting Debt")
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries issued and outstanding. There are no
shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company. Except as
set forth above, as set forth in Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure

(ii) there are no existing (A) options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights,
subscriptions or other rights, convertible or exchangeable securities,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character, relating to the issued
or unissued capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, obligating
the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell or cause to be
issued, transferred or sold any shares of capital stock or Voting Debt of, or
other equity interest in, the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (B) securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests or (C)

                                       13
<PAGE>

                  (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of
the Company's subsidiaries are beneficially owned by the Company, directly or
indirectly, and all such shares have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by either the Company or one of its subsidiaries
free and clear of all Liens.

                  (c) Other than the Voting Agreement, there are no voting
trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries. None of the Company or its subsidiaries is a
party to any agreement or obligation, contingent or otherwise, to redeem,
repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire shares of capital stock of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, whether as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or otherwise.

                  (d) Since January 1, 2002, the Company has not (i) made or
agreed to make any stock split or stock dividend, or issued or permitted to be
issued any shares of capital stock, or securities exercisable for or convertible

required by the terms of any Company Stock Option, (ii) repurchased, redeemed or
otherwise acquired any shares of capital stock of the Company or (iii) declared,

         Section 3.3 Corporate Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company
Action.

                  (a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the necessary
approval of its stockholders as contemplated by Section 5.2(b) with respect to
the Merger, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation
by it of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly
authorized by its Board of Directors and, except for obtaining the approval of
its stockholders as contemplated by Section 5.2(b) with respect to the Merger,
no other corporate action or proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
this Agreement constitutes valid and binding obligations of Parent and Sub, as
applicable, constitutes valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
affecting creditor' rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance
and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefore may be brought.

                  (b) The Board of Directors of the Company has duly and validly
approved and taken all corporate action required to be taken by the Board of
Directors (in each case by a unanimous vote of all the directors in office at
such time) for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, but not limited to, (i) having determined that this
Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are
advisable and



                                       14
<PAGE>

are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii)
having resolved to recommend that the holders of the shares of Company Common
Stock adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and (iii) having taken all
actions necessary to render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL
inapplicable to this Agreement. The affirmative vote in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement by stockholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of Company capital stock necessary to approve
this Agreement and the Merger.

         Section 3.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except as set forth
in Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure Statement and for all filings, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required under, and compliance
with other applicable requirements of, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), state securities or "blue sky" laws, and for the
approval of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders and the filing and
recordation of this Agreement or the Certificate of Merger as required by the
DGCL, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement nor the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
nor compliance by the Company with any of the provisions hereof will (i) result
in any breach or violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws or similar organizational documents of the Company or of any of its
subsidiaries, (ii) require any filing with, or permit, authorization, consent or
approval of, any United States or foreign court, arbitral tribunal,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental or other regulatory
authority, body, commission or agency (a "Governmental Entity"), except where
the failure to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals or to
make such filings would not have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company, (iii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or increase in the
rate of interest) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, guarantee, other evidence of indebtedness, lease,
license, contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of
their properties or assets may be bound (a "Company Agreement") or result in the
creation of a Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries for violations, breaches, defaults, or rights of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Liens, which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company or (iv) violate any order, writ, injunction,
judgment, decree, statute, rule, regulation or law ("Law") applicable to the
Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets.

         Section 3.5 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

                  (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports, statements,
schedules, registration statements and other documents required to be filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since October 13, 1999 (the
"Company SEC Documents"), each of which complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in
effect on the date so filed. No subsidiary of the Company is required to file
any form, report,



                                       15
<PAGE>

statement, schedule, registration statement or other document with the SEC. No
Company SEC Document, when filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the Closing Date, then on the date of such filing) contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (b) Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Company (including any related notes thereto) included in the
Company SEC Documents have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), applied on a consistent basis
during the relevant periods (except as may be disclosed in the notes thereto),
and present fairly the consolidated financial position and consolidated results
of operations and changes in cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries as
of the respective dates or for the respective periods reflected therein, except,
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, for normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that are not material.

                  (c) Except to the extent set forth on the consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2001, included in
the Company SEC Documents (the "Latest Balance Sheet"), or in the notes thereto,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities, debts,
claims or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, direct or
indirect, contingent or otherwise, whether due or to become due), and there is
no existing condition or set of circumstances which would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in such a liability,
except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2001, none of which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company.

         Section 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes. Since September 30, 2001, there
has not occurred any event, change, circumstance, condition or effect (including
the incurrence of any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise) having or reasonably likely to have, in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company. Since September 30, 2001,
the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice. Since September 30, 2001,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries have taken any action which if
taken after the date hereof but prior to Closing would have been prohibited by
Section 5.1 (a), (b), (c)(ii), (c)(iii), (c)(iv), (c)(v), (e), (f)(ii), (g),
(h), (l), (m), (o), (p) or (q) (except that with respect to 5.1(q) the dollar
amount shall be increased to $150,000) hereof.

         Section 3.7 Information Supplied. None of the information supplied by
the Company for inclusion in (i) the registration statement on Form S-4 to be
filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of the Parent
Common Stock in the Merger (such Form S-4, as amended or supplemented, is herein
referred to as the "Form S-4") will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the
SEC, and at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the proxy
statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the
Stockholders Meeting (as defined in Section 5.2(b)) (such proxy statement,



                                       16
<PAGE>

as amended or supplemented, is herein referred to as the "Proxy
Statement/Prospectus") will, at the date the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, or contain any statement which at the time and in the light of the
circumstances under which it is made is false or misleading with respect to any
material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein not false or misleading or necessary to correct any statement
in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of a proxy for the
Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading. No representation is
made by the Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied
in writing by Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation in the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

former director, officer, employee, or service provider of the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate, or the dependents of any thereof, regardless of how (or
whether) liabilities for the provision of benefits are accrued or assets are
acquired or dedicated with respect to the funding thereof (collectively the
"Employee Plans"). No Employee Plan is (w) a "Defined Benefit Plan" (as defined
in Section 414(l) of the Code), (x) a plan intended to meet the requirements of
Section 401(a) of the Code, (y) a "Multiemployer Plan" (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA), or (z) a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, other than a
Multiemployer Plan. Also set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure
Statement is a complete and correct list of all ERISA Affiliates of the Company
during the last six years.

                  (b) The Company has delivered to Parent true, accurate and
complete copies of (i) the documents comprising each Employee Plan (or, with
respect to any Employee Plan which is unwritten, a detailed written description
of eligibility, participation, benefits, funding arrangements, assets and any
other matters which relate to the obligations of the



                                       17
<PAGE>

Company or any ERISA Affiliate), (ii) all trust agreements, insurance contracts
or any other funding instruments related to the Employee Plans, (iii) all
rulings, determination letters, no-action letters or advisory opinions from the
IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity that pertain
to each Employee Plan and any open requests therefore, (iv) the most recent
actuarial and financial reports (audited and/or unaudited) and the annual
reports filed with any Governmental Entity with respect to the Employee Plans
during the current year and each of the three preceding years, (v) all
collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which contributions to any Employee
Plan(s) have been made or obligations incurred (including both pension and
welfare benefits) by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, and all collective
bargaining agreements pursuant to which contributions are being made or
obligations are owed by such entities, (vi) all securities registration
statements filed with respect to any Employee Plan, (vii) all contracts with
third-party administrators, actuaries, investment managers, consultants, and
other independent contractors that relate to any Employee Plan, and (viii) all
summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications and memoranda,
employee handbooks and other written communications regarding the Employee
Plans.

                  (c) Except as disclosed in Section 3.8 of the Company
Disclosure Statement, full payment has been made of all amounts that are
required under the terms of each Employee Plan to be paid as contributions with
respect to all periods prior to and including the last day of the most recent
fiscal year of such Employee Plan ended on or before the date of this Agreement
and all periods thereafter prior to the Closing Date. The Company has paid in
full all required insurance premiums, subject only to normal retrospective
adjustments in the ordinary course, with regard to the Employee Plans for all
policy years or other applicable policy periods ending on or before the
Effective Date.

                  (d) The Company has, at all times, complied, and currently
complies, in all material respects with the applicable continuation requirements
for its welfare benefit plans, including (1) Section 4980B of the Code (as well
as its predecessor provision, Section 162(k) of the Code) and Sections 601
through 608, inclusive, of ERISA, which provisions are hereinafter referred to
collectively as "COBRA" and (2) any applicable state statutes mandating health
insurance continuation coverage for employees.

                  (e) The form of all Employee Plans is in compliance with the
applicable terms of ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable laws, including
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical Leave Act of
1993 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and
such plans have been operated in compliance with such laws and the written
Employee Plan documents. Neither the Company nor any fiduciary of an Employee
Plan has violated the requirements of Section 404 of ERISA. All required reports
and descriptions of the Employee Plans (including Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan
Descriptions and Summaries of Material Modifications) have been (when required)
timely filed with the IRS, the U. S. Department of Labor, or other Governmental
Entity and distributed as required, and all notices required by ERISA or the
Code or any other legal requirement with respect to the Employee Plans have been
appropriately given.

                  (f) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS, and the Company



                                       18
<PAGE>

does not have any knowledge of any circumstances that will or could result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter.

                  (g) There is no material pending or, to the Company's
knowledge, threatened proceeding relating to any Employee Plan, nor is the
Company aware of any basis for any such proceeding. Neither the Company nor any
fiduciary of an Employee Plan has engaged in a transaction with respect to any
Employee Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject the Company or Parent to a Tax or penalty
imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(l) of ERISA or a

of the Company Disclosure Statement, there is no claim, suit, action, proceeding
or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against

and adequate reserves are provided in the Company's financial statements for
Taxes owing but not yet due. There is (i) no material claim for Taxes that is a

limitations on the assessment of any Taxes granted by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is currently in effect. Neither the Company nor any of its

Laws. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has been or will be
required to include any material adjustment in Taxable income for any Tax period

Tax allocation agreement nor does the Company or any subsidiary have any

applicable. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are aware of any
investigation pending, threatened, or likely to be commenced by any Tax
Authority for any jurisdiction where the Company and its subsidiaries do not

such Tax Authority that the Company or any subsidiary is or may be subject to
such Tax in such jurisdiction, and none of the Company and its subsidiaries is
aware of any meritorious basis for such an investigation.

Parent SEC Document, when filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior

statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

thereto, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has any liabilities, debts,
claims or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, direct or
indirect, contingent or otherwise, whether due or to become due), and there is
no existing condition or set of circumstances which would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in such a liability,
except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice since September 30, 2001, none of which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to Parent.

date of this Agreement and prior to the Company Stockholder Approval; provided
further, however, that prior to participating in any such discussions or
negotiations or furnishing any information, (i) the Company receives from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided to

good faith, that such Transaction Proposal is reasonably likely to be or to
result in a Superior Proposal, and based on the written advice of its outside
legal counsel, that participating in such negotiations or discussions or
furnishing such information is required in order to prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from breaching its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under the DGCL; and provided, further, that the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take any of the foregoing actions unless it

information in the possession of any such party or in the possession of any
agent or advisor of any such party. The Company agrees not to release any third
party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill

have concluded in good faith is reasonably capable of being completed, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
Transaction Proposal and the person making the proposal, and would, if

by this Agreement.

         Section 8.7 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreements (including the exhibits hereto and
the documents and the instruments referred to herein and therein): (a)
constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and (b) except as provided in Section 5.10 with respect
to the obligations of Parent thereunder, are not intended to confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.

         Section 8.8 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

         Section 8.9 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was
not per-formed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be
entitled to the remedy of specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition
to any other remedy at law or equity.

         Section 8.10 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to
Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; provided,

therein. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party at
the address referred to in Section 8.4, together with written notice of such
