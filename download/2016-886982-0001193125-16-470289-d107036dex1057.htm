of the terms of this Award Agreement, including the arbitration and choice of forum provisions in Paragraph 14. Within 30 days of the Date of Grant, you must make a Section&nbsp;83(b) Election, which will result in your recognition of taxable income
on the Date of Grant equal to the fair market value of the Restricted Shares on the Date of Grant, but will not affect the removal of the Transfer Restrictions. </B></P>

Date. Any purported sale, exchange, transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation, fractionalization, hedge or other disposition in violation of the Transfer Restrictions will be void. Within 30 Business Days after the Transferability Date listed on
your Award Statement (or any other date on which the Transfer Restrictions are to be removed), GS Inc. will remove the Transfer Restrictions. The Committee or the SIP Committee may select multiple dates within such 30 Business-Day-period on which to
remove Transfer Restrictions for all or a portion of the Restricted Shares with the same Transferability Date listed on the Award Statement, and all such dates will be treated as a single Transferability Date for purposes of this Award.<B> </B></P>

Shares into an escrow account in accordance with Paragraph 11(f)(v) or (c)&nbsp;apply Transfer Restrictions to any Short-Term Restricted Shares in connection with any investigation of whether any of the events that result in forfeiture under the
Plan or this Paragraph 8 have occurred. Paragraph 10 (relating to certain circumstances under which release of Transfer Restrictions may be accelerated) provides for exceptions to one or more provisions of this Paragraph 8. The Code Staff Forfeiture
and Repayment Appendix supplements this Paragraph 8 and sets forth additional events that result in forfeiture of up to all of your Short-Term Restricted Shares and may require repayment to the Firm as described in Paragraph 9 and the Appendix. <B>
