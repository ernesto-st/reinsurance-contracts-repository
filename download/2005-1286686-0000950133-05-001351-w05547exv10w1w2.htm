<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ADVANCES</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1.01. <U>Commitments to Lend; Limits on Lenders&#146; Obligations</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Advances</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, from time to time prior to the Facility Termination Date, Issuer may request to the
Administrative Agent and each Funding Agent that each Conduit Lender make loans to Issuer secured
by the Collateral (each, an &#147;<U>Advance</U>&#148;). Each requested Advance shall be
allocated among the Lender Groups based upon each Lender Group&#146;s Pro Rata Share. Each Funding
Agent shall allocate, in its sole discretion, each request for an Advance among the Conduit Lenders
in the Lender Group to which such Funding Agent is party. Each Conduit Lender may, in its sole
discretion, make such Advances in an amount up to the amount specified by the Funding Agent in its
Lender Group, and if a Conduit Lender elects not to make any amount of such Advance, the Committed
Lenders in such Conduit Lender&#146;s Lender Group shall fund the amount of such Advance that is not
made by such Conduit Lender, each in an amount equal to its respective Lender Group Pro Rata Share
of such Advance; <U>provided</U> that no Advance shall be made by a Lender if, after
giving effect thereto, (i)&nbsp;the then Total Outstanding Advances would exceed the Program Limit at
such time and (ii)&nbsp;in respect of any Lender Group, the then Total Outstanding Advances held by all
Lenders in such Lender Group would exceed such Lender Group&#146;s Group Limit at such time.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Committed Lender shall be
obligated to provide the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent or Issuer with aggregate funds in
connection with a Borrowing in an amount that would exceed such Committed Lender&#146;s unused
Commitment then in effect less any amounts advanced by such Committed Lender pursuant to a Program
Support Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Use of Proceeds</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the proceeds of each Advance made pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;1.01(a)</U> shall be
used by Issuer only for the purchase of Student Loans pursuant to the CFO Purchase and Sale
Agreement or to make deposits to the Collection Account to be applied as permitted pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U> to the extent that Collections are insufficient to pay amounts
described in clauses <U>first</U> through <U>eighth</U> of <U>Section
3.03(b)</U> and the proceeds of each Advance made pursuant to <U>Section
1.01(c)</U> shall be used by Issuer only as provided in <U>Section&nbsp;1.01(c)</U>;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, in the case of the first Borrowing
hereunder, such proceeds (or a portion thereof) may be used to fund the Reserve Account so that the
amount therein at least equals the Reserve Account Minimum Balance.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Additional Advances</U>. In addition to Advances pursuant to
<U>Section&nbsp;1.01(a)</U>, absent written notice from the Required Lenders that such
Advances will not be made, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Termination and so long as no
Event of Termination would occur as a result of such Advances on each Settlement Date, each Conduit
Lender may (in its sole discretion) and each Committed Lender shall (to the extent any Conduit
Lender in such Committed Lender&#146;s Lender Group elects not to make such Advances) make Advances in
an aggregate amount equal to all amounts described in the <U>first</U> through
<U>eighth</U> clauses of <U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U> that remain unpaid after
the application of funds from Collections and Available Funds

pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U>. On each Settlement Date after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Termination, absent written notice from the Required Lenders
that such Advances shall not be made, each Conduit Lender may (in its sole discretion) and each
Committed Lender shall (to the extent any Conduit Lender in such Committed Lender&#146;s Lender Group
elects not to make such Advances) make Advances in an aggregate amount equal to all amounts
described in the <U>first</U> through <U>sixth</U> clauses of
<U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U> and all amounts related to independent directors&#146; fees described
in the <U>seventh</U> clause of <U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U> which remain unpaid
after the application of funds from Collections and Available Funds on deposit in the Collection
Account pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U>. Each Conduit Lender may make an Advance
under this <U>Section&nbsp;1.01(c)</U> in its sole discretion. If a Conduit Lender elects
not to make such Advance, the Committed Lenders in such Conduit Lender&#146;s Lender Group shall fund
such Advance, each in an amount equal to its respective Lender Group Pro Rata Share of such
Advance; <U>provided</U>, that no Advance shall be made by a Lender pursuant to this
<U>Section&nbsp;1.01(c)</U> to the extent the Required Lenders have provided written notice
to the Administrative Agent that they will not make such Advances; <U>provided</U>,
<U>further</U>, that no Advance shall be made by a Lender if, after giving effect
thereto, (i)&nbsp;in respect of all Lenders, the then Total Outstanding Advances would exceed the
Program Limit at such time or (ii)&nbsp;in respect of any Lender Group, the then aggregate outstanding
Advances with respect to all Lenders in such Lender Group would exceed the Group Limit for such
Lender Group at such time. Advances made pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.01(c)</U> shall
constitute &#147;Advances&#148; as such term is used in this Agreement and shall be secured by the
Collateral. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no Committed
Lender shall be obligated to provide any Funding Agent, the Administrative Agent or Issuer with
aggregate funds in connection with a Borrowing (x)&nbsp;after such Lender&#146;s Facility Termination Date or
(y)&nbsp;in an amount that would exceed such Committed Lender&#146;s unused Commitment then in effect less
any amounts advanced by such Committed Lender pursuant to a Program Support Agreement. The
Indenture Trustee shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Funding Agents in writing two
Business Days prior to each Settlement Date if the amounts on deposit in the Collection Account
will be insufficient to pay in full the amounts described in the <U>first</U> through
<U>eighth</U> clauses of <U>Section&nbsp;3.03(b)</U>. Each Funding Agent will
promptly notify the Conduit Lenders in such Funding Agent&#146;s Lender Group or the Committed Lenders
in such Funding Agent&#146;s Lender Group, as applicable, of such Funding Agent&#146;s receipt of any such
notice. Each Lender shall instruct its related Funding Agent as to whether such Lender will fund
the proposed Borrowing by telephone or telecopy by no later than the close of its business on the
Business Day following its receipt of any such request.

notice, substantially in the form of Exhibit&nbsp;1.02 (a &#147;<U>Borrowing Notice</U>&#148;),
delivered to the Administrative Agent, the Funding Agents and the Indenture Trustee in accordance

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Accounts</U>. On or before the first Borrowing Date, the Indenture Trustee
shall establish, for the benefit of the Lenders to the extent of its interests therein as provided
herein, the Disbursement Account, the Collection Account, the Reserve Account and the Residual
Payments Account, which accounts shall be segregated accounts maintained at a Qualified Institution
selected by the Issuer and approved by the Administrative Agent and each Funding Agent. Each such
Account shall be subject to the sole dominion and control (as defined in Section&nbsp;8-106 of the UCC)
of the Indenture Trustee and neither the Issuer nor any Affiliate of the Issuer shall have any
withdrawal rights therefrom, except as expressly permitted under this Agreement and the Residual
Payments Account Control Agreement with respect to the Residual Payments Account. The Eligible
Investments and funds in each such Account shall be deemed &#147;financial assets&#148; as defined in Section
8-102 of the UCC. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee agree to
enter into the Account Control Agreement with respect to each such Account as of the date hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the further provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;3.01</U>, the Indenture
Trustee shall, upon receipt, deposit into such Accounts all amounts received by it which are
required to
be deposited therein in accordance with the provisions hereof. All such amounts and all
investments made with such amounts, including all income and other gains from such investments,
shall be held by the Indenture Trustee in such Accounts as part of the Collateral as herein
provided, subject to withdrawal by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with, and for the purposes
specified in the provisions of, this Agreement and, with respect to the Residual Payments Account,
subject to withdrawal by CFS or the Issuer in accordance with the Residual Payments Account Control
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Administration of Payments</U>. Unless otherwise advised by the
Administrative Agent in writing or required herein, the Indenture Trustee shall assume that any
amount remitted to it by the Master Servicer, any Sub-Servicer or the Issuer is to be deposited
into the Collection Account pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;3.03</U>. The Indenture Trustee may
establish from time to time such deadline or deadlines as it shall determine are reasonable or
necessary in the administration hereof after which all amounts received or collected by the
Indenture Trustee on any day shall not be deemed to have been received or collected until the next
succeeding Business Day.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>No Set-Off</U>. Neither the Eligible Lender Trustee nor the Indenture

by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to an Issuer Order in one or more Eligible Investments. Subject
to the restrictions on the maturity of investments set forth in <U>Section&nbsp;3.01(f)</U>,
each such Issuer Order may authorize the Indenture Trustee to make the specific Eligible
Investments set forth therein, to make Eligible Investments from time to time consistent with the
general instructions set forth therein, or to make specific Eligible Investments pursuant to
instructions received in writing or by facsimile transmission from the employees or agents of
Issuer identified therein, in each case in such amounts as such Issuer Order shall specify. All
income or other gains from the investment of moneys deposited in the Accounts shall be deposited by
the Indenture Trustee in the Collection Account upon receipt and shall be deemed to constitute a
portion of the Available Funds for the related Settlement Date. Issuer agrees to report as its
income for financial reporting and tax purposes (to the extent reportable) all Investment Earnings
on amounts in the Accounts. To the extent that the issuer of any Eligible Investment grants voting
rights to its holders, the Issuer (or, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Termination, the Administrative Agent) shall be responsible for exercising such voting rights.

there may be uninvested cash deposited in the Collection Account, Disbursement Account or Reserve
Account or (ii)&nbsp;an Event of Termination or Unmatured Event of Termination shall have occurred and
be continuing, then the Indenture Trustee shall invest such funds in Eligible Investments as
directed by the Administrative Agent by 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Business Day (to the
extent such investments are then available) or, if no such directions are given by such
time, in Eligible Investments described in <U>clause (a)</U> of the definition
thereof. All Eligible Investments made by the Indenture Trustee shall mature no later than the
maturity date therefor permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;3.01(f)</U>.

fees hereunder and under the other Transaction Documents to which Issuer is a party due on such
Settlement Date. The Issuer hereby agrees to deposit into the Collection Account an amount equal
to any breakage costs that are deducted from the proceeds of Eligible Investments in the event that
any Eligible Investment is needed to pay amounts due on a Settlement Date and had a maturity date
later than the Business Day prior to such Settlement Date.

days, or upon the earlier appointment and acceptance of a successor Indenture Trustee, as provided

Notwithstanding the foregoing, resignation of the Indenture Trustee shall not be effective until a

within one hundred twenty (120)&nbsp;days after giving such notice of resignation, the resigning
Indenture Trustee may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a

officer or officers, or of a receiver appointed by a court, a successor may be appointed by the
Administrative Agent and the Funding Agents with the consent (which consent shall not be

there shall be no violation of any law of any jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of
banking corporations or associations to transact business as the Indenture Trustee in such
jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document or any Student Loan or related agreement, and in particular in case of the
enforcement thereof on default, or in case of a conflict of interest, or in case the Indenture
Trustee deems that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction it may not exercise
any of the powers, rights or remedies herein granted to the Indenture Trustee or hold title to the
properties, in trust, as herein granted, or take any other action which may be desirable or
necessary in connection therewith, it may be necessary that the Indenture Trustee appoint an
additional institution, which must be a commercial bank with trust powers, as a separate or
co-trustee. The following provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;9.16</U> are intended to accomplish these
ends. In the event that the Indenture Trustee appoints an additional individual or institution as
a separate or co-trustee, each and every remedy, power, right, claim, demand, cause of action,
immunity, estate, title, interest and lien expressed or intended by this Agreement to be exercised
by or vested in or conveyed to the Indenture Trustee with respect thereto shall be exercisable by
and vest in such separate or co-trustee but only to the extent necessary to enable such separate or
co-trustee to exercise such powers, rights and remedies, and every covenant and obligation
necessary to the exercise thereof by such separate or co-trustee shall run to and be enforceable by
either of them.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should any instrument in writing from Issuer be required by the separate or co-trustee so
appointed by the Indenture Trustee for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him,
her or it such properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations, any and all such
instruments in writing shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by Issuer. In
case any separate or co-trustee, or a successor to either, shall die, become incapable of acting,
resign or be removed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations
of such separate or co-trustee, so far as permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by the
Indenture Trustee until the appointment of a new Indenture Trustee or a successor to such separate
or co-trustee.

change of the Indenture Trustee the predecessor which has resigned or been removed shall cease to
be trustee of any funds then held by it hereunder and the successor Indenture Trustee shall become
such trustee.

request of the Administrative Agent, any Funding Agent or Issuer or to institute or defend any suit
in respect hereof or to exercise any remedy hereunder unless properly indemnified to its
satisfaction subject to <U>Section&nbsp;9.07(i)</U> hereof. The Indenture Trustee shall not be
