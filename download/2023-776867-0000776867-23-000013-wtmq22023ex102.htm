Any Assets received by the Trustee  which are not in such proper negotiable form shall not be accepted by the Trustee and shall be  returned to the Grantor as unacceptable. The Trustee may hold Assets of the Supplemental Trust  Account in bearer form or in its own name or that of a nominee.    (e) The Trustee shall have no responsibility to determine whether the Assets in the  Supplemental Trust Account are sufficient to secure the Grantor's obligations to the Beneficiary.   Furthermore, the Trustee shall have no responsibility whatsoever to determine whether Assets  transferred to the Supplemental Trust Account constitute Eligible Assets.  SECTION 2. Withdrawal or Transfer of Assets from the Supplemental Trust Account.  (a) Without notice to the Grantor, the Beneficiary shall have the right, at any time and  from time to time, to withdraw from the Supplemental Trust Account, subject only to written  notice from the Beneficiary to the Trustee (the &#8220;Withdrawal Notice&#8221;), such Assets as are  specified in such Withdrawal Notice.  The Withdrawal Notice shall also specify instruction to the  Trustee as to how such specified Assets shall be delivered.  The Beneficiary may from time to  time designate a third party (the &#8220;Beneficiary Designee&#8221;) in a Withdrawal Notice to whom all or  part of the Assets specified therein shall be delivered. The Beneficiary shall not be required to  present any other statement or document in addition to a Withdrawal Notice in order to withdraw  any Assets, except that the Beneficiary shall acknowledge receipt of any such Assets withdrawn  upon request by the Trustee; nor is said right of withdrawal or any other provision of this  Supplemental Trust Agreement subject to any conditions or qualifications not contained in this  Supplemental Trust Agreement.

The  Trustee agrees to follow any investment instructions from the Asset Manager and to execute and  settle all such trades in the ordinary course.  The Grantor shall be responsible to ascertain  whether investments are &#8220;Eligible Assets&#8221;.  (c) From time to time, the Grantor may provide written instructions to the Trustee to  direct the Trustee to substitute other Eligible Assets for Assets presently held in the  Supplemental Trust Account; provided, however, that (i) such written instructions (A) certify  that the fair market values of the assets being substituted equals or exceeds the fair market value  of  the assets being withdrawn and (B) reference current information from an independent third- party pricing source that customarily values such assets, and (ii) the Beneficiary is promptly  </FONT></DIV>

The  Trustee shall also follow any instructions regarding substitution of assets that are signed by both  the Grantor and the Beneficiary.  (d) When the Trustee is directed to deliver or receive Assets against payment,  delivery will be made in accordance with generally accepted market practice.  SECTION 4. Trust Income.
