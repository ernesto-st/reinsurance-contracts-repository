SECTION D: PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

1. TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW
The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/03 through 9/30/06, with
two one-year options to renew. All contract renewals shall be through
contract amendment. AHCCCSA shall issue amendments prior to the end date
of the contract when there is an adjustment to capitation rates and/or changes
to the scope of service contained herein. Changes to scope of service include
but are not limited to changes in the enrolled population, changes in
covered services, changes in GSA's

If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such
contract will be considered separately renewable. AHCCCSA may renew the
Contractor's contract in one GSA, but not in another. In addition, if the
Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may
result in the capping of the Contractor's enrollment in all GSAs. Further,
AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to renew all currently awarded GSA's, or
may terminate the contract if the Contractor does not agree to renew all
currently awarded GSA's.

When AHCCCSA issues an amendment to the contract, the provisions of such renewal
will be deemed to have been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing by
AHCCCSA, even if the amendment has not been signed by the Contractor, unless
within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA in writing that it refuses to
sign the renewal amendment. If the Contractor provides such notification,
AHCCCSA will initiate contract termination proceedings.

Contractor's Notice of Intent Not To Renew: If the Contractor chooses not to
renew this contract, the Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated
with the transition of its members to a different health plan. If the
Contractor provides AHCCCSA written notice of its intent not to renew this
contract at least 180 days before its expiration, this liability for
transition costs may be waived by AHCCCSA.

Contract Termination: In the event the contract, or any portion thereof,
is terminated for any reason, or expires, the Contractor shall assist
AHCCCSA in the transition of its members to other contractors, and shall
abide by standards and protocols set forth in Paragraph 9, Transition of
Members. In addition, AHCCCSA reserves the right to extend the term of the
contract on a month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of
members. The Contractor shall make provision for continuing all management
and administrative services until the transition of all members is completed
and all other requirements of this contract are satisfied. The
Contractor shall be responsible for providing all reports set forth in this
contract and necessary for the transition process and shall be responsible
for the following:

a. Notification of subcontractors and members.
b. Payment of all outstanding obligations for medical care rendered to members.
c. Until AHCCCSA is satisfied that the Contractor has paid all such obligations,
   the Contractor shall provide the following reports to AHCCCSA:

(1) A monthly claims aging report by provider/creditor including IBNR amounts;
(2) A monthly summary of cash disbursements;
(3) Copies of all bank statements received by the Contractor.

d. Such reports shall be due on the fifth day of each succeeding month for the
   prior month.
e. In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCSA, such
   termination or suspension shall not affect the obligation of the Contractor
   to indemnify AHCCCSA for any claim by any third party against the State or
   AHCCCSA arising from the Contractor's performance of this contract and for
   which the Contractor would otherwise be liable under this contract.
f. Any dispute by the Contractor, with respect to termination or suspension of
   this contract by AHCCCSA, shall be exclusively governed by the provisions
   of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.

				-15-

g. Any funds, advanced to the Contractor for coverage of members for periods
   after the date of termination, shall be returned to AHCCCSA within 30 days
   of termination of the contract.

2. ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES
AHCCCS is Arizona's Title XIX Medicaid program operating under an 1115 Waiver
and Title XXI program operating under Title XXI State Plan authority. Arizona
has the authority to require mandatory enrollment in managed care. All members
eligible for AHCCCS benefits, with few exceptions, are enrolled in acute care
health plans and paid for on a capitated basis. AHCCCSA pays for health care
expenses on a fee for service (FFS) basis for Title XIX and Title XXI eligible
members who receive services through the Indian Health Service; for Title XIX
eligible members who are entitled to emergency services under the Federal
Emergency Services (FES) program; for Medicare cost sharing beneficiaries under
QMB programs; and for the State Emergency Services (SES) Program.

The following describes the eligibility groups enrolled in the managed care
program and covered under this contract.

Title XIX
1931 (Also referred to as TANF): Eligible individuals and families under the
1931 provision of the Social Security Act, with household income levels at
or below 100% of the FPL.

SSI and SSI Related Groups: Eligible individuals receiving Supplemental Security
Income (SSI) or who are aged, blind or disabled with household income levels at
or below 100% of the FPL.

Freedom to Work (Ticket to Work): Eligible individuals under the Title XIX
expansion program that extends eligibility to individuals, 16 through 64 years
old who meet SSI disability criteria, whose earned income, after allowable
deduction, is at or below 250% of the FPL and who are not eligible for any other
Medicaid program. These members must pay a premium to AHCCCSA ranging from
$10 to $35, depending on income.

SOBRA: Under the Sixth Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1986, eligible
pregnant women, with household income levels at or below 133% of the FPL,
and children in families with household incomes ranging from below 100% to
133% of the FPL, depending on the age of the child.

SOBRA Family Planning: Family planning extension program that covers the costs
for family planning services only, for a maximum of 24 months following the
loss of SOBRA eligibility.

Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP): Eligible individuals under
the Title XIX expansion program for women with income up to 250% of the FPL,
who are diagnosed with and need treatment for breast and/or cervical cancer
or cervical lesions and are not eligible for other Title XIX programs providing
full Title XIX services. Eligible members cannot have other creditable health
insurance coverage, including Medicare.

				-16-
<page>

Title XIX Waiver Group

Non-MED: Eligible individuals and couples whose income is at or below 100% of
the FPL, and who are not categorically linked to another Title XIX program.

MED: Eligible individuals and families whose income is above 100% of the FPL
with medical expenses that reduce income to or below 40% of the FPL.

Title XXI
KidsCare: Individuals under the age of 19, whose income does not exceed 200%
FPL. Children, in households with incomes between 150% and 200% of the FPL, may
participate in the KidsCare program, but are required to pay a premium amount
to AHCCCSA based on the number of children in the family and the gross family
income.

HIFA Parents: Non-Title XIX-eligible parents of KidsCare children or parents of
Title XIX children who are eligible under the HIFA demonstration initiative
waiver. HIFA parents are required to pay a premium to AHCCCSA ranging from $15
to $25 per parent (except Native American members). Due to funding
considerations, this program has an enrollment cap.

3. ENROLLMENT AND DISENROLLMENT
AHCCCSA has the exclusive authority to enroll and disenroll members. The
Contractor shall not disenroll any member for any reason unless directed to
do so by AHCCCSA. The Contractor may request AHCCCSA to change the member's
enrollment in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plan Change Policy.
AHCCCSA will disenroll the member when the member becomes ineligible for the
AHCCCS program, moves out of the health plan's service areas, changes
contractors during the member's open enrollment/annual enrollment choice period
or when approved for a health plan change through the AHCCCS Health Plan
Change Policy. Eligibility for the various AHCCCS coverage groups is determined
by one of the following agencies:

Social Security Administration (SSA)
SSA determines eligibility for the Supplemental Security Income
(SSI) cash program. SSI cash recipients are automatically
eligible for AHCCCS coverage.

Department of Economic Security (DES)
DES determines eligibility for the families with children under
section 1931 of the Social Security Act, pregnant women and
children under SOBRA, the Adoption Subsidy Program, Title IV-E
foster care children, Young Adult Transitional Insurance
Program, the Federal Emergency Services program (FES), HIFA
parents of SOBRA eligible children, the Title XIX Waiver
Members, and the State Emergency Services (SES) program.

				-17-
<page>

AHCCCSA
AHCCCSA determines eligibility for the SSI/Medical Assistance
Only groups, including the FES program for this population
(aged, disabled, blind), the Arizona Long-Term Care System
(ALTCS), the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary program and other
Medicare cost sharing programs, BCCTP, the Freedom to Work
program, the Title XXI KidsCare program, and HIFA parents of
KidsCare children.

AHCCCS acute care members are enrolled with Contractors in accordance with the
rules set forth in R9-22, Article 17, R9-31-306, 307, 309 and 1719.

Health Plan Choice

All AHCCCS members eligible for services covered under this contract have a
choice of available health plans. Information about these health plans will be
given to each applicant during the application process for AHCCCS benefits.
If there is only one health plan available for the applicant's Geographic
Service Area, no choice is offered as long as the health plan offers the member
a choice of PCPs. Members who do not choose prior to AHCCCSA being notified
of their eligibility, are automatically assigned to a health plan based on
family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm. See Section D, Paragraph 6,
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, for further explanation.

Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX members include
previously enrolled members who have been disenrolled for less than 90 days.
These members will be automatically enrolled with the same
Contractor, if still available. Members who have less than 30 days of continued
eligibility will not be enrolled with a Contractor, but will be placed on Fee
for Service. FES and SES members are not enrolled with a health
plan. Women, who become eligible for the Family Planning Services Extension
Program, will remain assigned to their current health plan.

The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX member with the Contractor
is the day AHCCCSA takes the enrollment action, generally the day prior to
the date the Contractor receives notification from AHCCCSA
via the daily roster. However, the Contractor is responsible for payment of
medically necessary covered services retroactive to the member's beginning
date of eligibility.

KidsCare members must select a health plan prior to being determined eligible
and therefore, will not be auto-assigned.
If the HIFA parent does not choose, they will be enrolled with their child's
health plan following the enrollment rules set forth in R9-31-1719. When a
member is transferred from Title XIX to Title XXI and has
not made a health plan choice for Title XXI, the member will remain with
their current health plan and a choice notice will be sent to the member.
The member may then change plans no later than 16 days from the
date the choice notice is sent.

The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member, including HIFA parents,
will be the first day of the month following notification to the health plan,
with few exceptions.

Prior Period Coverage: AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for the period of
time, prior to the Title XIX member's enrollment, during which a member is
eligible for covered services. The time frame is from the effective date of
eligibility to the day a member is enrolled with the Contractor. The Contractor
receives notification from the Administration of the member's enrollment. The
Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary
covered services provided to members during prior period coverage. This
may include services provided prior to the contract year (See Section D,
Paragraph 53, Compensation, for a description of the Contractor's reimbursement
from AHCCCSA for this eligibility time period.)

				-18-
<page>

Newborns:
Newborns, born to AHCCCS eligible mothers enrolled at the time of the child's
birth, will be enrolled with the mother's contractor, when newborn notification
is received by AHCCCSA. The Contractor is responsible for notifying AHCCCSA of
a child's birth to an enrolled member. Capitation for the newborn will begin
on the date notification is received by AHCCCSA (except for cases of births
during prior period coverage). The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be
the newborn's date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered
services to the newborn whether or not AHCCCSA has received notification of the
child's birth. AHCCCSA is currently available to receive notification calls 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.  Eligible mothers of newborns are sent a letter
advising them of their right to choose a different contractor for
their child; the date of the change will be the date of processing the
request from the mother. If the mother does not request a change, the child
will remain with the mother's contractor.

Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a contractor and mothers of these
newborns are sent a letter advising them of their right to choose a different
contractor for their child. In the event the FES mother chooses a different
contractor, AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned
contractor and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of birth in
the second contractor. The second contractor will receive prior period
capitation from the date of birth to the day before assignment and prospective
capitation from the date of assignment forward. The second contractor will be
responsible for all covered services to the newborn from date of birth.

Enrollment Guarantees:
Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible member, the member is
guaranteed a minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Upon initial
capitated enrollment as a Title XXI-eligible member, the member is guaranteed
a minimum of 12 full months of continuous enrollment. Enrollment guarantees do
not apply to HIFA parents. The enrollment guarantee is a one-time benefit. If a
member changes from one contractor to another within the enrollment guarantee
period, the remainder of the guarantee period applies to the new contractor.
The enrollment guarantee may not be granted or may be terminated if the member
is incarcerated or, if a minor child is adopted. AHCCCS Rule R9-22, Article 17
and R9-31, Article 3 describes other reasons for which the enrollment guarantee
may not apply.

Native Americans:
Native Americans, on or off-reservation, may choose to receive services from
Indian Health Service (IHS), a PL 93-638 tribal facility or any available
contractor. If a choice is not made within the specified time limit, Native
American Title XIX members living on-reservation will be assigned to IHS.
Native American Title XIX members living off-reservation will be assigned to an
available contractor using AHCCCS' Family Continuity Policy and auto-assignment
algorithm. Native American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being
determined eligible. Title XXI HIFA parent members' enrollment will
follow the Title XIX enrollment rules. Native Americans may change from IHS to
a contractor or from a contractor to IHS at any time.

4. ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE
AHCCCSA conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual
anniversary date. AHCCCSA may hold an open enrollment as deemed necessary.
During AEC, members may change contractors subject to the availability of
other contractors within their Geographic Service Area. Members are
mailed a printed enrollment form and other information required by the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) 60 days prior to their AEC date and may choose a new
contractor by contacting AHCCCSA to complete the enrollment process. If the
member does not participate in the AEC, no change of contractor will be made
(except for approved changes under the Change of Plan Policy) during the new
anniversary year. This holds true if a contractor's contract is renewed and
the member continues to live in a contractor's service area. The
Contractor shall comply with the AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care Member
Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice, Open Enrollment and Other Plan
Changes Policy and the AMPM.

				-19-
<page>

5. OPEN ENROLLMENT
In the event that AHCCCSA does not award a CYE '04 contract to an incumbent
contractor, AHCCCSA will hold an open enrollment for those members enrolled
with the exiting contractor. If those members do not elect
to choose a contractor, they will be auto assigned. In addition to open
enrollment, AHCCCSA will make changes to both annual enrollment choice
materials and new enrollee materials prior to October 1, 2003 to
reflect the change in available health plans. The auto assignment algorithm
will be adjusted to exclude auto assignment of new enrollees to exiting
contractors(s). The exact dates for the open enrollment and other changes
described above have not yet been determined, but will be communicated when
they are finalized.

6. AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM
Members who do not exercise their right to choose and do not have family
continuity, are assigned to a contractor through an auto-assignment algorithm.
The algorithm is a mathematical formula used to distribute members to the
various contractors in a manner that is predictable and consistent with
AHCCCSA goals. The algorithm favors those contractors with lower capitation
rates and higher program scores in the latest contract award. For further
details on the AHCCCS Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCSA
may change the algorithm at any time during the term of the contract in
response to contractor-specific issues (e.g. imposition of an enrollment cap).
The Contractor should consider this in preparing its response to this RFP.
Capitation rates may be adjusted to reflect changes to a contractor's risk due
to changes in the algorithm.

7. AHCCCS MEMBER IDENTIFICATION CARDS
Contractors are responsible for paying the costs of producing AHCCCS member
identification cards. The Contractor will receive an invoice the month
following the issue date of the identification card.

8. MAINSTREAMING OF AHCCCS MEMBERS
To ensure mainstreaming of AHCCCS members, the Contractor shall take affirmative
action so that members are provided covered services without regard to payer
source, race, color, creed, sex, religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
marital status, sexual preference, genetic information, or physical or mental
handicap, except where medically indicated. Contractors must take into account
a member's culture, when addressing members and their concerns, and must take
reasonable steps to encourage subcontractors to do the same. The
Contractor must make interpreters of any language available free of charge for
all members to ensure appropriate delivery of covered services. The Contractor
must provide members with information instructing them about how to access these
services.

Examples of prohibited practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

a. Denying or not providing a member any covered service or access to an
   available facility.
b. Providing to a member any covered service which is different, or is provided
   in a different manner or at a different time from that provided to other
   members, other public or private patients or the public at large, except
   where medically necessary.
c. Subjecting a member to segregation or separate treatment in any manner
   related to the receipt of any covered service; restricting a member in any
   way in his or her enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others
   receiving any covered service.
d. The assignment of times or places for the provision of services on the basis
   of the race, color, creed, religion, age, sex, national origin, ancestry,
   marital status, sexual preference, income status, AHCCCS membership, or
   physical or mental handicap of the participants to be served.

9. TRANSITION OF MEMBERS
The Contractor shall comply with the AMPM, and the AHCCCS, Office of Managed
Care Member Transition  for Annual Enrollment Choice, Open Enrollment and Other
Plan Changes Policy standards for member transitions between health plans or
GSAs, enrollment in or discharge from CRS, to or from an ALTCS
Program Contractor, IHS, a PL 93-638 tribal entity, and upon termination or
expiration of a contract. The Contractor shall develop and implement policies
and procedures, which comply with these policies to address transition of:

a. Members with significant medical conditions such as a high-risk pregnancy or
   pregnancy within the last 30 days, the need for organ or tissue
   transplantation, chronic illness resulting in hospitalization or nursing
   facility placement, etc.;
b. Members who are receiving ongoing services such as dialysis, home health,
   chemotherapy and/ or radiation therapy or who are hospitalized at the time of
   transition;
c. Members who have received prior authorization for services such as scheduled
   surgeries, out-of-area specialty services, nursing home admission;
d. Prescriptions, DME and medically necessary transportation ordered for the
   transitioning member by the relinquishing contractor; and
e. Medical records of the transitioning member (the cost, if any, of reproducing
   and forwarding medical records shall be the responsibility of the
   relinquishing AHCCCS contractor).

When relinquishing members, the Contractor is responsible for timely
notification to the receiving contractor regarding pertinent information related
to any special needs of transitioning members. The Contractor, when receiving a
transitioning member with special needs, is responsible for coordinating care
with the relinquishing contractor in order that services not be interrupted, and
for providing the new member with health plan and service information, emergency
numbers and instructions about how to obtain services.

10. SCOPE OF SERVICES
The Contractor shall provide covered services to AHCCCS members in accordance
with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations and
policies, including services listed in this document, listed by
reference in attachments, and AHCCCS policies referenced in this document.
The services are described in detail in AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 2 and the
AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM), all of which are incorporated herein by
reference, except for provisions specific to the Fee-for-Service program, and
may be found in the Bidder's Library. The covered services must be medically
necessary and are briefly described below. Except for behavioral health and
children's preventive dental services, covered services must be provided by, or
coordinated with, a primary care provider. Services must be rendered by
providers that are appropriately licensed or certified, operating within their
scope of practice, and registered as an AHCCCS provider. The Contractor shall
provide the same standard of care for all members regardless of the member's
eligibility category. The Contractor may not arbitrarily deny or reduce the
amount, duration, or scope of a required service solely because of the
diagnosis, type of illness, or condition. The Contractor may place

				-21-
<page>

appropriate limits on a service on the basis of criteria such as medical
necessity; or for utilization control, provided the services furnished can
reasonably be expected to achieve their purpose.

The Contractor shall ensure that its providers are not restricted or inhibited
in any way from communicating freely with members regarding the members' health
care, medical needs and treatment options, even if needed services are not
covered by the Contractor.

Ambulatory Surgery and Anesthesiology: The Contractor shall provide surgical
services for either emergency or scheduled surgeries when provided in an
ambulatory or outpatient setting such as a freestanding surgical center or a
hospital based outpatient surgical setting.

Audiology: The Contractor shall provide audiology services to members under the
age of 21 including the identification and evaluation of hearing loss and
rehabilitation of the hearing loss through medical or surgical means (i. e.
hearing aids). Only the identification and evaluation of hearing loss are
covered for members 21 years of age and older unless the hearing loss is due
to an accident or injury-related emergent condition.

Behavioral Health: The Contractor shall provide behavioral health services as
described in Section D, Paragraph 12, Behavioral Health Services.

Children's Rehabilitative Services (CRS): The program for children with
CRS-covered conditions is administered by the Arizona Department of Health
Services (ADHS) for children who meet CRS eligibility criteria. The Contractor
shall refer children to the CRS program who are potentially eligible for
services related to CRS covered conditions, as specified in R9-22, Article 2
and A.R.S. Title 36, Chapter 2, Article 3. Eligibility criteria and the
referral process are described in the CRS Policy and Procedures Manual
available in  the Bidder's Library.

The Contractor shall monitor referrals to CRS to ensure covered services are
provided in a timely manner to eligible members. Referral to CRS does not
relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for providing medically necessary
services not covered by CRS to CRS enrolled members. The Contractor is also
responsible for initial care of newborn members, until those members become
enrolled in CRS. The Contractor must require the member's Primary Care Provider
(PCP) to coordinate their care with the CRS program.

A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRS. If the member
uses their private insurance network for a CRS covered condition, and the
member is not enrolled with CRS, the Contractor is responsible for all
applicable deductibles and copays.

The Contractor remains ultimately responsible for the provision of all covered
services to its members, except for instances in which the CRS eligible
member refuses to receive CRS covered services through the CRS program. If the
Contractor becomes aware that CRS has failed to provide medically necessary CRS
covered services, the Contractor shall proceed as outlined in the CRS Medically
Necessary Appointment Policy located in the AMPM.

Chiropractic Services: The Contractor shall provide chiropractic services to
members under age 21 when prescribed by the member's PCP and approved by the
Contractor in order to ameliorate the member's medical condition. Medicare
approved chiropractic services shall also be covered, subject to limitations
specified in CFR 410.22, for Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries if prescribed by
the member's PCP and approved by the Contractor.

Dental: The Contractor shall provide all members under the age of 21 with all
medically necessary dental services including emergency dental services, dental
screening and preventive services in accordance with the

				-22-
<page>

AHCCCS periodicity schedule, as well as therapeutic dental services, dentures,
and pre-transplantation dental services. The Contractor shall monitor compliance
with the EPSDT periodicity schedule for dental screening services. The
Contractor is required to meet specific utilization rates for members as
described in Section D, Paragraph 24, Performance Standards. The Contractor
shall ensure that members are notified when dental screenings are due if the
member has not been scheduled for a visit. If a dental screening is not
received by the member, a second notice must be sent. Members under the age of

<page>

The Contractor may not deny payment for treatment obtained under either of the
following circumstances:

1. A member had an emergency medical condition, including cases in which the
   absence of medical attention would not have resulted in the outcomes
   identified in the definition of emergency medical condition CFR 438.114.
2. A representative of the Contractor (an employee or subcontracting provider)
   instructs the member to seek emergency medical services.

Additionally, the Contractor may not:

1. Limit what constitutes an emergency medical condition as defined in CFR

2. Refuse to cover emergency services based on the failure of the provider,
   hospital, or fiscal agent to notify the Contractor of the member's screening
   and treatment within 10 calendar days of presentation for emergency services.
   This notification stipulation is only related to the provision of emergency
   services.

A member who has an emergency medical condition may not be held liable for
payment of subsequent screening and treatment needed to diagnose the specific
condition or stabilize the patient.

The attending emergency physician, or the provider actually treating the member,
is responsible for determining when the member is sufficiently stabilized for

services, it must contract for these services through another health care
delivery system, which allows members freedom of choice in selecting a provider.

The Contractor shall provide services to members enrolled in the Family Planning
Services Extension Program, a program that provides family planning services
only, for a maximum of 24 months, to women whose SOBRA eligibility has
terminated. The Contractor is also responsible for notifying AHCCCSA when a

price of the item. Reasonable repairs or adjustments of purchased equipment are
covered to make the equipment serviceable and/ or when the repair cost is less
than renting or purchasing another unit.

Nursing Facility: The Contractor shall provide services in nursing facilities,
including religious non-medical health care institutions, for members who
require short-term convalescent care not to exceed 90 days per contract year.
In lieu of a nursing facility, the member may be placed in an assisted living

Post-stabilization Care Services Coverage and Payment: Pursuant to 42
CFR 438.114, and 42 CFR 422.113( c), the following conditions apply with respect
to coverage and payment of post-stabilization care services:

The Contractor must cover and pay for post-stabilization care services without
authorization, regardless of whether the provider that furnishes the service
has a contract with the Contractor, for the following situations:

1. Post-stabilization care services that were pre-approved by the Contractor;
   or,
2. Post-stabilization care services were not pre-approved by the Contractor
   because the Contractor did not respond to the treating provider's request for
   pre-approval within one hour after being requested to approve such care or
   could not be contacted for pre-approval.
3. The Contractor representative and the treating physician cannot reach
   agreement concerning the enrollee's care and a contractor physician is not
   available for consultation. In this situation, the Contractor must give the
   treating physician the opportunity to consult with a contractor physician
   and the treating physician may continue with care of the patient until a
   contractor physician is reached or one of the criteria in CFR 422.113(c)(3)
   is met.

Pursuant to CFR 422.113(c)(3), the Contractor's financial responsibility for
post-stabilization care services that have not been pre-approved ends when:

1. A contractor physician with privileges at the treating hospital assumes
   responsibility for the member's care;
2. A contractor physician assumes responsibility for the member's care through
   transfer;
3. A contractor representative and the treating physician reach an agreement
   concerning the member's care; or
4. The member is discharged.

Pregnancy Terminations: AHCCCS covers pregnancy termination when it is the
result of rape or incest, or in circumstances where the member suffers from a
physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life
endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself,
that would, as certified by a physician, place the member in danger of death
unless the pregnancy is terminated. In addition, providers must submit to the
Contractor a Certificate of Medical Necessity for Pregnancy Termination. Prior
authorization is required. If the procedure is performed on an emergency basis,
 documentation, outlined in the AMPM, is required for a member under eighteen
years of age or a member who is considered an incapacitated adult who seeks a
medically necessary pregnancy termination, as defined above. The scope of
medically

				-27-
<page>

necessary pregnancy termination coverage is currently in litigation and is
expected to be broadened. A copy of the Court's final judgment will be placed
in the Bidder's Library.

Prescription Drugs: Medications ordered by a PCP, attending physician or dentist
and dispensed under the direction of a licensed pharmacist are covered subject
to limitations related to prescription supply amounts, contractor formularies
and prior authorization requirements, as well as restrictions for
immunosuppressant drugs addressed in AHCCCS medical policies for
transplantations. Contractors may include over-the-counter medications in their
formulary. An appropriate over-the-counter medication may be prescribed, when it
determined to be a lower-cost alternative to prescription drugs. See Paragraph
75, Pending Legislative/Other Issues for more information regarding the
potential carve out of prescription drug benefits from capitation.

Primary Care Provider (PCP): PCP services are covered when provided by a
physician, physician assistant or nurse practitioner selected by, or assigned
to, the member. The PCP provides primary health care and serves as a gatekeeper

in both inpatient and outpatient settings. For those members who are 21 and
over, occupational and speech therapies are covered in inpatient settings only.

Respiratory Therapy: This therapy is covered in inpatient and outpatient
settings when prescribed by the member's PCP or attending physician, and is
necessary to restore, maintain or improve respiratory functioning.

Transplantation of Organs and Tissue, and Related Immunosuppressant Drugs: These
services are covered within limitations defined in the AMPM for members
diagnosed with specified medical conditions. Such limitations include: whether
the stage of the disease is such that the transplant can affect the outcome; the
member has no other conditions that substantially reduce the potential for
successful transplantation; and whether the member will be able to comply with
necessary and required regimens of treatment. Bone grafts are also covered under
this service. Services include pre-transplant inpatient or outpatient
evaluation; donor search; organ/ tissue harvesting or procurement; preparation
and transplantation services; and convalescent care. In addition, if a member
receives, or has received, a transplant covered by a source other than AHCCCS,
medically necessary non-experimental services are provided, within limitations,
after the discharge from the acute care hospitalization for the transplantation.
AHCCCS has contracted with transplantation providers for the Contractor's use or
the Contractor may select its own transplantation provider.

Transportation: These services include emergency and non-emergency medically
necessary transportation. Emergency transportation, including transportation
initiated by an emergency response system such as 911, may be provided by

The Contractor must implement mechanisms to identify persons with special health
care needs in accordance with the guidelines provided in the AMPM.

The Contractor must implement mechanisms to assess each member identified as
having special health care needs, in order to identify any ongoing special
conditions of the member which require a course of treatment or
regular care monitoring in accordance with the guidelines provided in the AMPM.

For members with special health care needs determined to need a specialized
course of treatment or regular care monitoring, the Contractor must have
procedures in place to allow members to directly access a specialist
(for example through a standing referral or an approved number of visits) as
appropriate for the member's condition and identified needs.

coordination of behavioral health referrals of these members to the RBHA when
determined necessary through the screening process.
The Contractor is responsible for RBHA referral and follow-up collaboration,
as necessary, for other members identified as needing behavioral health
evaluation and treatment. Members may also access the RBHA system for evaluation
by self-referral or be referred by schools, State agencies or other service
providers. The Contractor is responsible for providing transportation to a
member's first RBHA evaluation appointment if a member is unable to provide
his/her own transportation.

Emergency Services: For those members who are not ADHS behavioral health
recipients, the Contractor is responsible for up to three days of inpatient
behavioral health services per emergency episode, not to exceed 12 days per
contract year. A referral to the RBHA for evaluation and identification as an
ADHS behavioral health recipient should be initiated as soon as possible after

provided to ADHS behavioral health recipients in emergency room settings.

Coordination of Care: The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that a medical
record is established by the PCP when behavioral health information is received
from the RBHA or provider about an assigned member even if the PCP has not yet
seen the assigned member. In lieu of actually establishing a medical record,
such information may be kept in an appropriately labeled file but must be
associated with the member's medical record as soon as one is established.
The Contractor shall require the PCP to respond to RBHA/ provider information
requests pertaining to ADHS behavioral health recipient members including, but
not limited to, current diagnosis, medication, pertinent laboratory results,
last PCP visit, and last hospitalization. For prior period coverage, the
Contractor is responsible for payment of all claims for medically necessary
covered behavioral health services to members who are not ADHS behavioral health
recipients.

13. AHCCCS MEDICAL POLICY MANUAL
The AHCCCS Medical Policy Manual (AMPM) is hereby incorporated by reference into
this contract. The Contractor is responsible for complying with the requirements
set forth within. The AMPM, with search capability and linkages to AHCCCS rules,
statutes and other resources, is available to all interested parties
through the AHCCCS Home Page on the Internet (www. ahcccs. state. az. us). Upon
adoption by AHCCCSA, AMPM updates will be available through the Internet at the
beginning of each month. The Contractor shall be responsible for maintaining a
copy current with these updates.

14. MEDICAID IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS (MIPS)
Pursuant to an Intergovernmental Agreement with the Department of Education, and
a contract with a Third Party Administrator, AHCCCSA reimburses participating
school districts for specifically identified Medicaid services when provided to
Medicaid eligible children who are included under the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The Medicaid services must be identified in
the member's Individual Education Plan (IEP) as medically necessary for the
child to obtain a public school education.

MIPS services are provided in a school setting or other approved setting
specifically to allow children to receive a public school education. They do not
replace medically necessary services provided outside the school setting or
other MIPS approved alternative setting. Currently, services include therapies
(OT, PT and speech/ language); behavioral health evaluation and counseling;
nursing and attendant care; and specialized transportation. The Contractor's
evaluations and determinations, about whether services are medically necessary,
should be made independent of the fact that the child is receiving MIPS
services.

Contractors and their providers must coordinate with schools and school
districts that provide MIPS services to the Contractor's enrolled members.
Services should not be duplicative. Contractor case managers, working
with special needs children, should coordinate with school or school
district case managers/ special education teachers, working with these members.
Transfer of member medical information and progress toward
treatment goals between the Contractor and the member's school or school
district is required and should be used to enhance the services provided to
members.

15. PEDIATRIC IMMUNIZATIONS AND THE VACCINE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM
Through the Vaccine for Children Program, the Federal and State governments
purchase, and make available to providers free of charge, vaccines for AHCCCS
children under age 19. The Contractor shall not utilize AHCCCS funding to
purchase vaccines for members under the age of 19. If vaccines are not available
through the VFC Program, the Contractor shall contact the AHCCCSA Office of
Medical Management, Clinical Quality Management Unit. Any provider, licensed by
the State to administer immunizations, may register with ADHS as a
"VFC provider" and receive free vaccines. The Contractor shall comply with all
VFC requirements and monitor its providers to ensure that, if providing
immunizations to AHCCCS members under the age of 19, the providers are
registered with ADHS/ VFC.

Arizona State law requires the reporting of all immunizations given to children
under the age of 19. Immunizations must be reported at least monthly to the
ADHS. Reported immunizations are held in a central database known as ASIIS
(Arizona State Immunization Information System), which can be accessed by
providers to obtain complete, accurate immunization records. Software is
available from ADHS to assist providers in meeting this reporting requirement.
Contractors are encouraged to educate their provider network about these
reporting requirements and the use of this resource.

23. QUALITY MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT (QM/UM)
Quality Management (QM): The Contractor shall provide quality medical care to
members, regardless of payer source or eligibility category. The Contractor
shall execute processes to assess, plan, implement and evaluate quality
management and improvement activities, as specified in the AMPM, that include
at least the following:

  Conducting Quality Improvement Projects (QIPs);
  QM monitoring and evaluation activities;
  Credentialing and recredentialing processes;
  Investigation, analysis, tracking and trending of quality of care issues,
  abuse and/ or complaints; and

The Contractor shall submit, within timelines specified in Attachment F, a
written QM plan that addresses its strategies for quality improvement and
conducting the quality management activities described in this section.
The Contractor shall conduct quality improvement projects as required by the
AMPM.

The Contractor may combine its plan for quality improvement and quality
management activities with the plan that addresses utilization management as
described below.

				-36-

  Consistent application of review criteria.

The Contractor shall maintain a written UM plan that addresses its plan for
monitoring UM activities described in this section. The plan must be submitted
for review by AHCCCS Office of Medical Management (OMM) within timelines
specified in Attachment F.

24. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
All Performance Standards described below apply to all member populations.

Contractors must meet AHCCCS stated Minimum Performance Standards. However, it
is equally important that Contractors continually improve their performance
indicator outcomes from year to year. Contractors shall strive to meet the
ultimate standard, or benchmark, established by AHCCCS.

Any statistically significant drop in the Contractor's performance level for any
indicator must be explained by the Contractor in its annual quality management
program evaluation. If a Contractor has a significant drop in any indicator
without a justifiable explanation, it will be required to submit a corrective
action plan and may be subject to sanctions.

AHCCCS has established three levels of performance:

Minimum Performance Standard - A Minimum Performance Standard is the minimal
expected level of performance by the Contractor. If a Contractor does not
achieve this standard, or any indicator declines to a level below the AHCCCS
Minimum Performance, the Contractor will be required to submit a corrective
action plan and may be subject to sanctions.

Goal - A Goal is a reachable standard for a given performance indicator for the
Contract Year. If the Contractor has already met or exceeded the AHCCCS
Minimum Performance Standard for any indicator, the Contractor must strive to
meet the established Goal for the indicator( s).

Benchmark - A Benchmark is the ultimate standard to be achieved. Contractors
that have already achieved or exceeded the Goal for any performance indicator
must strive to meet the Benchmark for the indicator( s). Contractors that have
achieved the Benchmark are expected to maintain this level of performance for
future years.

A Contractor that has not shown demonstrable and sustained improvement toward
meeting AHCCCS Performance Standards shall develop a corrective action plan.
The corrective action plan must be received by AHCCCS, Office of Medical
Management within 30 days of receipt of notification from AHCCCS. This plan
must be approved by AHCCCS prior to implementation. AHCCCS may conduct one or
more follow-up onsite

				-37-
<page>

reviews to verify compliance with a corrective action plan. Failure to achieve
adequate improvement may result in sanction imposed by AHCCCS.

Performance Indicators: The Contractor shall comply with AHCCCS quality
management requirements to improve performance for all AHCCCS established
performance indicators. Complete descriptions of these indicators can be found
in the Technical Specifications section of the most recently published Health
Plan Performance Standards Results and Analysis documents for perinatal,
pediatric and adult/ adolescent services. The indicators for postpartum visits
and low birth weight have been eliminated as contractual performance
standards. The Contractor shall continue to monitor rates for postpartum visits
and low birth weights and implement interventions as necessary to improve or
sustain these rates. These activities will be monitored by AHCCCSA during the
Operational and Financial Review.

CMS has been working in partnership with states in developing core performance
measures for Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The current AHCCCS established
performance indicators may be subject to change when these core measures are
finalized and implemented.

In addition, AHCCCS has established standards for the following indicators:

EPSDT Participation: The Contractor shall take affirmative steps to increase
member participation in the EPSDT program. The participation rate is the number
of children younger than 21 years receiving at least one medical screen during
the contract year, compared to the number of children expected to receive at
least one medical screen. The number of children expected to receive at least
one medical screen is based on the AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule and the
average period of eligibility.

Pediatric immunizations: The Contractor shall ensure members under age 21
receive age-appropriate immunizations as specified in the AMPM.

The Contractor shall participate in immunization audits, at intervals specified
by AHCCCSA, based on random sampling to assess and verify the immunization
status of two-year-old members. AHCCCS will provide the Contractor the selected
sample, specifications for conducting the audit, the AHCCCSA reporting
requirements, and technical assistance. The Contractor shall identify each
child's PCP, conduct the assessment, and report to AHCCCSA, in the required
format, all immunization data for the two-year-old children sampled. If medical
records are missing for more than 5 percent of the sample group, the Contractor
is subject to sanctions by AHCCCSA. An External Quality Review Organization
(EQRO) may conduct a study to validate the Contractor's reported rates.

25. GRIEVANCE AND REQUEST FOR HEARING PROCESS AND STANDARDS
The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance process for enrollees and
providers, which defines their rights regarding disputed matters with the
Contractor. The Contractor shall provide the appropriate personnel
to establish, implement and maintain the necessary functions related to the
grievance systems process. Refer to Attachment H( 1) and H( 2) for Enrollee
Grievance System Standards and Policy and Provider Grievance System Standards
and Policy, respectively.

The grievance process shall be in accordance with applicable Federal and State
laws, regulations and policies, including, but not limited to 42 CFR Part 438
Subpart F. The Contractor shall ensure compliance with
Attachment H. Contractor shall also ensure that it timely provides written
information to both enrollees and providers, which clearly explains the
grievance system requirements. Information to enrollees must meet
cultural competency and limited English proficiency requirements as specified in
the AHCCCS Cultural Competency Policy and Section D, Paragraph 18, Member
Information.

The Contractor shall be responsible to provide the necessary professional,
paraprofessional and clerical services for the representation of the Contractor
in all issues relating to the grievance system and any other matters arising
under this contract which rise to the level of administrative hearing or a
judicial proceeding.

26. QUARTERLY GRIEVANCE REPORT
The Contractor shall submit a Quarterly Grievance Report to AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, using the Quarterly Grievance System Report Format. The
Quarterly Grievance System Report must be received by the AHCCCSA, Office of
Legal Assistance, no later than 45 days from the end of the quarter.

27. NETWORK DEVELOPMENT
The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is sufficient
to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members. It shall ensure covered
services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in
terms of location and hours of operation. There shall be sufficient personnel
for the provision of covered services, including emergency medical care on
a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis. The proposed network shall be

				-39-
<page>

sufficient to provide covered services within designated time and distance
limits. For Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that
95% of its members residing within the boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix
and Tucson do not have to travel more than 5 miles to see a PCP, dentist or
pharmacy. Ninety-five percent of its members residing outside the boundary area
must not have to travel more than 10 miles to see such providers. PCPs and
specialists who provide inpatient services to the Contractor's members shall
have admitting and treatment privileges in a minimum of one general acute care
hospital within the Contractor's service area. Hospitalists may satisfy this
requirement. Contractors in Maricopa and/ or Pima counties must have at least
one hospital contract in each of the service districts specified in Attachment
B.

Contractors must provide a comprehensive provider network that ensures its
membership has access at least equal to, or better than, community norms.
Services shall be as accessible to AHCCCS members in terms of timeliness,
amount, duration and scope as those services are to non-AHCCCS persons within
the same service area. The Contractor is expected to consider the full spectrum
of care when developing its network. The Contractor must also consider
communities whose residents typically receive care in neighboring states. If
the Contractor is unable to provide those services locally, it must so
demonstrate to AHCCCSA and shall provide reasonable alternatives for members
to access care. These alternatives must be approved by AHCCCSA. If the
Contractor's network is unable to provide medically necessary services required
under contract, the Contractor must adequately and timely cover these
services through an out of network provider until a network provider is
contracted. The Contractor and out of network provider must coordinate with
respect to authorization and payment issues in these circumstances.

The Contractor is also encouraged to develop non-financial incentive programs
to increase participation in its provider network.

The Contractor shall not discriminate with respect to participation in the
AHCCCS program, reimbursement or indemnification against any provider based
solely on the provider's type of licensure or certification. In addition,
the Contractor must not discriminate against particular providers that service
high-risk populations or specialize in conditions that require costly treatment.
provision, however, does not prohibit the Contractor from limiting provider
participation to the extent necessary to meet the needs of the Contractor's
members. This provision also does not interfere with measures established by the
Contractor to control costs consistent with its responsibilities under this
contract. If a Contractor declines to include individual or groups of providers
in its network, it must give the affected providers written notice of the reason
for its decision. The Contractor may not include providers excluded from
participation in Federal health care programs, under either section 1128 or
section 1128A of the Social Security Act.

See Attachment B, Minimum Network Requirements, for details on network
requirements by Geographic Service Area.

Provider Network Development and Management Plan: The Contractor shall develop
and maintain a provider network development and management plan, which ensures
that the provision of covered services will occur as stated above. This plan
shall be updated annually and submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care,
45 days from the start of each contract year. The plan shall identify the
current status of the Contractor's network, and project future needs based
upon, at a minimum, membership growth; the number and types (in terms of
training, experience and specialization) of providers that exist in the
Contractor's service area; the expected utilization of services, given the
characteristics of its population and its health care needs; the numbers of
providers not accepting new Medicaid patients; and access of its membership
to specialty services as compared to the general population of the community.
The plan, at a minimum, shall also include the following:

a. current network gaps;
b. immediate short-term interventions when a gap occurs, including expedited
or temporary credentialing;
c. interventions to fill network gaps and barriers to those interventions;

				-40-
<page>

d. outcome measures/ evaluation of interventions;
e. ongoing activities for network development;
f. coordination between internal departments;
g. coordination with outside organizations and
h. specialty populations.

28. PROVIDER AFFILIATION TRANSMISSION
The Contractor shall submit information quarterly regarding its provider
network. This information shall be submitted in the format described in the
Provider Affiliation Transmission User Manual on October 15, January 15, April
15, and July 15 of each contract year. The manual may be found in the Bidder's
Library. If the provider affiliation transmission is not timely, accurate and
complete, the Contractor may be required to submit a corrective action plan and
may be subject to sanction.

29. NETWORK MANAGEMENT
The Contractor shall have policies and procedures in place that pertain to all
service specifications described in the AMPM. In addition, the Contractor shall
have policies on how the Contractor will:

a. Communicate with the network regarding contractual and/ or program changes
   and requirements;
b. Monitor network compliance with policies and rules of AHCCCSA and the
   Contractor, including compliance with all policies and procedures related to
   the grievance process and ensuring the member's care is not compromised
   during the grievance process;
c. Evaluate the quality of services delivered by the network;
d. Provide or arrange for medically necessary covered services should the
   network become temporarily insufficient within the contracted service area;
e. Monitor the adequacy, accessibility and availability of its provider network
   to meet the needs of its members, including the provision of care to members
   with limited proficiency in English; and
f. Process expedited and temporary credentials.

Contractor policies shall be subject to approval by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed
Care, and shall be monitored through operational audits.

All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in
advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. A material change is defined as one
which affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability
to meet the performance and network standards as described in this contract.
AHCCCSA will assess proposed changes in the Contractor's provider network for
potential impact on members' health care and provide a written response to the
Contractor. For emergency situations, AHCCCSA will expedite the approval
process.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within one working
day of any unexpected changes that would impair its provider network. This
notification shall include (1) information about how the change will affect the
delivery of covered services, and (2) the Contractor's plans for maintaining
the quality of member care, if the provider network change is likely to affect
the delivery of covered services.

30. PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS
The Contractor shall include in its provider network a sufficient number of PCPs
to meet the requirements of this contract. Health care providers designated by
the Contractor as PCPs shall be licensed in Arizona as

				-41-
<page>

allopathic or osteopathic physicians who generally specialize in family
practice, internal medicine, obstetrics, gynecology, or pediatrics; certified
nurse practitioners or certified nurse midwifes; or physician's assistants.

The Contractor shall assess the PCP's ability to meet AHCCCS appointment
availability and other standards when determining the appropriate number of its
members to be assigned to a PCP. The Contractor should also consider the PCP's
total panel size (i. e. AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS patients) when making this
determination. AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of a PCP's panel
of patients. AHCCCSA shall inform the Contractor when a PCP has a panel of more
than 1,800 AHCCCS members (assigned by a single Contractor or multiple
Contractors), to assist in the assessment of the size of their panel. This
information will be provided on a quarterly basis. The Contractor will adjust
the size of a PCP's panel, as needed, for the PCP to meet AHCCCS standards.

The Contractor shall have a system in place to monitor and ensure that each
member is assigned to an individual PCP and that the Contractor's data
regarding PCP assignments is current. The Contractor is encouraged to assign
members with complex medical conditions, who are age 12 and younger, to board
certified pediatricians. PCP's, with assigned members diagnosed with AIDS or
as HIV positive, shall meet criteria and standards set forth in the AMPM.

To the extent required by this contract, the Contractor shall offer members
freedom of choice within its network in selecting a PCP. The Contractor may
restrict this choice when a member has shown an inability to
form a relationship with a PCP, as evidenced by frequent changes, or when there
is a medically necessary reason. When a new member has been assigned to the
Contractor, the Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment
and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of the Contractor's receipt of
notification of assignment by AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall include with the
enrollment notification a list of all the Contractor's available PCPs, the
process for changing the PCP assignment, should the member desire to do so,
as well as the information required in the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care Member
Information Policy. The Contractor shall confirm any PCP change in writing to
the member. Members may make both their initial PCP selection and any
subsequent PCP changes either verbally or in writing.

At a minimum, the Contractor shall hold the PCP responsible for the following
gatekeeping activities:

a. Supervision, coordination and provision of care to each assigned member;
b. Initiation of referrals for medically necessary specialty care;
c. Maintaining continuity of care for each assigned member; and
d. Maintaining the member's medical record, including documentation of all
   services provided to the member by the PCP, as well as any specialty or
   referral services.

The Contractor shall establish and implement policies and procedures to monitor
PCP gatekeeping activities and to ensure that PCPs are adequately notified of,
and receive documentation regarding, specialty and referral services provided
to assigned members by specialty physicians, and other health care
professionals. Contractor policies and procedures shall be subject to approval
by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, and shall be monitored through operational
audits.

31. MATERNITY CARE PROVIDER STANDARDS
The Contractor shall ensure that a maternity care provider is designated for
each pregnant member for the duration of her pregnancy and postpartum care and
that maternity services are provided in accordance with the AMPM. The
Contractor may include in its provider network the following maternity care
providers:

a. Arizona licensed allopathic and/ or osteopathic physicians who are general
practitioners or specialize in family practice or obstetrics

				-42-
<page>

b. Physician Assistants
c. Nurse Practitioners
d. Certified Nurse Midwives

Pregnant members may choose, or be assigned, a PCP who provides obstetrical
care. Such assignment shall be consistent with the freedom of choice
requirements for selecting health care professionals while ensuring that
the continuity of care is not compromised. Members who choose to receive
maternity services from a licensed midwife shall also be assigned to a PCP for
medical care, as primary care is not within the scope of practice for
licensed midwives.

All physicians and certified nurse midwives who perform deliveries shall have OB
hospital privileges or a documented hospital coverage agreement for those
practitioners performing deliveries in alternate settings. Licensed midwives
perform deliveries only in the member's home. Labor and delivery services may
also be provided in the member's home by physicians, certified nurse
practitioners and certified nurse midwives who include such services within
their practice.

32. REFERRAL PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS
The Contractor shall have adequate written procedures regarding referrals to
specialists, to include, at a minimum, the following:

a. Use of referral forms clearly identifying the Contractor
b. A system for resolving disputes regarding the referrals
c. PCP referral shall be required for specialty physician services, except that
   women shall have direct access to in-network GYN providers, including
   physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners within the scope of
   their practice, without a referral for preventive and routine services. In
   addition, for members with special health care needs determined to need a
   specialized course of treatment or regular care monitoring, the Contractor
   must have a mechanism in place to allow such members to directly access a
   specialist (for example through a standing referral or an approved number of
   visits) as appropriate for the member's condition and identified needs. Any
   waiver of this requirement by the Contractor must be approved in advance by
   AHCCCSA.
d. Specialty physicians shall not begin a course of treatment for a medical
   condition other than that for which the member was referred, unless approved
   by the member's PCP.
e. A process in place that ensures the member's PCP receives all specialist and
   consulting reports and a process to ensure PCP follow-up of all referrals
   including EPSDT referrals for behavioral health services
f. A referral plan for any member who is about to lose eligibility and who
   requests information on low-cost or no-cost health care services
g. Referral to Medicare HMO including payment of copayments
h. Allow for a second opinion from a qualified health care professional within
   the network, or if one is not available in network, arrange for the member
   to obtain one outside the network, at no cost to the member.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable physician referral requirements
and conditions defined in Sections 1903( s) and 1877 of the Social Security Act.
Upon finalization of the regulations, the Contractor shall comply with all
applicable physician referral requirements and conditions defined in 42 CFR
Part 411,  Part 424, Part 435 and Part 455. Sections 1903( s) and 1877 of the
Act prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services
to health care entities with which the physician or a member of the
physician's family has a financial relationship. Designated health services
include:

a. Clinical laboratory services
b. Physical therapy services
c. Occupational therapy services

				-43-

d. Radiology services
e. Radiation therapy services and supplies
f. Durable medical equipment and supplies
g. Parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies
h. Prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies
i. Home health services
j. Outpatient prescription drugs
k. Inpatient and outpatient hospital services

33. APPOINTMENT STANDARDS
For purposes of this section, "urgent" is defined as an acute, but not
necessarily life-threatening disorder,
which, if not attended to, could endanger the patient's health. The
Contractor shall have procedures in place that ensure the following standards
are met:

a. Emergency PCP appointments-same day of request
b. Urgent care PCP appointments-within 2 days of request
c. Routine care PCP appointments-within 21 days of request

For specialty referrals, the Contractor shall be able to provide:

a. Emergency appointments -within 24 hours of referral
b. Urgent care appointments -within 3 days of referral
c. Routine care appointments -within 45 days of referral

For dental appointments, the Contractor shall be able to provide:

b. Second trimester -within 7 days of request
c. Third trimester -within 3 days of request
d. High risk pregnancies -within 3 days of identification of high risk by the
Contractor or maternity care provider, or immediately if an emergency exists

If a member needs non-emergent medically necessary transportation, the
Contractor shall require its transportation provider to schedule the
transportation so that the member arrives on time for the appointment,
but no sooner than one hour before the appointment; does not have to wait more
than one hour after making the call to be picked up; nor have to wait for
more than one hour after conclusion of the appointment for transportation home.

The Contractor shall actively monitor the adequacy of its appointment processes
and reduce the unnecessary use of alternative methods such as emergency room
visits. The Contractor shall actively monitor and ensure that a member's
waiting time for a scheduled appointment at the PCP's or specialist's office
is no more than 45 minutes, except when the provider is unavailable due to an
emergency.

				-44-
<page>

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures about educating its
provider network regarding appointment time requirements. The Contractor must
assign a specific staff member or unit within its organization to monitor
compliance with appointment standards. The Contractor must develop a corrective
action plan when appointment standards are not met; if appropriate, the
corrective action plan should be developed in conjunction with the provider.
Appointment standards shall be included in the Provider Manual.
The Contractor is encouraged to include the standards in the provider
subcontract.

34. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC)
The Contractor is encouraged to use FQHCs in Arizona to provide covered services
and must comply with the Federal mandates. Section 4712( b)( 2) of the
Balanced Budget Act requires that "rates of payment between FQHCs/ RHCs and
MCOs shall not be less than the amount of payment for a similar set of services
with a non-FQHC/RHC." The intention of this provision is to ensure that
contractors negotiate rates of payment with FQHCs that are comparable to the
rates paid to providers that provide similar services.

Contractors are required to submit member information for Title XIX members for
each FQHC on a quarterly basis to the AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care. AHCCCSA
will perform periodic audits of the member information submitted. Contractors
should refer to the AHCCCS Office of Managed Care's policy on FQHC reimbursement
for further guidance. The following FQHCs are currently recognized by CMS:

	Canyonlands Community Health Care
	Chiricahua Community Health Centers, Inc.
	Clinica Adelante, Inc.
	Community Health Center of West Yavapai
	Desert Senita Community Health Center
	El Rio Health Center

	Sunset Community Health Center (formerly Valley Health Center, Inc.)
	United Community Health Center, Inc.

35. PROVIDER MANUAL
The Contractor shall develop, distribute and maintain a provider manual. The
Contractor shall ensure that each contracted provider is issued a copy of the
provider manual and is encouraged to distribute a provider manual to any
individual or group that submits claim and encounter data. The Contractor
remains liable for ensuring that all providers, whether contracted or not,
meet the applicable AHCCCS requirements such as covered services, billing,
etc. At a minimum, the Contractor's provider manual must contain information on
the following:

a. Introduction to the Contractor which explains the Contractor's organization
   and administrative structure
b. Provider responsibility and the Contractor's expectation of the provider

   interpretation services to assist members who speak a language other the
   English or who use sign language.
z. Peer review and appeal process.

36. PROVIDER REGISTRATION
The Contractor shall ensure that all of its subcontractors register with AHCCCSA
as an approved service provider and receive an AHCCCS Provider ID Number.
A Provider Participation Agreement must be signed by each provider who does not
already have a current AHCCCS ID number. The original shall be forwarded to
AHCCCSA. This provider registration process must be completed in order for the
Contractor to report services a subcontractor renders to enrolled members and
for the Contractor to be paid reinsurance.

37. SUBCONTRACTS
The Contractor shall be legally responsible for contract performance whether or
not subcontracts are used. No subcontract shall operate to terminate the legal
responsibility of the Contractor to assure that all activities carried out by
the subcontractor conform to the provisions of this contract. Subject to such
conditions, any function required to be provided by the Contractor pursuant to
this contract may be subcontracted to a qualified person or organization. All
such subcontracts must be in writing. See the AHCCCS Claims Processing by
Subcontracted Providers Policy in the Bidder's Library.

				-46-
<page>

All subcontracts entered into by the Contractor are subject to prior review and
approval by AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care, and shall incorporate by reference

d. Model subcontracts
e. Capitated or other risk subcontracts requiring claims processing by the
   subcontractor
f. Hospitals
g. Requests for Proposal issued by the Contractor for the procurement of
   medical services.

The Contractor shall maintain a fully executed original of all subcontracts,
which shall be accessible to AHCCCSA within two working days of request by
AHCCCSA. A subcontract is voidable and subject to immediate cancellation by
AHCCCSA in the event any subcontract pertinent to "a" through "g" above is
implemented without the prior written approval of AHCCCSA. All subcontracts
shall comply with the applicable provisions of Federal and State laws,
regulations and policies.

The Contractor shall not include covenant-not-to-compete requirements in its
provider agreements. Specifically, the Contractor shall not contract with a
provider and require that the provider not provide services for any other
AHCCCS Contractor.

The Contractor must enter into a written agreement with any provider
(including out-of-state providers) the Contractor reasonably anticipates will be
providing services on its behalf more than 25 times during the contract year.
Exceptions to this requirement include the following:

a. If a provider who provides services more than 25 times during the contract
   year refuses to enter into a written agreement with the Contractor, the
   Contractor shall submit documentation of such refusal to AHCCCS, Office of
   Managed Care within seven days of its final attempt to gain such agreement.
b. If a provider performs emergency services such as an emergency room physician
   or an ambulance company, a written agreement is not required.
c. Individual providers as detailed in the AMPM.
d. Hospitals, as discussed in Section D, Paragraph 40, Hospital Subcontracting
   and Reimbursement.

These and any other exceptions to this requirement must be approved by AHCCCS,
Office of Managed Care. Each subcontract must contain verbatim all the
provisions of Attachment A, Minimum Subcontract Provisions. In
addition, each subcontract must contain the following:

a. Full disclosure of the method and amount of compensation or other
   consideration to be received by the subcontractor.
b. Identification of the name and address of the subcontractor.

   of extension, termination and re-negotiation.
f. The specific duties of the subcontractor relating to coordination of benefits
   and determination of third-party liability.
g. A provision that the subcontractor agrees to identify Medicare and other
   third-party liability coverage and to seek such Medicare or third party
   liability payment before submitting claims to the Contractor.
h. A description of the subcontractor's patient, medical and cost record
   keeping system.

				-47-
<page>

i. Specification that the subcontractor shall cooperate with quality
   management/ quality improvement programs, and comply with the utilization
   management and review procedures specified in the AMPM.
j. A provision stating that a merger, reorganization or change in ownership of
   a subcontractor that is related to or affiliated with the Contractor shall
   require a contract amendment and prior approval of AHCCCSA.
k. Procedures for enrollment or re-enrollment of the covered population
   (may also refer to the Provider Manual).
l. A provision that the subcontractor shall be fully responsible for all tax
   obligations, Worker's Compensation Insurance, and all other applicable
   insurance coverage obligations which arise under this subcontract, for itself
   and its employees, and that AHCCCSA shall have no responsibility or
   liability for any such taxes or insurance coverage.

   from the Contractor or AHCCCSA for services provided to eligible and/or
   enrolled members.

38. CLAIMS PAYMENT SYSTEM
The Contractor shall develop and maintain a claims payment system capable of
processing, cost avoiding and paying claims in accordance with ARS 36-2904( H)
and (J), AHCCCS Rules R9-22-705, and R9-22-709, a copy of which may be found in
the Bidder's Library. In the absence of a subcontract provision to the contrary,
claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from the date of service or the
effective date of eligibility posting, whichever is later. Remittance advices
accompanying the Contractor's payments to providers must contain, at a
minimum, adequate descriptions of all denials and adjustments, the reasons for
such denials and adjustments, the amount billed, the amount paid, and grievance
and request for hearing rights. The Contractor's claims payment system, as well
as its prior authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize the
likelihood of having to recoup already-paid claims. Any recoupment in excess of
$50,000 per provider within a contract year must be approved in advance by
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

In accordance with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, unless a subcontract
specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall ensure that 90% of all clean claims
are paid within 30 days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are paid
within 90 days of receipt of the clean claim. Additionally, unless a
subcontract specifies otherwise, the Contractor shall not require providers
to initially submit claims earlier than 6 months after date of service or to
submit clean claims earlier than 12 months after date of service for which
payment is claimed. The receipt date of the claim is the date stamp on the
claim. The paid date of the claim is the date on the check or other form of
payment.

39. SPECIALTY CONTRACTS
AHCCCSA may at any time negotiate or contract on behalf of the Contractor and
AHCCCSA for specialized hospital and medical services. AHCCCSA will consider
existing Contractor resources in the development and execution of specialty
contracts. AHCCCSA may require the Contractor to modify its delivery network to
accommodate the provisions of specialty contracts. Specialty contracts shall
take precedence over, and supersede, existing and future subcontracts for
services that are subject to specialty contracts. AHCCCSA may consider
waiving this requirement in particular situations if such action is determined
to be in the best interest of the State; however, in no case shall reimbursement
exceed that payable under the relevant AHCCCSA specialty contract.

During the term of specialty contracts, AHCCCSA may act as an intermediary
between the Contractor and specialty contractors to enhance the cost
effectiveness of service delivery. AHCCCSA reserves the right to make
direct payments to specialty contractors on behalf of the Contractor.
Adjudication of claims related to such payments provided under specialty
contracts shall remain the responsibility of the Contractor. AHCCCSA may
provide technical assistance prior to the implementation of any specialty
contracts.

				-48-
<page>

Currently, AHCCCSA only has specialty contracts for transplant services. AHCCCSA
shall provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Contractor prior to
the implementation of any specialty contract.

40. HOSPITAL SUBCONTRACTING AND REIMBURSEMENT
Maricopa and Pima counties only: Legislation authorizes the Hospital
Reimbursement Pilot Program (Pilot), which is effective from October 1, 2001,
through September 30, 2003. Legislation to extend the Pilot may be introduced
for CYE '04. The Pilot, as defined by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-718, requires hospital
subcontracts to be negotiated between health plans in Maricopa and Pima counties
and hospitals to establish reimbursement levels, terms and conditions.
Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor and hospitals to cover
operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims submission and payment,
payment of discounts or penalties and legal resolution which may, as an option,
include establishing arbitration procedures. These negotiated subcontracts
shall remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCSA to ensure availability of quality
services within specific service districts, equity of related party interests
and reasonableness of rates. The general provisions of this program
encompass acute care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that
result in an admission. The Contractor shall submit all hospital subcontracts
and any amendments to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care. For non-emergency
patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that at least 65% of its members use
contracted hospitals. AHCCCSA reserves the right to subsequently adjust the 65%
standard. Further, if in AHCCCSA's judgment the number of emergency days at a
particular non-contracted hospital becomes significant, AHCCCSA may require a
subcontract at that hospital.

All counties EXCEPT Maricopa and Pima: The Contractor shall reimburse hospitals
for member care in accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. The Contractor is
encouraged to obtain subcontracts with hospitals in all GSA's and must submit
copies of these subcontracts, including amendments, to AHCCCSA, Office of
Managed Care, at least seven days prior to the effective dates thereof.

Out-of-State Hospitals: The Contractor shall reimburse out-of-state hospitals in
accordance with AHCCCS Rule R9-22-705. Contractors serving border communities
(excluding Mexico) are strongly encouraged to establish contractual agreements
with those out-of-state hospitals that are identified by GSA in Attachment B.

Hospital Recoupments: The Contractor may conduct prepayment and post-payment
medical reviews of all hospital claims including outlier claims. Erroneously
paid claims are subject to recoupment. If the Contractor fails to identify lack
of medical necessity through concurrent review and/ or prepayment medical
review, lack of medical necessity identified during post-payment medical review
shall not constitute a basis for recoupment by the Contractor. This prohibition
does not apply to recoupments that are a result of an AHCCCS reinsurance audit.
See also Section D, Paragraph 38, Claims Payment System. For a more complete
description of the guidelines for hospital reimbursement, please consult the
Bidder's Library for applicable statutes and rules.

41. NURSING FACILITY REIMBURSEMENT
The Contractor shall not deny nursing facility services if the nursing facility
is unable to obtain prior authorization in situations where acute care
eligibility and ALTCS eligibility overlap and the member is enrolled with an
AHCCCS acute care contractor. In such situations, the Contractor shall impose
reasonable authorization requirements. The Contractor's payment responsibility,
described above, applies only in situations where the nursing facility has not
been notified in advance of the member's enrollment with an AHCCCS acute care
contractor. When ALTCS eligibility overlaps AHCCCS acute care enrollment, the
acute care enrollment takes precedence. Although the member could be ALTCS
eligible for this time period, there is no ALTCS enrollment that occurs on the
same days as AHCCCS acute enrollment.

				-49-
<page>

The Contractor shall provide medically necessary nursing facility services for
any member who has a pending ALTCS application, who is currently residing in
a nursing facility and is eligible for services provided under
this contract. If the member becomes ALTCS eligible and is enrolled with an
ALTCS Program Contractor before the end of the maximum 90 days per contract
year of nursing facility coverage, the Contractor is only
responsible for nursing facility coverage during the time the member is enrolled
with the Contractor. Nursing facility services, covered by a third party insurer
(including Medicare) while the member is enrolled with the Contractor, shall be
applied to the 90 day per contract year limitation.

The Contractor shall notify the Assistant Director of the Division of Member
Services in writing, when a member has been residing in a nursing facility for
75 days. This will allow AHCCCSA time to follow-up on the status of the ALTCS
application process and to prepare for potential fee-for-service coverage if the
stay goes beyond the 90-day per contract year maximum.

42. PHYSICIAN INCENTIVES
The Contractor must comply with all applicable physician incentive requirements
and conditions defined in 42 CFR 417.479. These regulations prohibit physician
incentive plans that directly or indirectly make payments to a doctor or a
group as an inducement to limit or refuse medically necessary services to a
member. The Contractor is required to disclose all physician incentive
agreements to AHCCCSA and to AHCCCS members who request them.

The Contractor shall not enter into contractual arrangements that place
providers at significant financial risk as defined in CFR 417.479 unless
specifically approved in advance by the AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care.
In order to obtain approval, the following must be submitted to the AHCCCSA
Office of Managed Care 45 days prior to the implementation of the contract:

1. A complete copy of the contract
2. A plan for the member satisfaction survey
3. Details of the stop-loss protection provided
4. A summary of the compensation arrangement that meets the substantial
   financial risk definition.

The Contractor shall disclose to AHCCCSA the information on physician incentive
plans listed in 42 CFR 417.479( h)( 1) through 417.479( I) upon contract
renewal, prior to initiation of a new contract, or upon request from AHCCCSA
or CMS. Please refer to the Physician Incentive Plan Disclosure by Contractors
Policy in the Bidder's Library for details on providing required disclosures.

The Contractor shall also provide for compliance with physician incentive plan
requirements as set forth in 42 CFR 422. These regulations apply to contract
arrangements with subcontracted entities that provide utilization management
services.

43. MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTORS
All proposed management services subcontracts and/ or corporate cost allocation
plans must be approved in advance by AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, as
described in Section D, Paragraph 37, Subcontracts. Cost allocation plans must
be submitted with the proposed management fee agreement. AHCCCSA reserves the
right to perform a thorough review of actual management fees charged and/or
corporate allocations made. If the fees or allocations actually paid out are
determined to be unjustified or excessive, amounts may be subject to repayment
to the Contractor. The Contractor may be placed on monthly financial reporting,
and/ or financial sanctions may be imposed.

				-50-
<page>

44. MANAGEMENT SERVICES SUBCONTRACTOR AUDITS
All management services subcontractors that have oversight responsibilities for
the Contractor's program operations (such as third-party administrators) are
required to have an annual financial audit. A copy of this audit shall be
submitted to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, within 120 days of the
subcontractor's fiscal year end. If services billed by a consultant or
actuary are less than $50,000 annually, AHCCCSA will waive the requirement
for an audit of that consultant or actuary.

45. MINIMUM CAPITALIZATION REQUIREMENTS
In order to be considered for a contract award, the Offeror must meet a minimum
capitalization requirement for each GSA bid. The capitalization requirement
for both new and continuing offerors must be met within 30 days after contract
award.

Minimum capitalization requirements by GSA are as follows:

</TABLE>

*Yavapai's minimum capitalization requirement for both new and existing offerors
is limited to $150 times the estimated number of members.

New Offerors: To be considered for a contract award in a given GSA or group of
GSA's, a new offeror must meet the minimum capitalization requirements listed
above. The capitalization requirement is subject to a $10,000,000 ceiling
regardless of the number of GSA's awarded. This requirement is in addition to
the Performance Bond requirements defined in Paragraphs 46 and 47 below and must
be met with cash with no encumbrances, such as a loan subject to repayment. The
capitalization requirement may be applied toward meeting the equity per member
requirement (see Section D, Paragraph 50, Financial Viability Standards/
Performance Guidelines) and is intended for use in operations of the Contractor.

Continuing Offerors: Continuing offerors that are bidding a county or GSA in
which they currently have a contract must meet the equity per member standard
(see Section D, Paragraph 50, Financial Viability Standards/Performance
Guidelines) for their current membership. Continuing offerors that do not meet
the equity standard must fund, through capital contribution, the necessary
amount to meet the minimum capitalization requirement. Continuing offerors
that are bidding a new GSA must provide the additional capitalization for the
new GSA they are bidding. The amount of the required capitalization for
continuing offers may differ from that for new offerors due to size of the
existing offerors current enrollment. (See the table of requirements by
GSA above).

Continuing offerors will not be required to provide additional capitalization
if they currently meet the equity per member standard with their existing
membership and their excess equity is sufficient to cover the proposed
additional members, or they have at least $10,000,000 in equity.

46. PERFORMANCE BOND OR BOND SUBSTITUTE
The Contractor shall be required to provide a performance bond of standard
commercial scope issued by a surety company doing business in this State, an
irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit (" Performance Bond") to
AHCCCSA for as long as the Contractor has AHCCCS-related liabilities of $50,000
or more outstanding, or 15 months following the effective date of this contract,
whichever is later, to guarantee: (1) payment of the Contractor's obligations
to providers, non-contracting providers, and non-providers; and (2) performance
by the Contractor of its obligations under this contract. The Performance Bond
shall be in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA as described in the AHCCCS Performance
Bond Policy available in the Bidder's Library.

In the event of a default by the Contractor, AHCCCSA shall, in addition to any
other remedies it may have under this contract, obtain payment under the
Performance Bond or substitute security for the purposes of the following:

a. Paying any damages sustained by providers, non-contracting providers and
   non-providers by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under
   this contract,
b. Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any payments made by AHCCCSA on behalf of the
   Contractor, and
c. Reimbursing AHCCCSA for any extraordinary administrative expenses incurred
   by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under this contract,
   including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after termination of this
   contract for reasons other than the convenience of the State by AHCCCSA.

In the event AHCCCSA agrees to accept substitute security in lieu of the
Performance Bond, irrevocable letter of credit or cash deposit, the Contractor
agrees to execute any and all documents and perform any and all acts necessary
to secure and enforce AHCCCSA's security interest in such substitute security
including, but not limited to, security agreements and necessary UCC filings
pursuant to the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code. In the event such substitute
security is agreed to and accepted by AHCCCSA, the Contractor acknowledges that
it has granted AHCCCSA a security interest in such substitute security to
secure performance of its obligations under this contract. The Contractor is
solely responsible for establishing the credit-worthiness of all forms of
substitute security. AHCCCSA may, after written notice to the Contractor,
withdraw its permission for substitute security, in which case the Contractor
shall provide AHCCCSA with a form of security described above. The Contractor
may not change the amount, duration or scope of the performance bond without
prior written approval from AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care.

The Contractor shall not leverage the bond for another loan or create other
creditors using the bond as security.

47. AMOUNT OF PERFORMANCE BOND
The initial amount of the Performance Bond shall be equal to 80% of the total
capitation payment expected to be paid to the Contractor in the month of October
2003, or as determined by AHCCCSA. The total capitation amount shall include
delivery and hospital supplemental payments. This requirement must be satisfied
by the Contractor no later than 30 days after notification by AHCCCSA of the
amount required. Thereafter, AHCCCSA shall evaluate the enrollment statistics
of the Contractor on a monthly basis to determine if the Performance Bond must
be increased. The Contractor shall have 30 days following notification by
AHCCCSA to increase the amount of the Performance Bond. The Performance Bond
amount that must be maintained after the contract term shall be sufficient to
cover all outstanding liabilities and will be determined by AHCCCSA. The
Contractor may not change the amount of the performance bond without prior
written approval from AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care. Refer to the Performance
Bond/ Equity Per Member Policy for more details.

48. ACCUMULATED FUND DEFICIT
The Contractor and its owners shall fund any accumulated fund deficit through
capital contributions in a form acceptable to AHCCCSA within 30 days after
receipt by AHCCCSA of the final audited financial statements, or as otherwise
requested by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA may, at its option, impose enrollment caps in any
or all GSA's as a result of an accumulated deficit, even if unaudited.

49. ADVANCES, DISTRIBUTIONS, LOANS AND INVESTMENTS
The Contractor shall not, without the prior approval of AHCCCSA, make any
advances to a related party or subcontractor. The Contractor shall not,
without similar prior approval, make any distribution, loan or loan guarantee
to any entity, including another fund or line of business within its
organization. All investments, other than investments in U. S. Government
securities or Certificates of Deposit, also require AHCCCSA prior approval.
(See the Reporting Guide for Acute Care Contractors for alternatives to the
prior approval of individual investments.) All requests for prior approval are
to be submitted to the AHCCCSA Office of Managed Care.

50. FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS/PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES
AHCCCSA has established financial viability standards/ performance guidelines.
On a quarterly basis, AHCCCSA will review the following ratios with the purpose
of monitoring the financial health of the Contractor.
The two financial viability standards, the Current Ratio and Equity per
Member, are the standards that best represent the financial solvency of the
Contractor. Therefore, the Contractor must comply with these two financial
viability standards.

AHCCCSA will also monitor the Medical Expense Ratio, the Administrative Cost
Percentage, and the RBUC's Days Outstanding. These guidelines are analyzed as
part of AHCCCSA's due diligence in financial statement monitoring. Sanctions
may not be imposed if the Contractor does not meet these performance guidelines.
AHCCCSA takes into account Contractors' unique programs for managing care and
improving the heath status of members when analyzing medical expense and
administrative ratio results. However, if a critical combination of the
Financial Viability Standards and Performance Guidelines are not met, or if a
Contractor's experience differs significantly from other Contractors',
additional monitoring, such as monthly reporting, may be required.

FINANCIAL VIABILITY STANDARDS

Current Ratio
Current assets divided by current liabilities. "Current assets" includes any
long-term investments that can be converted to cash within 24 hours
without significant penalty (i. e., greater than 20%).

Standard: At least 1.00

If current assets include a receivable from a parent company, the parent
company must have liquid assets that support the amount of the inter-company
loan.

				-53-
<page>

Equity per Member
Equity, less on-balance sheet performance bond, divided by the number of
non-SOBRA Family Planning Extension Services members enrolled at
the end of the period.

Standard: At least $150 for Contractors with enrollment < 100,000
$100 for Contractors with enrollment of 100,000+

For purposes of this measurement, the equity to be measured must be
supported by unencumbered current assets.

(Failure to meet this standard may result in an enrollment cap being
imposed in any or all contracted GSAs.)

PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

Medical Expense Ratio
Total medical expenses divided by total capitation + Delivery Supplement
+ Hospital Supplemental Payment +TPL+ Reinsurance + HIV/ AIDS
Supplement

Standard: At least 80%

Administrative Cost Percentage
Total administrative expenses (excluding income taxes), divided by total
capitation + Delivery Supplement + Hospital Supplemental Payment +
TPL + Reinsurance + HIV/ AIDS Supplement.

Standard: No more than 10%

Received But Unpaid Claims (Days Outstanding)
Received but unpaid claims divided by the average daily medical
expenses for the period, net of sub-capitation expense.
Standard: No more than 30 days

51. SEPARATE INCORPORATION
Within 60 days of contract award, a non-governmental contractor shall have
established a separate corporation for the purposes of this contract,
whose sole activity is the performance of contract function with AHCCCS.

52. MERGER, REORGANIZATION AND CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP
A proposed merger, reorganization or change in ownership of the Contractor
shall require prior approval of AHCCCSA and a subsequent contract amendment.
The Contractor must submit a detailed merger, reorganization
and/or transition plan to AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, for review. The
purpose of the plan review is to
ensure uninterrupted services to members, evaluate the new entity's ability to
support the provider network, ensure that services to members are not
diminished and that major components of the organization and AHCCCS
programs are not adversely affected by such merger, reorganization or change
in ownership.

53. COMPENSATION
The method of compensation under this contract will be Prior Period Coverage
(PPC) capitation, prospective capitation, delivery supplement, hospitalized
supplement for Medical Expense Deduction (MED) members, HIV-AIDS
supplement, reinsurance and third party liability, as described and defined
within this contract and appropriate laws, regulations or policies.

				-54-
<page>

Capitation rates awarded with the RFP will be effective for the period
October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004. Actuaries establish the capitation
rates using practices established by the Actuarial Standards Board.
AHCCCS provides the following data to its actuaries to establish rates for
the purposes of rebasing the capitation rates.

a. Utilization and unit cost data derived from reported encounters
b. Audited financial statements reported by Contractors
c. Local market basket inflation trends
d. AHCCCS fee for service schedule pricing adjustments
e. Programmatic changes that affect reimbursement
f. Additional administrative requirements for Contractors
g. Other changes to medical practices that affect reimbursement

AHCCCS adjusts its rates to best match payment to risk. This further ensures the
actuarial basis for the capitation rates. The following risk factors will be
included for CYE '04:

a. Reinsurance (as described in Paragraph 57)
b. HIV/ AIDS supplemental payment
c. Age/ Gender for the 1931( b), SOBRA, KidsCare and BCCTP eligibility groups
d. Medicare enrollment for SSI members
e. Delivery supplemental payment
f. Hospitalized supplemental payments for MED members
g. Geographic Service Area adjustments
h. Risk sharing for Title XIX Waiver Group reimbursement
i. Risk sharing for PPC reimbursement
j. Member choice statistic for Title XIX Waiver Group

The above information is reviewed by AHCCCS' actuaries in renewal years to
determine if adjustments are necessary to maintain actuarially sound rates.
A Contractor may cover services for members that are not covered
under the State Plan; however those services are not included in the data
provided to actuaries for setting capitation rates. In addition to the above
data used to review the appropriateness of capitation rates, during
renewal years, AHCCCS may look at other factors that potentially impact
appropriate reimbursement including the medical cost experience of members
who exercise their right to choose a health plan upon initial enrollment
versus those who are auto assigned to a health plan.

Prospective Capitation: The Contractor will be paid capitation for all
prospective member months, including partial member months. This capitation
includes the cost of providing medically necessary covered services to
members during the prospective period coverage.

Prior Period Coverage (PPC) Capitation: Except for KidsCare members and HIFA
Parents, the Contractor will be paid capitation for all PPC member months,
including partial member months. This capitation includes the
cost of providing medically necessary covered services to members during prior
period coverage. The PPC capitation rates will be set by AHCCCSA and will be
paid to the Contractor along with the prospective capitation described below.
Contractors will not receive PPC capitation for newborns of members who were
enrolled at the time of delivery.

Reconciliation of PPC Costs to Reimbursement: For CYE '04, AHCCCSA will
reconcile the Contractor's PPC medical cost expenses to PPC capitation paid to
the Contractor during the year. This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's
profits and losses to 2%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the
Contractor, and likewise, profits in excess of 2% will be recouped. Encounter
data will be used to determine medical expenses. Refer to the AHCCCS Office
of Managed Care's PPC Reconciliation Policy for further details.

				-55-
<page>

Risk Sharing for Title XIX Waiver Members: For CYE '04, AHCCCSA will reconcile
the Contractor's PPC and prospective medical cost expenses to PPC capitation,
prospective capitation, hospitalized supplemental payments, delivery
supplemental payments and HIV/ AIDS supplemental payments paid to the Contractor
during the year. This reconciliation will limit the Contractor's profits and
losses to 2%. Any losses in excess of 2% will be reimbursed to the Contractor,
and likewise, profits in excess of 2% will be recouped. Encounter data will be
used to determine medical expenses. Refer to the AHCCCS Office of Managed
Care's Title XIX Waiver Reconciliation Policy for further details.

Delivery Supplement: When the Contractor has an enrolled woman who delivers
during a prospective enrollment period, the Contractor will be entitled to a
supplemental payment. Supplemental payments will not apply to women who deliver
in a prior period coverage time period. AHCCCSA reserves the right at any time
during the term of this contract to adjust the amount of this payment for women
who deliver at home. The delivery supplemental payment is not made if the
hospitalized supplemental payment has already been paid.

Hospitalized Supplemental Payment: If an MED member is an inpatient on the date
of application for AHCCCS eligibility, and the date of application falls within
the member's eligibility period, the Contractor is entitled to a
supplemental payment to help defray costs related to the inpatient stay. The
payment is a one-time supplement that is paid when the member is enrolled with
the Contractor and is subject to review during the term of the contract.

HIV-AIDS Supplement: On a quarterly basis, the Contractor shall submit to
AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, an unduplicated monthly count of members,
by rate code, who are using approved HIV/ AIDS drugs along with the
supporting pharmacy log. The report shall be submitted, along with the quarterly
financial reporting package, within 60 days after the end of each quarter.
AHCCCSA reserves the right to recoup any amounts paid for ineligible members
as well as an associated penalty for incorrect encounter reporting.

Refer to the AHCCCS, Office of Managed Care HIV/ AIDS Supplemental Payment and
Review Policy for further details and requirements.

54. PAYMENTS TO CONTRACTORS
Subject to the availability of funds, AHCCCSA shall make payments to the
Contractor in accordance with the terms of this contract provided that the
Contractor's performance is in compliance with the terms and conditions
of this contract. Payment must comply with requirements of A.R.S. Title 36.
AHCCCSA reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or
National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide
the Contractor at least 30 days notice prior to the effective date of any such
change.

Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, AHCCCSA shall not be
liable for any error or delay in transfer or indirect or consequential damages
arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or
expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by
the Contractor. Except for adjustments made to correct errors in payment, and
as otherwise specified in this section, any savings remaining to the Contractor
as a result of favorable claims experience and efficiencies in service delivery
at the end of the contract term may be kept by the Contractor.

All funds received by the Contractor pursuant to this contract shall be
separately accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Except for funds received from the collection of permitted copayments and
third-party liabilities, the only source of payment to the Contractor for the
services provided hereunder is the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment
System Fund. An error discovered by the State with or without an audit in the
amount of fees paid to the

				-56-
<page>

Contractor will be subject to adjustment or repayment by the Contractor making
a corresponding decrease in a current Contractor's payment or by making an
additional payment by AHCCCSA to the Contractor.

No payment due the Contractor by AHCCCSA may be assigned or pledged by the
Contractor. This section shall not prohibit AHCCCSA at its sole option from
making payment to a fiscal agent hired by Contractor.

55. CAPITATION ADJUSTMENTS
Except for changes made specifically in accordance with this contract, the rates
set forth in Section B shall not be subject to re-negotiation or modification
during the contract period. AHCCCSA may, at its option, review
the effect of a program change and determine if a capitation adjustment is
needed. In these instances the adjustment will be prospective with assumptions
discussed with the Contractor prior to modifying capitation rates. The
Contractor may request a review of a program change if it believes the program
change was not equitable; AHCCCSA will not unreasonably withhold such a review.

If the Contractor is in any manner in default in the performance of any
obligation under this contract, AHCCCSA may, at its option and in addition to
other available remedies, adjust the amount of payment until there is
satisfactory resolution of the default. The Contractor shall reimburse AHCCCSA
and/or AHCCCSA may deduct from future monthly capitation for any portion of a
month during which the Contractor was not at risk due to, for example:

a. death of a member
b. member's incarceration (not eligible for AHCCCS benefits from the date of
   incarceration)
c. duplicate capitation to the same Contractor
d. adjustment based on change in member's contract type
e. voluntary withdrawal

If a member is enrolled twice with the same Contractor, recoupment will be made
as soon as the double capitation is identified. AHCCCSA reserves the right to
modify its policy on capitation recoupments at any time during the term of
this contract.

56. INCENTIVES
AHCCCSA will be implementing an incentive program that utilizes financial
and/or non-financial incentives to promote program quality. AHCCCSA will use
contractor clinical performance indicators in the development of an
incentive program. Examples of incentive programs are listed below.

Auto assignment algorithm: Effective CYE '06, AHCCCSA will adjust the auto
assignment algorithm methodology to incorporate contractor's clinical
performance indicator results in the calculation of target percentages.
AHCCCSA will use the following performance indicators:

	Prenatal Care in the First Trimester
	Well-Child Visits 3-6 Years

Administrative requirements: Effective CYE '06, AHCCCSA may elect to reduce
Operational Financial Review (OFR) requirements for high performing contractors.

Use of Website: Contractors will be required to post their clinical performance
indicators compared to AHCCCS standard and statewide averages on their website.
In addition, AHCCCSA will post contractor performance indicators on its website.

				-57-
<page>

Incentive Fund: AHCCCSA may retain a specified percentage of capitation
reimbursement in order to distribute to Contractors based on their performance
measure outcomes. The incentive fund will not be implemented in CYE '04 and
contractors will be notified at least 60 days prior to implementation in a
future contract year.

57. REINSURANCE
Reinsurance is a stop-loss program provided by AHCCCSA to the Contractor for
the partial reimbursement of covered services, as described below, for a member
with an acute medical condition beyond an annual deductible level. AHCCCSA
"self-insures" the reinsurance program through a deduction to capitation rates
that is intended to be budget neutral. Refer to the AHCCCSA Reinsurance Claims
Processing Manual for further details on the Reinsurance Program.

Inpatient Reinsurance
Inpatient reinsurance covers partial reimbursement of covered inpatient
facility medical services. See the table below for applicable deductible levels
and coinsurance percentages. The coinsurance percent is the rate at which
AHCCCSA will reimburse the Contractor for covered inpatient services incurred
above the deductible. The deductible is the responsibility of the Contractor.
Per diem rates paid for nursing facility services provided within 30 days of
an acute hospital stay, including room and board, provided in lieu of
hospitalization for up to 90 days in any contract year shall be eligible for
reinsurance coverage.

The following table represents anticipated deductible and coinsurance levels
for CYE '04. These deductibles and coinsurance percentages are under review by
actuaries and are subject to change, at the discretion of AHCCCSA, prior to
contract awards. Any change will have a corresponding impact on capitation
rates.

</TABLE>
*applies to all members except for Title XIX Waiver Group members

a) Prospective Reinsurance: This coverage applies to prospective enrollment
periods. The deductible level is based on the Contractor's statewide AHCCCS
acute care enrollment (not including SOBRA Family Planning Extension services)
as of October 1st each contract year for all rate codes and counties, as shown
in the table above. AHCCCSA will adjust the Contractor's deductible level at
the beginning of a contract year if the Contractor's enrollment changes to
the next enrollment level. A Contractor may not elect a lower deductible.
These deductible levels are subject to change by AHCCCSA during the term of
this contract. Any change will have a corresponding impact on capitation rates.

b) Prior Period Coverage Reinsurance: Effective October 1, 2003, AHCCCSA will
no longer cover PPC inpatient expenses under the reinsurance program for any
members except Title XIX Waiver Group members. See section c) below for
additional information.

				-58-
<page>

c) Title XIX Waiver Members: A separate reinsurance deductible for the Title
XIX Waiver Group applies for both the prospective and prior period coverage
time periods. There can only be one reinsurance case for prior period and
prospective enrollment.

Catastrophic Reinsurance
The reinsurance program includes a special Catastrophic Reinsurance program.
This program encompasses members diagnosed with hemophilia, von Willebrand's
Disease, and Gaucher's Disease. For additional detail and restrictions refer
to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual and the AMPM. There
are no deductibles for catastrophic reinsurance cases. All medically necessary
covered services provided during the contract year shall be eligible for
reimbursement at 85% of the Contractor's paid amount. All catastrophic claims
are subject to medical review by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of Managed Care, Reinsurance Unit,
of cases identified for catastrophic reinsurance coverage within 30 days of
(a) initial diagnosis, (b) enrollment with the Contractor, and (c) the
beginning of each contract year. Catastrophic reinsurance will be paid for a
maximum 30-day retroactive period from the date of notification to AHCCCSA.
The determination of whether a case or type of case is catastrophic shall be
made by the Director or designee based on the following criteria; 1) severity of
medical condition, including prognosis; and 2) the average cost or average
length of hospitalization and medical care, or both, in Arizona, for the
type of case under consideration.

HEMOPHILIA: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for all members
diagnosed with Hemophilia (ICD9 codes 286.0, 286.1, 286.2).

VON WILLEBRAND'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance coverage is available for
all members diagnosed with von Willebrand's Disease who are non-DDAVP responders
and dependent on Plasma Factor VIII.

GAUCHER'S DISEASE: Catastrophic reinsurance is available for members diagnosed
with Gaucher's Disease classified as Type I and are dependent on enzyme
replacement therapy.

Transplants
This program covers members who are eligible to receive covered major organ and
tissue transplantation including bone marrow, heart, heart/ lung, lung, liver,
kidney, and other organ transplantation. Bone grafts and cornea transplantation
services are not eligible for transplant reinsurance coverage but are eligible
under the regular inpatient reinsurance program. Refer to the AMPM for covered
services for organ and tissue transplants. Reinsurance coverage for transplants
is limited to 85% of the AHCCCS contract amount for the
transplantation services rendered, or 85% of the Contractor's paid amount,
whichever is lower. The AHCCCS contracted transplantation rates may be found in
the Bidder's Library. When a member is referred to a transplant facility for an
AHCCCS-covered organ transplant, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA, Office of
Medical Management.

Other
For all reinsurance case types other than transplants, Contractors will be
reimbursed 100% for all medically necessary covered expenses provided in a
contract year, after the reinsurance case reaches $650,000.
Transplant case types have another risk limitation methodology described in the
AHCCCSA Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual.

Encounter Submission and Payments for Reinsurance

a) Encounter Submission: A Contractor shall prepare, review, verify, certify,
and submit, encounters for consideration to AHCCCSA. Upon submission, the
Contractor certifies that the services listed were actually rendered. The
encounters must be submitted in the format prescribed by AHCCCSA. The
Contractor must initiate and evaluate an encounter for probable 1st and 3rd
party liability before submitting the encounter for reinsurance consideration,
unless the encounter involves underinsured or uninsured motorist liability
insurance, 1st and 3rd party liability insurance or a tort feasor.

The Contractor must maintain evidence that costs incurred have been paid by the
Contractor before submitting reinsurance encounters. This information is
subject to AHCCCSA review. Collections from 1st and 3rd parties should be
reflected by the Contractor as reductions in the encounters submitted on a
dollar-for-dollar basis. For purposes of AHCCCSA reinsurance, payments made
by Contractor-purchased reinsurance are not considered 1st and 3rd party
collections.

All reinsurance claims must reach a clean claim status within fifteen months
from the end date of service, or date of eligibility posting, whichever is
later.

b) Encounter Processing: AHCCCSA will accept for processing only those
encounters that are submitted directly by an AHCCCS Contractor and that comply
with the AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User Manual.

c) Payment of Inpatient and Catastrophic Reinsurance Cases: AHCCCSA will
reimburse a Contractor for costs incurred in excess of the applicable
deductible level, subject to coinsurance percentages. Amounts in excess of the
deductible level shall be paid based upon costs paid by the Contractor, minus
the coinsurance unless the costs are paid under a subcapitated arrangement.
In subcapitated arrangements, the Administration shall base reimbursement of
reinsurance encounters on the lower of the AHCCCS allowed amount or the
reported health plan paid amount, minus the coinsurance and Medicare/TPL
payment and applicable quick pay discounts.

Reimbursement for these reinsurance benefits will be made to the Contractor
each month. AHCCCSA will also provide a reconciliation of reinsurance payments
in the case where encounters used in the calculation of reinsurance benefits
are subsequently adjusted or voided.

When a member with an annual enrollment choice changes Contractors within a
contract year, for reinsurance purposes, all eligible inpatient costs, nursing
facility costs and inpatient psychiatric costs incurred for that member will
follow the member to the receiving health plan. Therefore, all submitted
encounters from the health plan the member is leaving (for dates of service
within the current contract year) will be applied toward, but not exceed,
the receiving health plan's deductible level. For further details regarding
this policy and other reinsurance policies refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance
Claims Processing Manual.

d) Payment of Transplant Reinsurance Cases: Reinsurance benefits are based upon
the lower of the AHCCCS contract amount or the Contractor's paid amount, subject
to coinsurance percentages. While encounter data is not currently used to
determine reinsurance payments for transplant services, in the future,
encounters may be required in order for Contractors to receive reinsurance
payments for transplants. Contractors are required to encounter all medical
services provided for which a financial liability is incurred.
Please refer to the AHCCCS Reinsurance Claims Processing Manual for the
appropriate billing of transplant services. Reimbursement for these reinsurance
benefits will be made to the Contractor each month.

Reinsurance Audits

Pre-audit: Medical audits on prospective and prior period coverage reinsurance
cases will be determined based on statistically valid retrospective random
sampling. For closed contracts, a 100% audit will be conducted. AHCCCSA, Office
of Managed Care, Reinsurance Unit, will generate the sampling and will
notify the Contractor of documentation needed for the retrospective medical
audit process to occur at the Contractor's offices.

On-site Audit: AHCCCSA will give the Contractor at least 45 days advance notice
of any on-site audit. The Contractor shall have all requested medical records
and financial documentation on-site and available to the nurse auditors. Any
documents not requested in advance by AHCCCSA shall be made available upon
request of the Audit Team during the course of the audit. The Contractor
representative shall be available to the Audit Team at all times during AHCCCSA
on-site audit activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Audit
Team with workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences.

Audit Considerations: Reinsurance consideration will be given to inpatient
facility contracts and hearing decisions rendered by the Office of Legal
Assistance. Pre-hearing and/ or hearing penalties discoverable during the
review process will not be reimbursed under reinsurance.

Per diem rates may be paid for nursing facility and rehabilitation services
provided the services are rendered within 30 days of an acute hospital stay,
including room and board, provided in lieu of hospitalization for up to
90 days in any contract year. The services rendered in these sub-acute settings
must be of an acute nature and, in the case of rehabilitative or restorative
services, steady progress must be documented in the medical record.

Audit Determinations: The Contractor will be furnished a copy of the Reinsurance
Post-Audit Results letter approximately 60 days after the onsite audit and given
an opportunity to comment and provide additional medical or financial
documentation on any audit findings. AHCCCSA may limit reinsurance reimbursement
to a lower or alternative level of care if the Director or designee determines
that the less costly alternative could and should have been used by the
Contractor.

A recoupment of reinsurance reimbursements made to the Contractor may occur
based on the results of the medical audit sampling. The results of the medical
audit sampling may be separately extrapolated to the entire prospective and
prior period coverage reinsurance reimbursement populations in the audit
timeframe for the Contractor.

A Contractor whose reinsurance case is reduced or denied shall be notified in
writing by AHCCCSA and will be informed of rationale for reduction or denial
determination and the applicable grievance and appeal process available.

58. COORDINATION OF BENEFITS/THIRD PARTY LIABILITY
By law, AHCCCSA is the payer of last resort. This means AHCCCSA shall be used
as a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of
payment have been exhausted. The two methods used in the coordination of
benefits are cost avoidance and post payment recovery. The Contractor shall use
these methods as described in A. A. C. R9-22-1001. (See also Section D,
Paragraph 60, Medicare Services and Cost Sharing).

Cost Avoidance: The Contractor shall cost-avoid all claims or services that are
subject to third-party payment and may deny a service to a member if it knows
that a third party (i. e. other insurer) will provide the service.
However, if a third-party insurer (other than Medicare) requires the member to
pay any copayment, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for
making these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the
Contractor's network. The Contractor's liability for copayments, coinsurance and
deductibles is limited to what the Contractor would have paid for the entire
service pursuant to a written contract with the provider or the AHCCCS
fee-for-service rate, less any amount paid by the third party. (The

				-61-
<page>

Contractor must decide whether it is more cost-effective to provide the service
within its network or pay coinsurance and deductibles for a service outside its
network. For continuity of care, the Contractor may also choose to provide the
service within its network.) If the Contractor refers the member for services to
 a third-party insurer (other than Medicare), and the insurer requires payment
in advance of all copayments, coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must
make such payments in advance.

If the Contractor knows that the third party insurer will neither pay for nor
provide the covered service, and the service is medically necessary, the
Contractor shall not deny the service nor require a written denial letter. If
the Contractor does not know whether a particular service is covered by the
third party, and the service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall
contact the third party and determine whether or not such service is covered
rather than requiring the member to do so.

The requirement to cost-avoid applies to all AHCCCS covered services. For
prenatal care and preventive pediatric services, AHCCCS may require the
Contractor to provide such service and then coordinate payment with the
potentially liable third party (" pay and chase"). In emergencies, the
Contractor shall provide the necessary services and then coordinate payment
with the third-party payer. The Contractor shall also provide medically
necessary transportation so the member can receive third-party benefits.
Further, if a service is medically necessary, the Contractor shall ensure that
its cost avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving such service
and that the member shall not be required to pay any coinsurance or deductibles
for use of the other insurer's providers.

Postpayment Recoveries: Postpayment recovery is necessary in cases where the
Contractor was not aware of third-party coverage at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The Contractor shall
identify all potentially liable third parties and pursue reimbursement from
them except in the circumstances below. The Contractor shall not pursue
reimbursement in the following circumstances unless the case has been referred
to the Contractor by AHCCCSA or AHCCCSA's authorized representative:

Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance 	Restitution Recovery
First-and third-party liability insurance 	Worker's Compensation
Tortfeasors, including casualty 	  	Estate recovery
Special Treatment Trusts recovery

The Contractor shall report any cases involving the above circumstances to
AHCCCSA's authorized representative should the Contractor identify such a
situation. See AHCCCS Rule R9-22-1002 and R9-31-1002. The Contractor shall
cooperate with AHCCCSA's authorized representative in all collection efforts.
In joint cases involving both AHCCCS fee-for-service or reinsurance and the
Contractor, AHCCCSA's authorized representative is responsible for performing
all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to
the referral of any and all relevant case information to AHCCCSA's authorized
representative by the Contractor. AHCCCSA's authorized representative is also
responsible for negotiating and acting in the best interest of all parties to
obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases and may compromise a settlement
in order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal and other costs. The
Contractor will be responsible for their prorated share of the contingency fee.
 The Contractor's share of the contingency fee will be deducted from the
settlement proceeds prior to AHCCCSA remitting the settlement to the Contractor.
For total plan cases involving only payments from the Contractor, the
Contractor is responsible for performing all research, investigation, the
filing of liens and payment of lien filing fees and other related costs. The
Contractor shall use the cover sheet as prescribed by AHCCCS when filing liens.

The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its third-party collections if all of
the following conditions exist:

a. Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the
   Contractor's financial liability for the member

				-62-
<page>

b. There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service, reinsurance
   or administrative costs (i. e. lien filing and contingency fees, etc.)
c. Such recovery is not prohibited by State or Federal law

Reporting: The Contractor may be required to report case level detail of
third-party collections and cost avoidance, including number of referrals on
total plan cases. In addition, upon AHCCCSA's request, the Contractor shall
provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed
cases. Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member's first and
last name; AHCCCS ID; date of incident; claimed amount; paid/ recovered amount;
and case status. The AHCCCSA TPL Section shall provide the
format and reporting schedule for this information to the Contractor. The
Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA's authorized representative within five working
days of the identification of a third-party liability case with reinsurance.
Failure to report reinsurance cases may result in one of the remedies specified
in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions. The Contractor shall communicate any
known change in health insurance information, including Medicare, to AHCCCS
Administration, Division of Member Services, not later than 10 days from the
date of discovery using the AHCCCS Third-Party Coverage Form found in the
Bidder's Library.

AHCCCSA will provide the Contractor, on an agreed upon schedule, with a
complete file of all third-party coverage information (other than Medicare) for
the purpose of updating the Contractor's files. The Contractor shall notify
AHCCCSA of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format
prescribed by AHCCCSA.

Title XXI (KidsCare), HIFA Parents and BCCTP: Eligibility for KidsCare, HIFA
Parents and BCCTP benefits require that the applicant/ member not be enrolled
with any other creditable health insurance plan. If the Contractor becomes
aware of any such coverage, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA immediately.
AHCCCSA will determine if the other insurance meets the creditable definition
in A.R.S. 36-2982( G).

Contract Termination: Upon termination of this contract, the Contractor will
complete the existing third party liability cases or make any necessary
arrangements to transfer the cases to AHCCCSA's authorized TPL representative.

59. COPAYMENTS
The Contractor is responsible for the collection of copayments from members in
accordance with AHCCCS Rules R9-22-711 and R9-31-711, and 42 CFR 447. Services
may not be denied for inability to pay the copayment. Any required copayments
collected shall belong to the Contractor or its subcontractors.

The Contractor may not collect copayments for the following services:

a. Prenatal care including all obstetrical visits;
b. Well-baby and EPSDT care;
c. Care in nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities for the mentally
   retarded;
d. Visits scheduled by a primary care physician or practitioner, and not at the
   request of a member;
e. Drugs and medications;
f. Family planning services;
g. Translation and interpreter services.

A provider shall not bill a member for more than the statutory copayment amount.
Refer to Section D, Paragraphs 58, Coordination of Benefits/Third Party
Liability, Paragraph 60, Medicare Services and Cost Sharing, and R9-22-702
for exceptions.

				-63-
<page>

60. MEDICARE SERVICES AND COST SHARING
AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.
These members are referred to as "dual eligibles". Generally, Contractors are
responsible for payment of Medicare coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered
services provided to dual eligible members. However, there are different cost
sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety
of factors. Unless prior approval is obtained from AHCCCSA, the Contractor must
limit their cost sharing responsibility according to the AHCCCS Medicare Cost
Sharing Policy. The Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the
Medicare payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same
service of a non-Medicare member.

61. MARKETING
The Contractor shall submit all proposed marketing and outreach materials and
events that will involve the general public to the AHCCCS Marketing Committee
for prior approval in accordance with the AHCCCS Health Plan Marketing Policy.
The Contractor must have signed contracts with PCPs, specialists, dentists,
and pharmacies in order for them to be included in marketing materials.

62. CORPORATE COMPLIANCE
In accordance with A.R.S. Section 36-2918.01, all contractors are required to
notify the AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity immediately of all suspected
fraud or abuse. The Contractor agrees to promptly (within ten working days of
discovery) inform the Office of Program Integrity in writing of instances of
suspected fraud or abuse. This shall include acts of suspected fraud or abuse
that were resolved internally but involved AHCCCS funds, contractors or
sub-contractors.

As stated in A.R.S. Section 13-2310, incorporated herein by reference, any
person who knowingly obtains any benefit by means of false or fraudulent
pretenses, representations, promises, or material omissions is guilty of a
Class 2 felony.

The Contractor agrees to permit and cooperate with any onsite review. A review
by the AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity may be conducted without notice and
for the purpose of ensuring program compliance.

Effective October 1, 2003, the Contractor shall be in compliance with 42 CFR
438.608. The Contractor must have a mandatory compliance program, supported by
other administrative procedures, that is designed to guard against fraud and
abuse.

The compliance program, which shall both prevent and detect suspected fraud or
abuse, must include:

1. Written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct that articulate the
   organization's commitment to and processes for complying with all applicable
   federal and state standards.
2. The designation of a compliance officer and a compliance committee.
3. Effective training and education.
4. Effective lines of communication between the compliance officer and the
   organization's employees.
5. Enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary guidelines.
6. Provision for internal monitoring and auditing.
7. Provision for prompt response to problems detected.

The Contractor is required to research potential overpayments identified by the
AHCCCS, Office of Program Integrity. After conducting a cost benefit analysis
to determine if such action is warranted, the Contractor

				-64-
<page>

should attempt to recover any overpayments identified. The AHCCCS Office of
Program Integrity shall be advised of the final disposition of the research and
advised of actions, if any, taken by the Contractor.

63. RECORDS RETENTION
The Contractor shall maintain books and records relating to covered services
and expenditures including reports to AHCCCSA and working papers used in the
preparation of reports to AHCCCSA. The Contractor shall comply with all
specifications for record keeping established by AHCCCSA. All books and records
shall be maintained to the extent and in such detail as required by AHCCCS
Rules and policies. Records shall include but not be limited to financial
statements, records relating to the quality of care, medical records,
prescription files and other records specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor agrees to make available, at all reasonable times during the
term of this contract, any of its records for inspection, audit or reproduction
by any authorized representative of AHCCCSA, State or Federal government.
The Contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with the
reproduction of requested information.

The Contractor shall preserve and make available all records for a period of
five years from the date of final payment under this contract.

If this contract is completely or partially terminated, the records relating to
the work terminated shall be preserved and made available for a period of
five years from the date of any such termination. Records which relate to
grievances, disputes, litigation or the settlement of claims arising out of the
performance of this contract, or costs and expenses of this contract to which
exception has been taken by AHCCCSA, shall be retained by the Contractor for
a period of five years after the date of final disposition or resolution
thereof.

64. DATA EXCHANGE REQUIREMENTS
The Contractor is authorized to exchange data with AHCCCSA relating to the
information requirements of this contract and as required to support the data
elements to be provided AHCCCSA in the formats prescribed by AHCCCSA and in
formats prescribed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). Details for the formats may be found in the draft HIPAA Transaction
Companion Documents & Trading Partner Agreements, and in the AHCCCS Technical
Interface Guidelines, available in the Bidder's Library.

The information so recorded and submitted to AHCCCSA shall be in accordance
with all procedures, policies, rules, or statutes in effect during the term of
this contract. If any of these procedures, policies, rules, regulations or
statutes are hereinafter changed both parties agree to conform to these changes
following appropriate notification to both parties by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for any incorrect data, delayed submission or
payment (to the Contractor or its subcontractors), and/or penalty applied due
to any error, omission, deletion, or erroneous insert caused by
Contractor-submitted data. Any data that does not meet the standards required
by AHCCCSA shall not be accepted by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor is responsible for identifying any inconsistencies immediately
upon receipt of data from AHCCCSA. If any unreported inconsistencies are
subsequently discovered, the Contractor shall be responsible for the necessary
adjustments to correct its records at its own expense.

				-65-
<page>

The Contractor shall accept from AHCCCSA original evidence of eligibility and
enrollment in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange. Upon request
by AHCCCSA, the Contractor shall provide to AHCCCSA updated date-sensitive PCP
assignments in a form appropriate for electronic data exchange.

The Contractor shall be provided with a Contractor-specific security code for
use in all data transmissions made in accordance with contract requirements.
Each data transmission by the Contractor shall include the Contractor's
security code. The Contractor agrees that by use of its security code, it
certifies that any data transmitted is accurate and truthful, to the best of
the Contractor's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or designee's
knowledge. The Contractor further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
State of Arizona and AHCCCSA from any and all claims or liabilities, including
but not limited to consequential damages, reimbursements or erroneous billings
and reimbursements of attorney fees incurred as a consequence of any error,
omission, deletion or erroneous insert caused by the Contractor in the
submitted input data. Neither the State of Arizona nor AHCCCSA shall be
responsible for any incorrect or delayed payment to the Contractor's AHCCCS
services providers (subcontractors) resulting from such error, omission,
deletion, or erroneous input data caused by the Contractor in the submission of
AHCCCS claims.

The costs of software changes are included in administrative costs paid to the
Contractor. There is no separate payment for software changes. A PMMIS systems
contact will be assigned after contract award. AHCCCSA will work with the
health plans as they evaluate Electronic Data Interchange options.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): The Contractor
shall comply with the Administrative Simplification requirements of Subpart F
of the HIPAA of 1996 (Public Law 107-191, 110 Statutes 1936) and all Federal
regulations implementing that Subpart that are applicable to the operations of
the Contractor by the dates required by the implementing Federal regulations.

65. ENCOUNTER DATA REPORTING
The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is crucial to the success
of the AHCCCS program. AHCCCSA uses encounter data to pay reinsurance benefits,
set fee-for-service and capitation rates, determine disproportionate share
payments to hospitals, and to determine compliance with performance standards.
The Contractor shall submit encounter data to AHCCCSA for all services rendered,
including services provided during prior period coverage. This requirement is
a condition of the CMS grant award.

A Contractor shall prepare, review, verify, certify, and submit, encounters for
consideration to AHCCCSA. Upon submission, the Contractor certifies that the
services listed were actually rendered. The encounters must be submitted in the
format prescribed by AHCCCSA.

Encounter data must be provided to AHCCCSA by electronic media and must be
submitted in the PMMIS AHCCCSA supplied formats. Specific requirements for
encounter data are described in the AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User Manual,
a copy of which may be found in the Bidder's Library. The Encounter Submission
Requirements are included herein as Attachment I. Refer to Paragraph 64, Data
Exchange Requirements, for further information.

An Encounter Submission Tracking Report must be maintained and made available
to AHCCCSA upon request. The Tracking Report's purpose is to link each claim
to an adjudicated or pended encounter returned to the Contractor. Further
information regarding the Encounter Submission Tracking Report may be found
in The AHCCCSA Encounter Reporting User's Manual.

Each month AHCCCSA provides the Contractor with full replacement files
containing provider and medical procedure coding information. These files
should be used to assist the Contractor in accurate Encounter Reporting.
Refer to Paragraph 64, Data Exchange Requirements, for further information.

				-66-
<page>

66. ENROLLMENT AND CAPITATION TRANSACTION UPDATES
AHCCCSA produces daily enrollment transaction updates identifying new members
and changes to members' demographic, eligibility and enrollment data, which the
Contractor shall use to update its member records. The daily enrollment
transaction update, which is run prior to the monthly enrollment and capitation
transaction update, is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all
rate code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new
enrollments and disenrollments.

AHCCCSA also produces a daily Manual Payment Transaction, which identifies
enrollment or disenrollment activity that was not included on the daily
enrollment transaction update due to internal edits. The Contractor
shall use the Manual Payment Transaction in addition to the daily enrollment
transaction update to update its member records.

A weekly capitation transaction will be produced to provide contractors with
member-level capitation payment information. This file will show changes to the
prospective capitation payments, as sent in the monthly file, resulting from
enrollment changes that occur after the monthly file is produced. This file will
also identify mass adjustments to and/ or manual capitation payments that
occurred at AHCCCS after the monthly file is produced.

The monthly enrollment and monthly capitation transaction updates are generally
produced two days before the end of every month. The update will identify the
total active population for the Contractor as of the first day of
the next month. These updates contain the information used by AHCCCSA to
produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month. The Contractor
will reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly update.
After reconciling the monthly update information, the Contractor resumes
posting daily updates beginning with the last two days of the month. The last
two daily updates are different from the regular daily updates in that they
pay and/ or recoup capitation into the next month. If the Contractor detects an
error through the monthly update process, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCSA,
Office of Managed Care.

Refer to Paragraph 64, Data Exchange Requirements, for further information.

67. PERIODIC REPORT REQUIREMENTS
AHCCCSA, under the terms and conditions of its CMS grant award, requires
periodic reports, encounter data, and other information from the Contractor.
The submission of late, inaccurate, or otherwise incomplete reports
shall constitute failure to report subject to the penalty provisions described
in this contract.

Standards applied for determining adequacy of required reports are as follows:

a. Timeliness: Reports or other required data shall be received on or before
   scheduled due dates.
b. Accuracy: Reports or other required data shall be prepared in strict
   conformity with appropriate authoritative sources and/ or AHCCCS defined
   standards.
c. Completeness: All required information shall be fully disclosed in a manner
   that is both responsive and pertinent to report intent with no material
   omissions.

AHCCCS requirements regarding reports, report content and frequency of
submission of reports are subject to change at any time during the term of the
contract. The Contractor shall comply with all changes specified by AHCCCSA.

The Contractor shall be responsible for continued reporting beyond the term of
the contract. For example, processing claims and reporting encounter data will
likely continue beyond the term of the contract because of lag
time in filing source documents by subcontractors.

				-67-
<page>

The Contractor shall comply with all financial reporting requirements contained
in the Reporting Guide for Acute Health Care Contractors with the Arizona
Health Care Cost Containment System, a copy of which may be found
in the Bidder's Library. The required reports, which are subject to change
during the contract term, are summarized in Attachment F, Periodic Report
Requirements.

68. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION
AHCCCSA may, at any time during the term of this contract, request financial or
other information from the Contractor. Upon receipt of such requests for
information, the Contractor shall provide complete information as
requested no later than 30 days after the receipt of the request unless
otherwise specified in the request itself.

69. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION
Upon request, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCSA in the dissemination of
information prepared by AHCCCSA or the Federal government to its members.
The cost of such dissemination shall be borne by the Contractor. All
advertisements, publications and printed materials that are produced by the
Contractor and refer to covered services shall state that such services are
funded under contract with AHCCCSA.

70. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL READINESS REVIEWS
AHCCCSA may conduct Operational and Financial Readiness Reviews on all
successful offerors and will, subject to the availability of resources, provide
technical assistance as appropriate. The Readiness Reviews will be conducted
prior to the start of business. The purpose of Readiness Reviews is to assess
new Contractors' readiness and ability to provide covered services to members
at the start of the contract year and current Contractors' readiness to expand
to new geographic service areas. A new Contractor will be permitted to
commence operations only if the Readiness Review factors are met to AHCCCSA's
satisfaction.

71. OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS
In accordance with CMS requirements, AHCCCSA, or an independent external agent,
will conduct annual Operational and Financial Reviews for the purpose of (but
not limited to) ensuring operational and financial program compliance.
The reviews will identify areas where improvements can be made and make
recommendations accordingly, monitor the Contractor's progress towards
implementing mandated programs and provide the Contractor with technical
assistance if necessary. The Contractor shall comply with all other medical
audit provisions as required by AHCCCS Rule R9-22-521 and R9-31-521.

The type and duration of the Operational and Financial Review will be solely at
the discretion of AHCCCSA. Except in cases where advance notice is not possible
or advance notice may render the review less useful, AHCCCSA will give the
Contractor at least three weeks advance notice of the date of the on-site
review. In preparation for the on-site Operational and Financial Reviews, the
Contractor shall cooperate fully with AHCCCSA and the AHCCCSA Review Team by
forwarding in advance such policies, procedures, job descriptions, contracts,
logs and other information that AHCCCSA may request. The Contractor shall have
all requested medical records on-site. Any documents, not requested in advance
by AHCCCSA, shall be made available upon request of the Review Team during the
course of the review. The Contractor personnel, as identified in advance,
shall be available to the Review Team at all times during AHCCCSA on-site
review activities. While on-site, the Contractor shall provide the Review Team
with workspace, access to a telephone, electrical outlets and privacy for
conferences. Certain documentation submission requirements may be waived at
the discretion of AHCCCSA, if the Contractor has obtained accreditation from
NCQA, JCAHO or any other

				-68-
<page>

nationally recognized accrediting body. The Contractor must submit the entire
accreditation report to AHCCCSA for such waiver consideration.

The Contractor will be furnished a draft copy of the Operational and Financial
Review Report and given an opportunity to comment on any review findings prior
to AHCCCSA publishing the final report. Operational and Financial Review
findings may be used in the scoring of subsequent bid proposals by that
Contractor.

Recommendations, made by the Review Team to bring the Contractor into compliance
with Federal, State, AHCCCS, and/ or RFP requirements, must be implemented by
the Contractor. AHCCCSA may conduct a follow-up Operational and Financial
Review to determine the Contractor's progress in implementing recommendations
and achieving program compliance. Follow-up reviews may be conducted at any
time after the initial Operational and Financial Review.

AHCCCSA may conduct an Operational and Financial Review in the event the
Contractor undergoes a merger, reorganization, change in ownership or makes
changes in three or more key staff positions within a 12-month period.

72. SANCTIONS
AHCCCSA may impose monetary sanctions, suspend, deny, refuse to renew, or
terminate this contract or any related subcontracts in accordance with AHCCCS
Rules R9-22-606 and the terms of this contract and applicable Federal or
State law and regulations. Written notice will be provided to the Contractor
specifying the sanction to be imposed, the grounds for such sanction and either
the length of suspension or the amount of capitation prepayment to be withheld.
The Contractor may appeal the decision to impose a sanction in accordance with
A. A. C. 22, Article 8. Intermediate sanctions may be imposed, but are not
limited to the following actions:

a. Substantial failure to provide medically necessary services that the
   Contractor is required to provide under the terms of this contract to its
   enrolled members.
b. Imposition of premiums or charges in excess of the amount allowed under the
   AHCCCS 1115 Waiver.
c. Discrimination among enrollees on the basis of their health status of need
   for health care services.
d. Misrepresentation or falsification of information furnished to CMS or
   AHCCCSA.
e. Misrepresentation or falsification of information furnished to an enrollee,
   potential enrollee, or provider.
f. Failure to comply with the requirement for physician incentive plan as
   delineated in Paragraph 42.
g. Distribution directly, or indirectly through any agent or independent
   contractor, of marketing materials that have not been approved by AHCCCSA or
   that contain false or materially misleading information.
h. Failure to meet AHCCCS Financial Viability Standards.
i. Material deficiencies in the Contractor's provider network.
j. Failure to meet quality of care and quality management requirements.
k. Failure to meet AHCCCS encounter standards.

   CFR 438.706 and A.R.S. Sec.36-2903 (M).
c. Granting enrollees the right to terminate enrollment without cause and
   notifying the affected enrollees of their right to disenroll.
d. Suspension of all new enrollment, including auto assignments after the
   effective date of the sanction.

				-69-
<page>

e. Suspension of payment for recipients enrolled after the effective date of
   the sanction until CMS or AHCCCSA is satisfied that the reason for
   imposition of the sanction no longer exists and is not likely to recur.
f. Additional sanctions allowed under statue or regulation that address areas
   of noncompliance, such as termination of the contract.

Cure Notice Process: Prior to the imposition of a sanction for non-compliance,
AHCCCSA may provide a written cure notice to the Contractor regarding the
details of the non-compliance. The cure notice will specify the period of time
during which the Contractor must bring its performance back into compliance

75. PENDING LEGISLATIVE / OTHER ISSUES
The following constitute pending items that will be resolved after the initial
issuance of the RFP document. Any program changes due to the resolution of the
issues will be reflected in future amendments to the RFP. Final
awarded capitation rates may also be adjusted to reflect the financial impact
of program changes.

Prescription Drugs: The Governor of Arizona issued an Executive Order,
available on the AHCCCS website, requiring AHCCCSA to explore carving out the
prescription drug benefit from capitation in order to participate in
the Federal Drug Rebate Program. As a result, the Contractor is required to
submit two capitation rate proposals, one with and one without prescription
drug costs and utilization. Refer to the Section C, Definitions and Section
I, Instructions to Offerors, for more detail.

Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program: Legislation to extend the Pilot program
may be introduced effective for contract years beginning CYE '04. See Paragraph
40, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, for additional information on
the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program. The Pilot program is scheduled to
terminate September 30, 2003.

Hospice services for members age 21 and older: AHCCCSA is considering adding
hospice services as a benefit for members age 21 and older and is undergoing
the approval process, which includes an amendment to AHCCCS' state plan with
CMS.

Transplant Contracts: AHCCCSA is currently negotiating new contracts for organ
and tissue transplants, to be effective October 1, 2003. Contracted rates will
be published as soon as they are finalized.

Transplants: AHCCCSA may evaluate carving out transplant services from the
compendium of services for which AHCCCS Contractors are responsible. If AHCCCSA
determines that carving out the responsibility for transplant services is
appropriate, an RFP will be issued for the program. AHCCCSA does not anticipate
a carve out in CYE '04.

Transportation: AHCCCSA is evaluating its methodology, under capitation, for
providing transportation services to its members. Options may include
contracting with a centralized transportation broker to provide services to all
AHCCCS members. AHCCCSA does not anticipate a carve out in CYE '04.

Member Cost Sharing: AHCCCSA submitted a report to the Arizona Legislature on
possibilities for increasing AHCCCS' member cost sharing responsibilities. This
report may be found on the AHCCCS website. Changes include increases to
copayment amounts and collection of premiums. AHCCCSA is seeking CMS approval
to expand member cost sharing responsibility. Refer to the AHCCCS website for a
copy of the Cost Sharing Report.

76. BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1997 (BBA)
In August of 2002, CMS issued final regulations for the implementation of the
BBA. AHCCCS is currently reviewing all areas of the regulations to ensure full
compliance with the BBA; however, there are some issues that require further
clarification from CMS. The following items related to the BBA regulations are
pending. Any program changes due to the resolution of the issues will be
reflected in amendments to the RFP. Final awarded capitation rates may be also
be adjusted to reflect the financial impact of the program changes.

Grievances: AHCCCSA has not reached a final decision on whether it will
implement the option for a member to request an expedited hearing directly from
AHCCCSA. The final decision will be communicated through a future amendment
to this RFP.

				-71-
<page>

Special Healthcare Needs: AHCCCSA is in the process of determining the impact
of the BBA regulations regarding individuals with special healthcare needs.
The AMPM will be expanded to address policies related to this population.

PPC Time Period for MED Population: AHCCCSA is determining how to handle
reimbursement to the Contractor for the day a member meets spend down
requirements.

Policies: AHCCCSA is currently revising policies, as needed, to reflect the BBA
regulations. As the policies are updated, they will be issued to all offerors
via the AHCCCS web under "Bidder's Library". If a policy is finalized
after the contracts bids are awarded, they will be issued to all Contractors,
both via the website and in hard copy. Examples of AHCCCS policies currently
under revision include the AMPM, Sanctions Policy, Member Information Policy
and the Health Plan Marketing Policy.

77. HEALTHCARE GROUP OF ARIZONA
AHCCCSA encourages all Contractors to participate in the Healthcare Group (HCG)
program. Legislation was passed in 2002 that shifted administrative
responsibilities from HCG contractors to AHCCCSA. Additionally, effective
February 1, 2003, HCG's service package and premium structure has been
redesigned to better reflect the small group product in the Arizona
marketplace. HCG has created a niche market, as insurance companies are
moving away from the Health Maintenance Organization market. HCG hopes to
expand its enrollment significantly during the next two years, which will
result in a solid membership base to spread risk, thereby
increasing the attractiveness of the HCG product. For additional information,
contact AHCCCSA, Office of the Director.

SECTION H: EVALUATION FACTORS AND SELECTION PROCESS

AHCCCSA has established a scoring methodology which is designed to evaluate
fairly an offeror's ability to provide cost-effective, high-quality contract
services in a managed care setting in accordance with the AHCCCS
overall mission and goals. The following factors will be evaluated and
weighted in the order listed:

1. Provider Network
2. Capitation
3. Program
4. Organization
5. Extra Credit (optional)

It is anticipated that Capitation and the network development portion of
Provider Network will be scored by Geographic Service Area. The remaining
submission areas: the network management portion of Provider Network, Program,
Organization and Extra Credit, are anticipated to be scored statewide, not
specific to any Geographic Service Area (GSA). The scores received for each of
the four required components will be weighted separately and combined to
derive a final score for the Offeror, by GSA, prior to adding any extra credit
earned. Contracts will be awarded to qualified offerors whose proposals are
deemed to be most advantageous to the State in accordance with Section I,
Paragraph 9, Award of Contract.

In the case of negligible differences between two or more competing proposals
for a particular GSA, in the best interest of the state, AHCCCSA may consider
the following factors in awarding the contract:

  *an Offeror who is an incumbent health plan and has performed in an adequate
   manner (in the interest of continuity of care); and/or
  *an Offeror who participates satisfactorily in other lines of AHCCCS business;
   and/or
  *an Offeror's past performance with AHCCCS.

Offerors are encouraged to submit a bid for more than one GSA and/ or for more
than just urban GSAs.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to waive immaterial defects or omissions in this
solicitation or submitted proposals. The Offeror should note that, if
successful, it must meet all AHCCCS requirements, irrespective of what is
requested and evaluated through this solicitation. The proposal provided by
the Offeror will become part of the contract with AHCCCS.
________________________________________________________________________________
All of the components listed below will be evaluated against relevant statutes,
AHCCCSA rules and policies and the requirements contained in this RFP.
The Offeror's Checklist (Attachment K) contains RFP references for each of
these items:

1. PROVIDER NETWORK
The provider network will be evaluated and scored with reference to the
Offeror's network development and network management. Network development is
defined as the process of developing contractual arrangements with a sufficient
number of providers capable of delivering all covered services to AHCCCS members
in accordance with AHCCCSA standards (e. g., appointment times). AHCCCSA will
use contracts and/ or completed Letters of Intent with other required materials
to evaluate and score network development. A signed Letter of Intent will
receive the same weight and consideration as a signed contract. The Offeror's
network will be evaluated by service and by site in each GSA bid by the Offeror.
The Offeror should note that Attachment B of this solicitation identifies
minimum geographic standards for a provider network.

				-93-
<page>

Network management is defined as the process by which the Offeror certifies,
monitors, evaluates and communicates with its network. AHCCCSA anticipates
evaluating and scoring the Offeror's submitted materials relative to the
following areas:

a. Monitoring and management of network
b. Network communication
c. Capacity analysis, planning and development

2. CAPITATION
The Offeror shall submit initial capitation bids by risk group within a GSA.
These initial bids will be evaluated and scored. The lowest bid within each
GSA and risk group will receive the maximum allowable points. If a bid
is below the actuarial rate range, the bid will be evaluated as if it were at
the bottom of the actuarial rate range. No additional points will be given for
bids below the actuarial rate range. Conversely, the highest bid (within or
above the actuarial rate range) will receive the least number of points.

If AHCCCSA requests best and final offers, these offers will be scored using
the same methodology as was used to score the initial bids. The initial bid
will be weighted 60% and the final bid 40%.

Offerors should note that AHCCCSA may not offer the opportunity to submit best
and final offers.

3. PROGRAM

1. CONTENTS OF OFFEROR'S PROPOSAL
All proposals (original and seven copies) shall be organized with strict
adherence to the Offeror's Checklist (Attachment K), as described in this
section and submitted using the forms and specifications provided in this
RFP. All pages of the Offeror's proposal must be numbered sequentially with
documents placed in sturdy 3-inch, 3-ring binders. All responses shall be in
10 point font or larger with borders no less than 1/2". Unless otherwise
specified, responses to each submission requirement should be limited to three
81/2" x 11" one sided, single spaced, type written pages. Erasures,
interlineations or other modifications in the proposal must be initialed in
original ink by the authorized person signing the offer. A policy, brochure, or
reference to a policy or manual does not constitute an adequate response.
AHCCCSA will not reimburse the Offeror the cost of proposal preparation.

It is the responsibility of the Offeror to examine the entire RFP, seek
clarification of any requirement that may not be clear, and check all
responses for accuracy before submitting its proposal. The proposal becomes a
part of the contract; thus, what is stated in the proposal may be evaluated
either during the proposal evaluation process or during other reviews.
Proposals may not be withdrawn after the published due date and time.

All proposals will become the property of AHCCCSA. The Offeror may designate
certain information to be proprietary in nature by typing the word
"proprietary" on top of every page for which nondisclosure is requested.
Final determinations of nondisclosure, however, rest with the AHCCCSA Director.
Regardless of such determinations, all portions of the Offeror's proposal,
even pages that are proprietary, will be provided to CMS and its evaluation
contractor.

All proposals shall be organized according to the following major categories:

I.   General Matters
II.  Provider Network
III. Capitation
IV.  Program
V.   Organization
VI.  Extra Credit

Each section shall be separated by a divider and contain all information
requested in this solicitation. Numbering of pages should continue in sequence
through each separate section. For example, "Provider Network" would
begin with the page number following the last page number in "General
Matters". Each section shall begin with a table of contents.

Proposals that are not submitted in conformance with the guidelines described
herein will not be considered. References to various sections of the RFP
document in Section I and Section K are intended to be of assistance
and are not intended to represent all requirements. Other possible resources
may be found in the Bidder's Library.

All responses incorporating examples of past performance and/ or outcome data
must comply with the following requirements:

*  Incumbents must submit based on their AHCCCS acute care line of business
*  New Offerors currently operating as Managed Care Organizations (MCO), must
   submit all historical information from the same MCO/ line of business

III. Capitation
Capitation is a fixed (per member) monthly payment to contractors for the
provision of covered services to members. It is an actuarially sound amount to
cover expected utilization and costs for the individual risk groups
in a risk-sharing managed care environment. The Offeror must demonstrate that
the capitation rates proposed are actuarially sound. In general terms, this
means that the Offeror who is awarded a contract should be able to keep
utilization at or near its proposed levels and that it will be able to contract
for unit costs that average at or near the amounts shown on the Capitation
Rates Calculation Sheet (CRCS). This requirement also applies to bids
submitted in best and final offer rounds.

Prior Period Coverage (PPC) and HIV/ AIDS Supplement rates will be set by
AHCCCS' actuaries and not bid by the Contractor. Due to the lack of complete
historical data, the Title XIX Waiver Group and HIFA Parents' rates
will also be set by AHCCCS' actuaries, rather than bid by the Contractor. See
Section D, Paragraph 53, Compensation, for information regarding risk sharing
for the Title XIX Waiver Group and PPC time period. All other rate codes,
including the Delivery Supplemental Payment, will be subject to competitive
bidding.

To facilitate the preparation of its capitation proposals, AHCCCSA will provide
each Offeror with a Data Supplement. This data source should not be used as the
sole source of information in making decisions concerning the capitation
proposal. Each Offeror is solely responsible for research, preparation and
documentation of its capitation proposal.

Required Submission: Capitation

10. The Offeror must submit its capitation proposal using the AHCCCSA bid web
site. Instructions for accessing and using the web site will be issued by
March 1, 2003. The Offeror must have an actuary who is a member of the
American Academy of Actuaries certify that the bid submission is actuarially
sound. This certification must be done with subsequent submissions in Best and
Final Offer rounds (if applicable). The Offeror must also submit hard copy
print outs of the web site CRCS. Refer to Section B and Attachment E for
more details.

The Offeror must prepare and submit its capitation proposal assuming a $35,000
deductible level for regular reinsurance, for all rate codes, in all counties.
AHCCCSA will provide a table of per member per month reinsurance adjustments
to be made to capitation rates for those Contractors whose actual
deductible level exceeds $35,000.

Capitation rates shall be submitted two ways: first, assuming all medical
services are included in the capitation rates, and second, assuming that
prescription drugs will be carved out of the capitation rates.
Prescription drugs are defined as "FDA approved legend or over the counter (OTC)
products provided upon receipt of a valid prescription order and dispensed by
a pharmacist in an outpatient setting."
When bidding with prescription drugs carved out, please factor the impact to
the other medical service and administrative categories. AHCCCSA anticipates
that in the event that prescription drugs are carved

				-99-

out, the entity with which AHCCCSA contracts will provide real time
prescription drug data to the health plans in a standard National Council for
Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) format The Offeror is
expected to continue an integrated approach, including the use of prescriptive
data, in the management of the member's care.

The Offeror's rate proposal will be deemed by AHCCCSA to include the costs of
administrative adjustments required during the term of this contract.

will assume no prior familiarity with the AHCCCS program. From 10: 00 a. m.
to 12: 30 p. m., there will be a Prospective Offerors' conference for all
new and continuing offerors. The purpose of this conference is to clarify the
contents of this solicitation and to avoid any misunderstandings regarding
AHCCCSA requirements. Any doubt as to the contents and requirements
of this solicitation or any apparent omission or discrepancy should be
presented at this conference. AHCCCSA will then determine the action necessary
and issue a written amendment to the solicitation, if appropriate.

Also on February 21, 2003, from 2: 00 p. m. until 5: 00 p. m., a Technical
Interface meeting will be held. The purpose of this meeting is to orient

Contracts and Purchasing.

7. ON-SITE REVIEW
Prior to contract award, all Offerors may be subject to on-site review(s)
to determine that an infrastructure is in place that will support the
provision of services to the acute population within the GSAs bid.

8. BEST AND FINAL OFFERS
AHCCCSA reserves the right to accept any or all initial offers without further
negotiation and may choose not to request a best and final offer (BFO).
Offerors are therefore advised to submit their most competitive offers at the
outset. However, if it is considered in the best interest of the State, AHCCCSA
may issue a written request to all offerors for a best and final offer in a
particular geographic service area or areas. The purpose of a BFO request is
to allow offerors an opportunity to resubmit bids for rate codes not previously
accepted by AHCCCSA. This request will notify them of the date, time and
place for the submission of their offers. In addition, AHCCCSA will disclose
to each offeror which of its bid rates are acceptable (within or below
actuarial rate range), and which are not acceptable (above the actuarial
rate range). All offerors whose final bid rates fall below the bottom of the
actuarial rate range will have their rates increased to the bottom of that
rate range after the final BFO. If an offeror does not submit a notice of
withdrawal or a best and final offer, its immediate previous offer will be
considered its best and final offer.

All BFOs must be submitted via the AHCCCS website, as well as in accordance
with Section B of the RFP.
AHCCCSA will limit the number of BFO rounds if it is in the best interest of
the State. Offerors will be

				-105-
<page>

permitted, within the restrictions and limitations defined below, to adjust
upward, a capitation rate for a rate code that was previously accepted to
offset the reduction of a capitation rate in another rate code in the first BFO
round only. These restrictions and limitations include, but are not limited to:

a. An offeror will be allowed to adjust upward a previously accepted rate code
   bid only during the first BFO round;

b. The weighted amount of BFO increase cannot exceed the weighted amount of
   BFO reduction. AHCCCSA will furnish the Offeror, in the Data Supplement, the
   enrollment percentages, by rate code, by GSA, to be used in determining the
   weighted amount. Should the weighted amount of the adjustment exceed the
   weighted amount of the BFO reduction, AHCCCSA shall reject the first BFO and
   the adjustment (costing the Offeror the loss of the first BFO round in that
   GSA). Since a rate code can only be adjusted during the first BFO round, the
   Offeror will lose the opportunity to make an upward capitation adjustment to
   previously accepted rate code bids in that GSA. For example, assume that SSI
   w/o Medicare was the rate code where a BFO was needed and the offeror reduced
   this rate by $10 PMPM. Also assume the SSI w/o Medicare rate code accounted
   for 9% of the members in the GSA.

   Weighted Average Capitation Reduction -9% X $10.00 = $. 90

   Assume the rate code adjusted upward was TANF and this rate code was
   increased by $2.00 PMPM.    Also assume this rate code accounted for 50% of
   the members in the GSA.

   Weighted Average Capitation Increase -50% X $2.00 = $1.00

   Therefore, the BFO would be rejected because the weighted amount of the BFO
   adjustment exceeded the weighted amount of the BFO reduction.

c. Offerors will not be allowed to decrease a bid in a BFO round if the initial
   bid was below the bottom of the rate range. If such a BFO is submitted it
   will be rejected.

d. If an adjustment during the initial BFO round causes the Offeror to exceed
   the upper range of any rate code, AHCCCSA will reject the adjustment and
   return the (adjusted) rate code to the initial capitation rate bid by the
   Offeror. Since a previously accepted rate code bid can only be adjusted
   during the first BFO round, the Offeror will lose the opportunity to make an
   upward capitation adjustment for this rate code.

e. AHCCCSA reserves the sole right to accept or reject any adjustment. The
   Offeror by submitting an adjustment to a rate code is requesting approval by
   AHCCCSA; such approval shall not be automatic. If an initial bid is below the
   bottom of a rate range, it cannot be adjusted downward by the Offeror in a
   BFO round.

Capitation Rates Offered after the BFOs: As stated above, AHCCCSA may limit the
number of BFO rounds. After the final BFO round is complete, provided it is
in the best interest of the State, AHCCCSA will cease issuing BFO requests. At
this point, should the Offeror have a rate code( s) without an accepted
capitation rate, AHCCCSA shall offer a capitation rate to the Offeror. The
capitation rate offered should be somewhere in the bottom half of the rate
range (specific placement to be determined by AHCCCSA and its actuaries). Note
that all rates offered in this manner shall be identical for all offerors in
the same GSA and rate code.

9. AWARD OF CONTRACT
AHCCCSA has determined that the provision of covered services to eligible
populations in the Geographic Service Areas as described below will stabilize
risk sharing. The Offeror must therefore bid on at least one entire
GSA in order to be considered for a contract award. Although AHCCCSA encourages
Offerors to bid on multiple GSAs, AHCCCSA may limit the number of GSA's awarded
to any one offeror, if deemed in the best interest of the State.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this solicitation, AHCCCSA expressly
reserves the right to:

a. Waive any immaterial mistake or informality;
b. Reject any or all proposals, or portions thereof; and/or
c. Reissue a Request for Proposal

If two plans or their parents merge after obtaining contract awards, AHCCCSA
retains the right to address each merger issue on an individual basis according
to what is deemed in the best interest of the State.

If there are significant compliance issues with a current plan or a plan's
contract in a particular county has been previously terminated, AHCCCSA
retains the right to address each compliance or termination issue on an
individual basis according to what is deemed in the best interest of the State.
A new bid proposal may not be accepted until it has been determined that the
reason for the significant compliance or termination issue has been
resolved and there is a reasonable assurance that it will not recur.

A response to this Request for Proposals is an offer to contract with AHCCCSA
based upon the terms, conditions, scope of work and specifications of the RFP.
All of the terms and conditions of the contract are contained in this
solicitation, solicitation amendments and subsequent contract amendments,
if any, signed by the Contracting Officer. Proposals do not become contracts
unless and until they are accepted by the Contracting Officer. A
contract is formed when the AHCCCSA Contracting Officer signs the award page
and provides written notice of the award( s) to the successful offeror( s),
and the Offeror accepts any special provisions to the contract and the
final rates awarded. AHCCCSA may also, at its sole option, modify any
requirements described herein. All offerors will be promptly notified of award.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to specify and/ or modify the number of contracts to
be awarded in any GSA. AHCCCSA anticipates awarding contracts as follows:

GSA #: 		County or Counties 			Number of Awards:
================================================================================
2 		Yuma, La Paz 				Maximum of 2
4 		Apache, Coconino, Mohave, and Navajo 	Maximum of 2
6 		Yavapai 				Maximum of 2
8 		Gila, Pinal 				Maximum of 2
10 		Pima, Santa Cruz* 			Maximum of 5
12 		Maricopa 				Maximum of 6
14 		Graham, Greenlee, Cochise 		Maximum of 2

Note: *AHCCCS anticipates awarding up to five contracts in the Pima County
portion of the Pima/ Santa Cruz GSA. Contracts will be awarded to two of
the five Pima contract awardees in Santa Cruz.

An existing contractor in Maricopa or Pima County who is not awarded a new
contract may request to have its enrollment capped and to continue providing
services under the terms and condition of this new RFP.
AHCCCSA may, at its sole option, grant or deny such a request. If AHCCCSA
approves such an enrollment cap,

				-107-
<page>

the Contractor would continue to serve its existing members but would not
receive any new members. The enrollment cap will not be lifted during the
term of this or any subsequent contract period unless one of the
following conditions exist:

a. Another contractor is terminated and increased member capacity is needed, or
b. Legislative action creates a sudden and substantial increase in the overall
   AHCCCS population, or
c. Extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances make such an action necessary and
   in the best interest of the State.

If an existing contractor is not awarded a new or capped (as mentioned above)
contract, an open enrollment will be held, as described in Section D,
Paragraph 5 of this document. The costs of this open enrollment shall be
shared by each of the Contractors within the pertinent GSA and AHCCCSA.

Subsequent to the award of contracts, in the event of significant non-compliance
issues with a Contractor in a particular GSA, AHCCCSA may refer back to the
results of the evaluation of this solicitation and select another
Contractor for a particular GSA that is considered to be in the best interest
of the State.

Finally, successful bidders should be prepared to submit sample subcontracts
for approval as soon as possible after the contract award. AHCCCSA will
expedite the approval process.

10. FEDERAL DEADLINE FOR SIGNING CONTRACT
The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has imposed strict
deadlines for finalization of contracts in order to qualify for federal
financial participation. This contract, and all subsequent amendments, must be
completed and signed by both parties, and must be available for submission to
CMS prior to the beginning date for the contract term (October 1, 2003). All
public entity Offerors must ensure that the approval of this contract is
placed on appropriate agendas well in advance to ensure compliance with this
deadline. Any withholding of federal funds caused by the Offeror's failure
to comply with this requirement shall be borne in full by the Offeror.

To comply with these requirements, AHCCCSA requires all clinical laboratories
to provide verification of CLIA Licensure or Certificate of Waiver during the
provider registration process. Failure to do so shall result in either a
termination of an active provider ID number or denial of initial registration.
These requirements apply to all clinical laboratories.

Pass-through billing or other similar activities with the intent of avoiding
the above requirements are prohibited. The Contractor may not reimburse
providers who do not comply with the above requirements. (CLIA of 1988;
42 CFR 493, Subpart A)

ATTACHMENT B: MINIMUM NETWORK STANDARDS
Minimum Network Standards
(By Geographic Service Area)


INSTRUCTIONS:
Contractors shall have in place an adequate network of providers capable of
meeting contract requirements. The information that follows describes the
minimum network requirements by Geographic Service Area (GSA).
In some GSAs there are required service sites located outside of the
geographical boundary of a GSA. The reason for this relates to practical
access to care. In certain instances, a member must travel a much greater
distance to receive services within their assigned GSA, if the member were
not allowed to receive services in an adjoining GSA or state.

Split zip codes occur in some counties. Split zip codes are those which
straddle two different counties. Enrollment for members residing in these
zip codes is based upon the county and GSA to which the entire zip
code has been assigned by AHCCCS. The Contractor shall be responsible for
providing services to members residing in the entire zip code that is
assigned to the GSA for which the Contractor has agreed to provide services.
The split zip codes GSA assignments are as follows:

</TABLE>

If outpatient specialty services (OB, family planning, internal medicine and
pediatrics) are not included in the primary care provider contract, at least
one subcontract is required for each of these specialties in the service sites
specified.

In Tucson (GSA 10) and Metropolitan Phoenix (GSA 12), the Contractor must
demonstrate its ability to provide PCP, dental and pharmacy services so that
members do not have to travel more than 5 miles from their residence.
Metropolitan Phoenix is defined on the Minimum Network Standard page specific
to GSA # 12.

				-115-
<page>

At a minimum, the Contractor shall have a physician with admitting and treatment
privileges with each hospital in its network. Contractors in GSA 10 and/or
GSA 12 must contract with physicians with admitting privileges in at least
one hospital in each service district (see specific GSA requirements). Should
the Hospital Reimbursement Pilot Program be renewed as discussed in Section D,
Paragraph 40, Hospital Subcontracting and Reimbursement, the Contractor shall
contract with at least one hospital in each service district.

Provider categories required at various service delivery sites included in the
Service Area Minimum Network Standards are indicated as follows:

H  Hospitals
P  Primary Care Providers (physicians, certified nurse practitioners and
   physician assistants)
D  Dentists
Ph Pharmacies

ATTACHMENT E: INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING CAPITATION PROPOSAL

All capitation rate bid proposals (including and best and final offers, if
applicable) must be submitted to AHCCCSA via the AHCCCS Web Based Capitation
Rate Proposal application. A Capitation Rate Calculation Sheet (CRCS) must
be completed for every risk group in each Geographic Service Area (GSA) in
which the Offeror bids.

The Offeror must also use the Web application to print and submit Section B,
Capitation Rates, of the Request for Proposal (RFP). In the event that the
Web application bid submission differs from the bid submission included
with Section B of the RFP, the bid submitted via the Web application will
prevail. The first page of Section B should be the certification that the
capitation rates are actuarially sound by an actuary who is a member of the
American Academy of Actuaries.

The Web application will present the CRCS bid screens by:

a. Pharmacy expenditures included and without pharmacy expenditures
b. Geographic Service Area (GSA), and
c. Risk Group

The following is a list of the seven GSAs and the fifteen counties associated
to each GSA that will be effective 10/1/03.

6 	Yavapai
8 	Gila, Pinal
10 	Pima, Santa Cruz
12 	Maricopa
14 	Graham, Greenlee, Cochise

The following is a listing of the nine risk groups for which capitation rates
need to be bid. All nine risk groups apply to each GSA.

ATTACHMENT G: AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM

Members who do not have the right to choose a Contractor or members who have
the right to choose but do not exercise this right, are assigned to a
Contractor through an auto-assignment algorithm. The algorithm is a
mathematical formula used to distribute members to the various Contractors in
a manner that is predictable and consistent with AHCCCSA goals.

The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case may
be a member or a household of members) to Contractors using the target
percentages developed. The algorithm data table consists of all the
geographic service areas (GSA) in the state, all Contractors serving each GSA,
and the target percentages by risk group within each GSA.

The Contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a GSA and risk
group, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case for that GSA.
The equation used is:

				(t/T) - P = d

t = The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, for the
    Contractor
T = The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, all
    Contractors combined
P = The target percentage of members per risk group for the Contractor
d = The difference

The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference for
each Contractor. When more than one Contractor has the same difference, and
their differences are greater than all other Contractors, the Contractor
with the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.

Assignment by the algorithm applies to:

1. Members that are newly eligible to the AHCCCS program that did not choose a
   Contractor within the prescribed time limits.

2. Members whose assigned health plan is no longer available after the member
   moves to a new GSA and did not choose a new Contractor within the prescribed
   time limits.

3. Members whose assigned plan is no longer available at the beginning of a
   contract cycle that did not choose a Contractor within the prescribed time
   limits.

All Contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each risk
group, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members
accordingly. A Contractor with a more favorable target percentage in the
algorithm will receive proportionally more members. Conversely, a Contractor
with a lower target percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally
fewer members. The algorithm favors Contractors with both lower final
bids and awarded rates. The algorithm also favors those Contractors with
programs that score higher based on AHCCCSA's evaluation criteria.

For Contractors in the Maricopa and Pima/Santa Cruz GSAs with fewer than
25,000 members statewide, a temporary adjustment will be made to the algorithm
formula in order to ensure a minimum membership (see the discussion entitled
"Adjustment Methodology for Contractors with Fewer than 25,000 Members" for
more information).

Development of the Target Percentages

For the first year of the contract, the algorithm target percentages will be
developed using the methodology described below. However, for subsequent
years, AHCCCS reserves the right to change the algorithm methodology to
assure assignments are made in the best interest of the AHCCCS program and
the State.

A Contractor's placement in the algorithm is based upon the following three
factors, which are weighted as follows:

Adjustment Methodology for Contractors with Fewer than 25,000 Members

At the beginning of the new contract cycle, the auto-assignment algorithm for
the Maricopa and Pima/Santa Cruz GSAs will be adjusted to favor Contractors
with fewer than 25,000 members statewide. The adjusted algorithm
will be utilized until a target membership of 25,000 members statewide, per
Contractor, is reached.

The adjustment will be made to the final percentages developed using the
methodology above. A pre-determined percentage, based on the table below,
will be added to the affected Contractor(s) and subtracted evenly from the
other Contractors.

*In the event that there are more than three affected Contractors, AHCCCS
will disclose adjustment methodology by July 1, 2003.

In the event that a Contractor only receives an award in rural GSAs, AHCCCS
reserves the right to make a temporary adjustment to the auto-assignment target
to favor the new Contractor until a minimum enrollment is reached.

AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust capitation rates for potential changes to
the populations risk due to the adjusted algorithm.

   provider and member grievances

e. Within five working days of receipt, the Complainant is informed by letter
   that the grievance has been received.

f. Each grievance is thoroughly investigated using the applicable statutory,
   regulatory, contractual and policy provisions, ensuring that facts are
   obtained from all parties.

g. All documentation received and mailed by the Contractor during the grievance
   process is dated upon receipt.

h. All grievances are filed in a secure designated area and are retained for
   five years following the Contractor's decision, the Administration's
   decision, judicial appeal or close of the grievance, whichever is later.

i. A copy of the Contractor's decision will be either hand-delivered or

1. written request of the Complainant asking for the request for hearing
2. copies of the entire file which includes the investigations and/or medical
   records; and the Contractor's decision
3. other information relevant to the resolution of the grievance

				-162-
<page>

ATTACHMENT I: ENCOUNTER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor will be assessed sanctions for noncompliance with encounter
submission requirements. AHCCCSA may also perform special reviews of encounter
data, such as comparing encounter reports to the Contractor's claims files.
Any findings of incomplete or inaccurate encounter data may result in the
imposition of sanctions or requirement of a corrective action plan.

Pended Encounter Corrections

The Contractor must resolve all pended encounters within 120 days of the
original processing date. Sanctions will be imposed according to the
following schedule for each encounter pended for more than 120 days unless
the pend is due to AHCCCSA error:

0-120 days   121-180 days  181-240 days   241-360 days   361 + days
No sanction  $ 5 per month $ 10 per month $ 15 per month $ 20 per month

"AHCCCSA error" is defined as a pended encounter, which (1) AHCCCSA
acknowledges to be the result of its own error, and (2) requires a change
to the system programming, an update to the database reference table,
or further research by AHCCCSA. AHCCCSA reserves the right to adjust the
sanction amount if circumstances warrant.

When the Contractor notifies AHCCCSA, in writing, that the resolution of a
pended encounter depends on AHCCCSA rather than the Contractor, AHCCCSA will
respond in writing within 30 days of receipt of such notification. The
AHCCCSA response will report the status of each pending encounter problem or
issue in question.

Pended encounters will not qualify as AHCCCSA errors if AHCCCSA reviews the
Contractor's notification and asks the Contractor to research the issue and
provide additional substantiating documentation, or if AHCCCSA disagrees with
the Contractor's claim of AHCCCSA error. If a pended encounter being
researched by AHCCCSA is later determined not to be caused by AHCCCSA error,
the Contractor may be sanctioned retroactively.

Before imposing sanctions, AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor, in writing, of
the total number of sanctionable encounters pended more than 120 days. Pended
encounters shall not be deleted by the Contractor as a means of avoiding
sanctions for failure to correct encounters within 120 days. The Contractor
shall document deleted encounters and shall maintain a record of the deleted
CRNs with appropriate reasons indicated. The Contractor shall, upon
request, make this documentation available to AHCCCSA for review.

Encounter Validation Studies

Per CMS requirement, AHCCCSA will conduct encounter validation studies of
the Contractor's encounter submissions, and sanction the Contractor for
noncompliance with encounter submission requirements. The purpose of encounter
validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a
medical record or other source with the Contractor's submitted encounter data.
Any and all covered services may be validated as part of these studies.
Encounter validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.

AHCCCSA may revise study methodology, timelines, and sanction amounts based on
agency review or as a result of consultations with CMS. The Contractor will
be notified in writing of any significant change in study methodology.

				-163-
<page>

AHCCCSA will conduct two encounter validation studies. Study "A" examines
non-institutional services (form HCFA 1500 encounters), and Study "B"
examines institutional services (form UB-92 encounters).

AHCCCSA will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of
the selected data needed for encounter validation studies. The Contractor will
have 90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCSA. In the case of medical
records requests, the Contractor's failure to provide AHCCCSA with the records
requested within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing
medical record. If AHCCCSA does not receive a sufficient number of medical
records from the Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a
study, the Contractor may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation
payment.

The criteria used in encounter validation studies may include timeliness,
correctness, and omission of encounters. These criteria are defined as follows:

Timeliness: The time elapsed between the date of service and the date that the
encounter is received at AHCCCS. All encounters must be received by AHCCCSA
no later than 240 days after the end of the month in which the service was
rendered, or the effective date of enrollment with the Contractor, whichever
is later. For all encounters for which timeliness is evaluated, a sanction
per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be
assessed if the encounter record is received by AHCCCSA more than 240
days after the date determined above. It is anticipated that the sanction
amount will be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters;
however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines that
encounter quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements. The
Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the studies
at the time the studies begin.

Correctness: A correct encounter contains a complete and accurate description
of AHCCCS covered services provided to a member. A sanction per encounter
error extrapolated to the population of encounters may be assessed if the
encounter is incomplete or incorrectly coded. It is anticipated that the
sanction amount will be $1.00 per error extrapolated to the population of
encounters; however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA determines
that encounter quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction requirements.
The Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in effect for the
studies at the time the studies begin.

Omission of data: An encounter not submitted to AHCCCSA or an encounter
inappropriately deleted from AHCCCSA's pending encounter file or historical
files in lieu of correction of such record. For Study "A" and for Study "B",
a sanction per encounter error extrapolated to the population of encounters
may be assessed for an omission. It is anticipated that the sanction amount
will be $5.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters for
Study "A" and $10.00 per error extrapolated to the population of encounters
for Study "B"; however, sanction amounts may be adjusted if AHCCCSA
determines that encounter quality has changed, or if CMS changes sanction
requirements. The Contractor will be notified of the sanction amount in effect
for the studies at the time the studies begin.

For encounter validation studies, AHCCCSA will select all approved and pended
encounters to be studied no earlier than 240 days after the end of the
month in which the service was rendered. Once AHCCCSA has selected the
Contractor's encounters for encounter validation studies, subsequent
encounter submissions for the period being studied will not be considered.

AHCCCSA may review all of the Contractor's submitted encounters, or may select
a sample. The sample size, or number of encounters to be reviewed, will be
determined using statistical methods in order to accurately
estimate the Contractor's error rates. Error rates will be calculated by
dividing the number of errors found by the number of encounters reviewed.
A 95% confidence interval will be used to account for limitations caused
by sampling. The confidence interval shows the range within which the true
error rate is estimated to be. If error rates are based on a sample, the
error rate used for sanction purposes will be the lower limit of the
confidence interval.

				-164-
<page>

Encounter validation methodology and statistical formulas are provided in the
AHCCCS Encounter Data Validation Technical Document, which is available in the
Bidders Library. This document also provides examples, which illustrate how
AHCCCSA determines study sample sizes, error rates, confidence intervals,
and sanction amounts.

Written preliminary results of all encounter validation studies will be sent
to the Contractor for review and comment. The Contractor will have a maximum
of 30 days to review results and provide AHCCCSA with additional documentation
that would affect the final calculation of error rates and sanctions. AHCCCSA
will examine the Contractor's documentation and may revise study results if
warranted. Written final results of the study will then be sent to the
Contractor and communicated to CMS, and any sanctions will be assessed.

The Contractor may file a written challenge to sanctions assessed by AHCCCSA
not more than 35 days after the Contractor receives final study results from
AHCCCSA. Challenges will be reviewed by AHCCCSA and a written decision will
be rendered no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of a timely
challenge. Sanctions shall not apply to encounter errors successfully
challenged. A challenge must be filed on a timely basis and a decision must
be rendered by AHCCCSA prior to filing a grievance and request for hearing
pursuant to Article 8 of AHCCCS Rules. Sanction amounts will be deducted
from the Contractor's capitation payment.

Encounter Corrections

Contractors are required to submit replacement or voided encounters in the
event that claims are subsequently corrected following the initial encounter
submission. This includes corrections as a result of inaccuracies
identified by fraud and abuse audits or investigations conducted by AHCCCSA
or the Contractor. Contractors shall refer to the Encounter Reporting User
Manual for instructions regarding submission of corrected encounters.
