                  2.1      REVOLVING LOANS.

                  (a)      Revolving Commitment. Subject to the terms and
         conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and
         warranties set forth herein, each Lender severally agrees to make
         available to the Borrower such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage
         of revolving credit loans requested by the Borrower in Dollars
         ("Revolving Loans") from time to time from the Closing Date until the
         Maturity Date, or such earlier date as the Revolving Commitments shall

         FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($25,000,000.00) (as such aggregate maximum amount
         may be reduced from time to time as provided in Section 3.4, the

                                       29

         in Letters of Credit or LOC Obligations plus its Participation
         Interests in Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender's Revolving
         Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount. Revolving
         Loans may consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a

         that no more than 6 Eurodollar Loans which are Revolving Loans shall be

         existing Interest Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a
         single Interest Period). Revolving Loans hereunder may be repaid and
         reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

                  (b)      Revolving Loan Borrowings.

                           (i)      Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall
                  request a Revolving Loan borrowing by written notice (or
                  telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the Agent
                  not later than 11:00 A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on
                  the date of the requested borrowing in the case of Base Rate
                  Loans, and on the third Business Day prior to the date of the
                  requested borrowing in the case of Eurodollar Loans. Each such
                  request for borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify
                  (A) that a Revolving Loan is requested, (B) the date of the
                  requested borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the

                  borrowing shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar
                  Loans or a combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are
                  requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower
                  shall fail to specify in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an
                  applicable Interest Period in the case of a Eurodollar Loan,
                  then such notice shall be deemed to be a request for an
                  Interest Period of one month, or (II) the type of Revolving
                  Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
                  request for a Base Rate Loan hereunder. The Agent shall give
                  notice to each affected Lender promptly upon receipt of each
                  Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the
                  contents thereof and each such Lender's share of any borrowing
                  to be made pursuant thereto.

                  Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of
                  $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in excess thereof
                  (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed Amount, if
                  less).

                           (iii)    Advances. Except for Revolving Loans made
                  for the purpose of reimbursing the Issuing Lender in respect
                  of a drawing under a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section
                  2.4(e) or Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.2(d), each
                  Lender will make its Revolving Commitment Percentage of each
                  Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Agent for the
                  account of the Borrower as specified in


                                       30

                  specify in writing, by 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina
                  time) on the date specified in the applicable Notice of
                  Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately available to the
                  Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to the
                  Borrower by the Agent by crediting the account of the Borrower
                  on the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts
                  made available to the Agent by the Lenders and in like funds
                  as received by the Agent.

                  (c)      Repayment. The Borrower hereby promises to pay the
         principal amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans in full on the
         Maturity Date, unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

                  (d)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,

                           (i)      Base Rate Loans. During such periods as
                  Revolving Loans shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base
                  Rate Loans, such Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per
                  annum rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate.

                           (ii)     Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as

         arrears on each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other
         times as may be specified herein).

         Borrower, in Dollars, at any time and from time to time, during the
         period from and including the Effective Date to but not including the
         Maturity Date (or such earlier date if the Commitments have been
         terminated as provided herein); provided that (i) the aggregate
         principal amount of the Swing Line Loans outstanding at any one time
         shall not exceed the Swing Line Committed Amount and (ii) the aggregate
         amount of outstanding Swing Line Loans plus the aggregate amount of
         outstanding Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations shall not exceed the
         lesser of (A) the Revolving Committed Amount and (B) the Borrowing
         Base. Subject to the terms of this Loan Agreement, the Borrower may

<PAGE>

         the Swing Line Lender, followed promptly by a written Swing Line Loan
         Request in the form of Exhibit 2.2(b) (which maybe submitted by
         telecopy) setting forth (i) the amount of the requested Swing Line Loan
         and (ii) the date of the requested Swing Line Loan and complying in all
         respects with Section 5.2. The Swing Line Lender shall initiate the
         transfer of funds representing the Swing Line Loan advance to the
         Borrower by 3:00 p.m. on the Business Day of the requested borrowing.

                  (c)      Minimum Amounts. Each Swing Line Loan shall be in a
         minimum amount of the lesser of $100,000 (and in integral multiples of
         $25,000 in excess thereof) or the remaining amount available under the
         Swing Line Committed Amount.

                  (d)      Repayment and Participations of Swing Line Loans. The
         Swing Line Loans shall bear interest at a rate mutually agreeable to
         the Swing Line Lender and the Borrower at the time of the borrowing of
         such Swing Line Loan, but in no event shall such rate exceed the
         Adjusted Base Rate. The Borrower agrees to repay all Swing Line Loans
         immediately upon the existence of a Default or Event of Default or
         otherwise within three Business Days of demand therefor by the Swing
         Line Lender. If the Borrower does not immediately notify the Swing Line
         Lender that the Borrower intends to otherwise repay such Swing Line
         Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Loan
         advance comprised solely of Base Rate Loans in the amount of such Swing
         Line Loans; provided, however, that any such demand shall be deemed to
         have been given one Business Day prior to the Maturity Date and on the
         date of the occurrence of any Event of Default described in Section 9.1
         and upon acceleration of the indebtedness hereunder and the exercise of
         remedies in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2. Each Lender
         hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro rata share of each such
         Revolving Loan in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified
         in the preceding sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of such
         borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for advances of
         Revolving Loans otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any
         conditions specified in Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a
         Default or an Event of Default then exists, (iv) failure of any such
         request or deemed request for a Revolving Loan to be made by the time
         otherwise required hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is
         a date on which Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made
         hereunder or (vi) any termination of the Commitments relating thereto
         immediately prior to or contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the
         event that any Revolving Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date
         otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of
         the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect
         to the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each Lender hereby
         agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such borrowing
         would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received
         from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase)
         from the Swing Line Lender such Participation Interests in the
         outstanding Swing Line Loans as shall be necessary to cause each such
         Lender to share in such Swing Line Loans ratably based upon its
         Revolving Commitment Percentage of the Revolving Committed Amount
         (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
         pursuant to Section 3.4), provided that (A) all interest payable on the
         Swing Line Loans shall be for the account of the Swing Line Lender
         until the date as of which the respective Participation Interest is
         purchased and (B) at the time any purchase of Participation Interests
         pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall
         be required to pay to the Swing Line Lender, interest on the principal
         amount of Participation Interests purchased for each day from the date
         of demand

         thereof, at a rate equal to, if paid within two Business Days of such
         date, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the
         Base Rate plus two percent (2%) per annum.

                  (e)      Swing Line Loan Note. The Swing Line Loans made by
         the Swing Line Lender shall be evidenced by a duly executed promissory
         note of the Borrower to the Swing Line Lender in substantially the form
         of Exhibit 2.2(e).

                  2.3      TERM LOAN.

                  (a)      Term Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions
         hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set
         forth herein each Lender severally agrees to make available to the
         Borrower on the Closing Date such Lender's Term Loan Percentage of a
         term loan in Dollars (the "Term Loan"; each component thereof may be
         referred to herein as a "Term Loan") in the aggregate principal amount
         of SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ($60,000,000.00) (the "Term Loan Committed
         Amount"). The Term Loan may consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar
         Loans, or a combination thereof, as the Borrower may request; provided,
         however, that no more than 6 Eurodollar Loans which are Term Loans
         shall be outstanding hereunder at any time (it being understood that,
         for purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods
         shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on
         the same date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in
         accordance with the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of
         existing Interest Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a
         single Interest Period). Amounts repaid on the Term Loan may not be
         reborrowed.

                  (b)      Borrowing Procedures. The Borrower shall submit an
         appropriate Notice of Borrowing to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M.
         (Charlotte, North Carolina time) or such later time as the Agent and
         the Borrower shall agree on the Closing Date, with respect to the
         portion of the Term Loan initially consisting of a Base Rate Loan, or
         on the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, with respect to
         the portion of the Term Loan initially consisting of one or more
         Eurodollar Loans. Such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and
         shall specify (i) that the funding of a Term Loan is requested and (ii)
         whether the funding of the Term Loan shall be comprised of Base Rate
         Loans, Eurodollar Loans or a combination thereof, and if Eurodollar
         Loans are requested, the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower
         shall fail to deliver such Notice of Borrowing to the Agent by 11:00
         A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the third Business Day prior
         to the Closing Date, then the full amount of the Term Loan shall be
         disbursed on the Closing Date as a Base Rate Loan. Each Lender shall
         make its Term Loan Percentage of the Term Loan available to the Agent
         for the account of the Borrower at the office of the Agent specified in
         Schedule 2.1(a), or at such other office as the Agent may designate in
         writing, by 1:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Closing
         Date in Dollars and in funds immediately available to the Agent.

                  (c)      Minimum Amounts. Each Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate
         Loan that is part of the Term Loan shall be in an aggregate principal
         amount that is not less than $1,000,000 and integral multiples of
         $100,000 (or the then remaining principal balance of the Term Loan, if
         less).


                                       33

                  (d)      Repayment of Term Loan. The Borrower hereby promises
         to pay the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan in full on the
         Maturity Date.

                  (e)      Interest. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,
         the Term Loan shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to:

                           (i)      Base Rate Loans. During such periods as the
                  Term Loan shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate
                  Loans, such Base Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum
                  rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate.

                           (ii)     Eurodollar Loans. During such periods as the
                  Term Loan shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar
                  Loans, such Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per
                  annum rate equal to the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

         The Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on the Term Loan in
         arrears on each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other
         times as may be specified herein).

                  (f)      Term Notes. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the
         request to the Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and
         deliver to such Lender a promissory note evidencing the Term Loans of
         such Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.3(f), with
         appropriate insertions as to date and principal amount (a "Term Note").

                  2.4      LETTER OF CREDIT SUBFACILITY.

                  (a)      Issuance. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof
         and in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth
         herein, the Issuing Lender agrees to issue, and each Lender severally
         agrees to participate in the issuance by the Issuing Lender of, standby
         and trade Letters of Credit in Dollars from time to time from the
         Closing Date until the date thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date
         as the Borrower may request, in a form acceptable to the Issuing
         Lender; provided, however, that (i) the LOC Obligations outstanding
         shall not at any time exceed TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
         ($2,500,000) (the "LOC Committed Amount") and (ii) the sum of the
         aggregate outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC
         Obligations plus Swing Line Loans outstanding shall not at any time
         exceed the lesser of (A) the Revolving Committed Amount and (B) the
         Borrowing Base. No Letter of Credit shall (x) have an original expiry
         date more than one year from the date of issuance (provided that any
         such Letter of Credit may contain customary "evergreen" provisions
         pursuant to which the expiry date is automatically extended by a
         specific time period unless the Issuing Lender gives notice to the
         beneficiary of such Letter of Credit at least a specified time period
         prior to the expiry date then in effect) or (y) as originally issued or
         as extended, have an expiry date extending beyond the date thirty (30)
         days prior to the Maturity Date. Each Letter of Credit shall comply
         with the related LOC Documents. The issuance and expiry dates of each
         Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day.

                  (b)      Notice and Reports. The request for the issuance of a
         Letter of Credit shall be submitted by the Borrower to the Issuing
         Lender at least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date of
         issuance. The Issuing Lender will, at least quarterly and more


                                       34
<PAGE>

         frequently upon request, disseminate to each of the Lenders a detailed
         report specifying the Letters of Credit which are then issued and
         outstanding and any activity with respect thereto which may have
         occurred since the date of the prior report, and including therein,
         among other things, the beneficiary, the face amount and the expiry
         date, as well as any payment or expirations which may have occurred.

                  (c)      Participation. Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter
         of Credit, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a
         Participation Interest from the Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit
         and the obligations arising thereunder and any collateral relating
         thereto, in each case in an amount equal to its pro rata share of the
         obligations under such Letter of Credit (based on the respective
         Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders) and shall absolutely,
         unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be obligated to pay to the
         Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata share of the
         obligations arising under such Letter of Credit. Without limiting the
         scope and nature of each Lender's Participation Interest in any Letter
         of Credit, to the extent that the Issuing Lender has not been
         reimbursed as required hereunder or under any such Letter of Credit,
         each such Lender shall pay to the Issuing Lender its pro rata share of
         such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the day of notification
         by the Issuing Lender of an unreimbursed drawing pursuant to the
         provisions of subsection (d) below. The obligation of each Lender to so
         reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be absolute and unconditional and
         shall not be affected by the occurrence of a Default, an Event of
         Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement shall
         not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to
         reimburse the Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit, together with
         interest as hereinafter provided.

                  (d)      Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any
         Letter of Credit, the Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower.
         Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify the Issuing Lender that
         the Borrower intends to otherwise reimburse the Issuing Lender for such
         drawing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that the
         Lenders make a Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing as provided
         in subsection (e) below on the related Letter of Credit, the proceeds
         of which will be used to satisfy the related reimbursement obligations.
         The Borrower promises to reimburse the Issuing Lender on the day of
         drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a
         Revolving Loan obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds. If
         the Borrower shall fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender as provided
         hereinabove, the Borrower promises to pay the Issuing Lender interest
         on the unreimbursed amount of such drawing on demand at a per annum
         rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%. The Borrower's
         reimbursement obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
         under all circumstances irrespective of any rights of setoff,
         counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower may claim or have
         against the Issuing Lender, the Agent, the Lenders, the beneficiary of
         the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including without
         limitation any defense based on any failure of the Borrower or any
         other Credit Party to receive consideration or the legality, validity,
         regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The Issuing
         Lender will promptly notify the other Lenders of the amount of any
         unreimbursed drawing and each Lender shall promptly pay to the Agent
         for the account of the Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately
         available funds, the amount of such Lender's pro rata share of such
         unreimbursed drawing. Such payment shall be made on the day such notice
         is received by such Lender from the Issuing Lender if such notice is
         received at or before 2:00 P.M.


                                       35
<PAGE>

         (Charlotte, North Carolina time), and otherwise such payment shall be
         made at or before 12:00 Noon (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the
         Business Day next succeeding the day such notice is received. If such
         Lender does not pay such amount to the Issuing Lender in full upon such
         request, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Agent for the account
         of the Issuing Lender interest on the unpaid amount during the period
         from the date of such drawing until such Lender pays such amount to the
         Issuing Lender in full at a rate per annum equal to, if paid within two
         (2) Business Days of the date that such Lender is required to make
         payments of such amount pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Federal
         Funds Rate and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate. Each
         Lender's obligation to make such payment to the Issuing Lender, and the
         right of the Issuing Lender to receive the same, shall be absolute and
         unconditional, shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever and
         without regard to the termination of this Loan Agreement or the
         Commitments hereunder, the existence of a Default or Event of Default
         or the acceleration of the obligations of the Borrower hereunder and
         shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
         whatsoever. Simultaneously with the making of each such payment by a
         Lender to the Issuing Lender, such Lender shall, automatically and
         without any further action on the part of the Issuing Lender or such
         Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an amount equal to such
         payment (excluding the portion of such payment constituting interest
         owing to the Issuing Lender) in the related unreimbursed drawing
         portion of the LOC Obligation and in the interest thereon and in the
         related LOC Documents, and shall have a claim against the Borrower with
         respect thereto.

                  (e)      Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which
         the Borrower shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a
         Revolving Loan advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit,
         the Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has
         been requested or deemed requested by the Borrower to be made in
         connection with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case a
         Revolving Loan advance comprised of Base Rate Loans (or Eurodollar
         Loans to the extent the Borrower has complied with the procedures of
         Section 2.1(b)(i) with respect thereto) shall be immediately made to
         the Borrower by all Lenders (notwithstanding any termination of the
         Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) pro rata based on the respective
         Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before
         giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section
         9.2) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to the Issuing
         Lender for application to the respective LOC Obligations. Each such
         Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro rata share of each
         such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such request or deemed request
         in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in the preceding
         sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of such borrowing may not
         comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans
         otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in
         Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of
         Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed
         request for Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required
         hereunder, (v) whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which
         Revolving Loans are otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi)
         any termination of the Commitments relating thereto immediately prior
         to or contemporaneously with such borrowing. In the event that any
         Revolving Loan cannot for any reason be made on the date otherwise
         required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the
         commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to
         the Borrower or any other Credit Party), then each such Lender hereby
         agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of the date such borrowing
         would


                                       36
<PAGE>

         otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from
         the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the
         Issuing Lender such Participation Interests in the outstanding LOC
         Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each such Lender to share in
         such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the respective Revolving
         Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before giving effect
         to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2)),
         provided that at the time any purchase of Participation Interests
         pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall
         be required to pay to the Issuing Lender, to the extent not paid to the
         Issuing Lender by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of
         subsection (d) above, interest on the principal amount of Participation
         Interests purchased for each day from and including the day upon which
         such borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date
         of payment for such Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if
         paid within two (2) Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan
         advance, the Federal Funds Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the
         Base Rate.

                  (f)      Designation of Consolidated Parties as Account
         Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
         Loan Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.4(a), a Letter
         of Credit issued hereunder may contain a statement to the effect that
         such Letter of Credit is issued for the account of any Subsidiary of
         the Borrower, provided that notwithstanding such statement, the
         Borrower shall be the actual account party for all purposes of this
         Loan Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement shall not
         affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect
         to such Letter of Credit.

                  (g)      Renewal, Extension. The renewal or extension of any
         Letter of Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects
         the same as the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

                  (h)      Uniform Customs and Practices. The Issuing Lender may
         have the Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and
         Practice for Documentary Credits (the "UCP") or the International
         Standby Practices 1998 (the "ISP98"), in either case as published as of
         the date of issue by the International Chamber of Commerce, in which
         case the UCP or the ISP98, as applicable, may be incorporated therein
         and deemed in all respects to be a part thereof.

                  (i)      Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.

                           (i)      In addition to its other obligations under
                  this Section 2.4, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and
                  protect, indemnify and save each Lender harmless from and
                  against, any and all claims, demands, liabilities, damages,
                  losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) that such Lender may incur or be subject to
                  as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the issuance of
                  any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender to
                  honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any
                  act or omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present
                  or future de jure or de facto government or Governmental
                  Authority (all such acts or omissions, herein called
                  "Government Acts").


                                       37

                           (ii)     As between the Borrower and the Lenders
                  (including the Issuing Lender), the Borrower shall assume all
                  risks of the acts, omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit
                  by the beneficiary thereof. No Lender (including the Issuing
                  Lender) shall be responsible: (A) for the form, validity,
                  sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any
                  document submitted by any party in connection with the
                  application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if
                  it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
                  insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the
                  validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or
                  assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of
                  Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
                  thereof, in whole or in part, that may prove to be invalid or
                  ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors, omissions,
                  interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
                  messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise,
                  whether or not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in
                  the transmission or otherwise of any document required in
                  order to make a drawing under a Letter of Credit or of the
                  proceeds thereof; and (E) for any consequences arising from
                  causes beyond the control of such Lender, including, without
                  limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above shall
                  affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of the Issuing Lender's
                  rights or powers hereunder.

                           (iii)    In furtherance and extension and not in
                  limitation of the specific provisions hereinabove set forth,
                  any action taken or omitted by any Lender (including the
                  Issuing Lender), under or in connection with any Letter of
                  Credit or the related certificates, if taken or omitted in
                  good faith, shall not put such Lender under any resulting
                  liability to the Borrower or any other Credit Party. It is the
                  intention of the parties that this Loan Agreement shall be
                  construed and applied to protect and indemnify each Lender
                  (including the Issuing Lender) against any and all risks
                  involved in the issuance of the Letters of Credit, all of
                  which risks are hereby assumed by the Borrower (on behalf of
                  itself and each of the other Credit Parties), including,
                  without limitation, any and all Government Acts. No Lender
                  (including the Issuing Lender) shall, in any way, be liable
                  for any failure by such Lender or anyone else to pay any
                  drawing under any Letter of Credit as a result of any
                  Government Acts or any other cause beyond the control of such
                  Lender.

                           (iv)     Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended
                  to limit the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower
                  contained in subsection (d) above. The obligations of the
                  Borrower under this subsection (i) shall survive the
                  termination of this Loan Agreement. No act or omission of any
                  current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in
                  any way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders (including
                  the Issuing Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit
                  under this Loan Agreement.

                           (v)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
                  contained in this subsection (i), the Borrower shall have no
                  obligation to indemnify any Lender (including the Issuing
                  Lender) in respect of any liability incurred by such Lender
                  (A) arising solely out of the gross negligence or willful
                  misconduct of such Lender, as determined by a court of
                  competent jurisdiction, or (B) caused by such Lender's failure
                  to pay under any Letter of Credit after presentation to it of
                  a request strictly complying with the terms and conditions of
                  such Letter of Credit, as determined by a


                                       38
<PAGE>

                  court of competent jurisdiction, unless such payment is
                  prohibited by any law, regulation, court order or decree.

                  (j)      Responsibility of Issuing Lender. It is expressly
         understood and agreed that the obligations of the Issuing Lender
         hereunder to the Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this
         Loan Agreement and that the Issuing Lender shall be entitled to assume
         that the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.2 have been
         satisfied unless it shall have acquired actual knowledge that any such
         condition precedent has not been satisfied; provided, however, that
         nothing set forth in this Section 2.4 shall be deemed to prejudice the
         right of any Lender to recover from the Issuing Lender any amounts made
         available by such Lender to the Issuing Lender pursuant to this Section
         2.4 in the event that it is determined by a court of competent
         jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter of Credit
         constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
         Issuing Lender.

                  (k)      Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any
         conflict between this Loan Agreement and any LOC Document (including
         any letter of credit application), this Loan Agreement shall control.


                                    SECTION 3

                 OTHER PROVISIONS RELATING TO CREDIT FACILITIES

                  3.1      DEFAULT RATE.

         Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of
Default, (i) the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on
the Loans and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents shall at the discretion of the Required Lenders (or automatically if
the Event of Default is pursuant to Section 9.1(f)) bear interest, payable on
demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the rate which would otherwise be
applicable (or if no rate is applicable, whether in respect of interest, fees or
other amounts, then the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%) and (ii) the Standby Letter
of Credit Fee and the Trade Letter of Credit Fee shall accrue at a per annum
rate 2% greater than the rate which would otherwise be applicable.

                  3.2      EXTENSION AND CONVERSION.

         The Borrower shall have the option, on any Business Day, to extend
existing Loans into a subsequent permissible Interest Period or to convert Loans
into Loans of another interest rate type; provided, however, that (i) except as
provided in Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans
or extended as Eurodollar Loans for new Interest Periods only on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Loans extended as, or converted
into, Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to the terms of the definition of
"Interest Period" set forth in Section 1.1 and shall be in such minimum amounts
as provided in, with respect to Revolving Loans, Section 2.1(b)(ii) with respect
to Swing Line Loans, Section 2.2(c) or with respect to the Term Loan, Section
2.3(c) (iii) no more than 6 Eurodollar Loans which are Revolving Loans and 6
Eurodollar Loans which are Term Loans shall be outstanding hereunder at any time
(it being understood that, for purposes hereof, Eurodollar Loans with different
Interest Periods shall be considered as separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they
begin on the same date, although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in


                                       39
<PAGE>

accordance with the provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing
Interest Periods to constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest
Period) and (iv) any request for extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan
which shall fail to specify an Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request
for an Interest Period of one month. Each such extension or conversion shall be
effected by the Borrower by giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) to the office of the Agent
specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at such other office as the Agent may designate
in writing, prior to 11:00 A.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the Business
Day of, in the case of the conversion of a Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate
Loan, and on the third Business Day prior to, in the case of the extension of a
Eurodollar Loan as, or conversion of a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan,
the date of the proposed extension or conversion, specifying the date of the
proposed extension or conversion, the Loans to be so extended or converted, the
types of Loans into which such Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate,
the applicable Interest Periods with respect thereto. In the event the Borrower
fails to request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan in accordance
with this Section 3.2, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or
required by this Section 3.2, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically
converted into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto. The Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of
any such proposed extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

                  3.3      PREPAYMENTS.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. The Borrower shall have the
         right to prepay Loans in whole or in part from time to time; provided,
         however, that each partial prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum
         principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in
         excess thereof and subject to the foregoing terms, amounts prepaid
         under this Section 3.3(a) shall be applied as the Borrower may elect;
         provided that if the Borrower shall fail to specify with respect to any
         voluntary prepayment, such voluntary prepayment shall be applied first
         pro rata to Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans then to the Term Loan,
         in each case first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in
         direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this
         Section 3.3(a) shall be subject to Section 3.12, but otherwise without
         premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on the
         principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

                  (b)      Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i)      (A)      Revolving Committed Amount. If at any time,
                           the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount
                           of Revolving Loans plus the aggregate outstanding
                           principal amount of Swing Line Loans plus LOC
                           Obligations shall exceed the lesser of (A) the
                           Revolving Committed Amount and (B) the Borrowing
                           Base, the Borrower, within two (2) Business Days,
                           shall prepay the Revolving Loans and (after all
                           Revolving Loans have been repaid) cash collateralize
                           the LOC Obligations, in an amount sufficient to
                           eliminate such excess.

                           (B)      LOC Committed Amount. If at any time, the
                           sum of the aggregate principal amount of LOC
                           Obligations shall exceed the LOC Committed Amount,
                           the Borrower immediately shall cash collateralize the
                           LOC Obligations in an amount sufficient to eliminate
                           such excess.

                  (ii)     (A)      Asset Dispositions. Immediately upon the
                           occurrence of any Asset Disposition Prepayment Event,
                           the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an aggregate
                           amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of the
                           related Asset Disposition not applied (or caused to
                           be applied) by the Credit Parties during the related
                           Application Period to make Eligible Reinvestments as
                           contemplated by the terms of Section 8.5(f) (such
                           prepayment to be applied as set forth in clause (vi)
                           below).

                           (B)      Involuntary Dispositions. Immediately upon
                           the occurrence of an Involuntary Disposition
                           Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
                           in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Excess
                           Proceeds (such prepayment to be applied as set forth
                           in clause (vi) below).

                  (iii)    Debt Issuances. Promptly, but in any event within two
                  (2) Business Days, upon the occurrence of a Debt Issuance
                  Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans in
                  an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of
                  the related Debt Issuance (such prepayment to be applied as
                  set forth in clause (vi) below).

                  (iv)     Equity Issuances. Promptly, but in any event within
                  two (2) Business Days, upon the occurrence of an Equity
                  Issuance Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall prepay the Term
                  Loans in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash
                  Proceeds of the related Equity Issuance (such prepayment to be
                  applied as set forth in clause (vi) below).

                  (v)      Excess Royalties. At any time that the aggregate
                  amount of the outstanding Term Loans is greater that
                  $35,000,000, the Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans in an
                  aggregate amount equal to 50% of the Excess Royalties for such
                  fiscal quarter most recently ended (such prepayments to be
                  made within 30 days of the receipt of such royalty payments
                  (provided that the Borrower may accumulate and pay in one
                  payment such amounts received during the first 75 days after
                  the end of each fiscal quarter related to the prior quarter)
                  and such payments to be applied as set forth in clause (vi)
                  below).

                  (vi)     Application of Mandatory Prepayments. All amounts
                  required to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3(b) shall be
                  applied as follows: (A) with respect to all amounts prepaid
                  pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)(A), pro rata to Revolving Loans
                  and Swing Line Loans and (after all Revolving Loans and Swing
                  Line Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral account in
                  respect of LOC Obligations (B) with respect to all amounts
                  prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)(B), to a cash collateral
                  account in respect of LOC Obligations, (C) with respect to all
                  amounts prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(ii), first to the
                  Term Loan, and, after the Term Loan is paid in full, to the
                  Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans (with, if an Event of
                  Default has occurred, a corresponding reduction in the
                  Revolving Committed Amount) and (D) with respect to all
                  amounts prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(iii), (iv) or (v),
                  to the Term Loan. Within the parameters of the applications
                  set forth above, prepayments shall be applied first to Base
                  Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans


                                       41
<PAGE>

                  in direct order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments
                  under this Section 3.3(b) shall be subject to Section 3.12,
                  but otherwise without premium or penalty, and shall be
                  accompanied by interest on the principal amount prepaid
                  through the date of prepayment.

                  (vii)    Prepayment Account. If the Borrower is required to
                  make a mandatory prepayment of Eurodollar Loans under this
                  Section 3.3(b), the Borrower shall have the right, in lieu of
                  making such prepayment in full, to deposit an amount equal to
                  such mandatory prepayment with the Agent in a cash collateral
                  account maintained (pursuant to documentation reasonably
                  satisfactory to the Agent) by and in the sole dominion and
                  control of the Agent. Any amounts so deposited shall be held
                  by the Agent as collateral for the prepayment of such
                  Eurodollar Loans and shall be applied to the prepayment of the
                  applicable Eurodollar Loans at the end of the current Interest
                  Periods applicable thereto. At the request of the Borrower,
                  amounts so deposited shall be invested by the Agent in Cash
                  Equivalents maturing prior to the date or dates on which it is
                  anticipated that such amounts will be applied to prepay such
                  Eurodollar Loans; any interest earned on such Cash Equivalents
                  will be for the account of the Borrower and the Borrower will
                  deposit with the Agent the amount of any loss on any such Cash
                  Equivalents to the extent necessary in order that the amount
                  of the prepayment to be made with the deposited amounts shall
                  not be reduced.

                  3.4      TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF REVOLVING COMMITTED
AMOUNT.

                  (a)      Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower may from time to
         time permanently reduce or terminate the Revolving Committed Amount in
         whole or in part (in minimum aggregate amounts of $1,000,000 or in
         integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the
         full remaining amount of the then applicable Revolving Committed
         Amount)) upon five Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent;
         provided, however, no such termination or reduction shall be made which
         would cause the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
         Revolving Loans plus the aggregate amount of outstanding Swing Line
         Loans plus LOC Obligations to exceed the lesser of (A) the Revolving
         Committed Amount and (B) the Borrowing Base, unless, concurrently with
         such termination or reduction, the Revolving Loans are repaid to the
         extent necessary to eliminate such excess. The Agent shall promptly
         notify each affected Lender of receipt by the Agent of any notice from
         the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).

                  (b)      Term Loan Commitments. The Term Loan Commitment of
         each Lender, if any, shall automatically terminate at such time as such
         Lender shall have made available to the Borrower such Lender's share of
         the Term Loan.

                  (c)      Mandatory Reductions. The Revolving Committed Amount
         automatically shall be permanently reduced from time to time in
         accordance with the terms of Section 3.3(b)(v).

                  (d)      Maturity Date. Unless terminated sooner pursuant to
         Section 3.4(a) or Section 9.2, the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders
         and the LOC Commitment of the


                                       42
<PAGE>

         Issuing Lender shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date (as
         such Maturity Date may be extended pursuant to the terms of Section
         12.2).

                  (e)      General. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
         account of the Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section 3.5(a),
         on the date of each termination or reduction of the Revolving Committed
         Amount, the Unused Fee accrued through the date of such termination or
         reduction on the amount of the Revolving Committed Amount so terminated
         or reduced.

                  3.5      FEES.

                  (a)      Unused Fee. In consideration of the Revolving
         Commitments of the Lenders hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to
         the Agent for the account of each Lender a fee (the "Unused Fee") on
         the Unused Revolving Committed Amount computed at a per annum rate for
         each day during the applicable Unused Fee Calculation Period
         (hereinafter defined) at a rate equal to the Applicable Percentage in
         effect from time to time. The Unused Fee shall commence to accrue on
         July 12, 2001 and shall be due and payable in arrears on the Closing
         Date and, thereafter, on the last Business Day of each March, June,
         September and December (and on any date that the Revolving Committed
         Amount is reduced and on the Maturity Date) for the immediately
         preceding quarter (or portion thereof) (each such quarter or portion
         thereof for which the Unused Fee is payable hereunder being herein
         referred to as an "Unused Fee Calculation Period"), beginning with the
         first of such dates to occur after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
         the foregoing, the Unused Fee due and payable on the Closing Date shall
         be, with respect to the period from July 12, 2001 to the Closing Date,
         net of the equivalent fee the Borrower is paying under the Existing
         Loan Agreement.

                  (b)      Agent's Fees. The Borrower promises to pay to the
         Agent, for its own account and for the account of Banc of America
         Securities LLC, as applicable, the fees referred to in the BAMC Fee
         Letter.

                  (c)      Letter of Credit Fees.

                           (i)      Standby Letter of Credit Issuance Fee. In
                  consideration of the issuance of standby Letters of Credit
                  hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the
                  account of each Lender a fee (the "Standby Letter of Credit
                  Fee") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the
                  average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under each
                  such standby Letter of Credit computed at a per annum rate for
                  each day from the date of issuance to the date of expiration
                  equal to the Applicable Percentage. The Standby Letter of
                  Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last
                  Business Day of each March, June, September and December for
                  the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof).

                           (ii)     Trade Letter of Credit Drawing Fee. In
                  consideration of the issuance of trade Letters of Credit
                  hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the
                  account of each Lender a fee (the "Trade Letter of Credit
                  Fee") on such Lender's Revolving Commitment Percentage of the
                  average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under each
                  such trade Letter of Credit computed at


                                       43
<PAGE>

                  a per annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the
                  date of expiration equal to the Applicable Percentage. The
                  Trade Letter of Credit Fee will be payable quarterly in
                  arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
                  September and December for the immediately preceding quarter
                  (or a portion thereof).

                           (iii)    Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the
                  Standby Letter of Credit Fee payable pursuant to clause (i)
                  above and the Trade Letter of Credit Fee payable pursuant to
                  clause (ii) above, the Borrower promises to pay to the Agent
                  for the account of the Issuing Lender without sharing by the
                  other Lenders (i) a letter of credit fronting fee of 0.125% on
                  the average daily maximum amount available to be drawn under
                  each Letter of Credit computed at a per annum rate for each
                  day from the date of issuance to the date of expiration (which
                  fronting fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last
                  Business Day of each March, June, September and December for
                  the immediately preceding quarter (or a portion thereof)) and
                  (ii) the customary charges from time to time of the Issuing
                  Lender with respect to the issuance, amendment, transfer,
                  administration, cancellation and conversion of, and drawings
                  under, such Letters of Credit.

                  3.6      CAPITAL ADEQUACY.

         If any Lender has reasonably determined, after the date hereof, that
the adoption or the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by
any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof in the interpretation or administration
of, any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or
compliance by such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or
obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have
achieved but for such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then,
within thirty (30) days of notice from such Lender to the Borrower (such notice
to include reasonable detail as to such change), the Borrower shall be obligated
to pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for such reduction; provided that the Borrower shall not be obligated to
reimburse any Lender for such increase or reduction for any period ninety (90)
days prior to such Lender providing notice if such Lender was aware of the
circumstances that existed which would cause such increase or reduction during
such ninety (90) day prior-period. Each determination by any such Lender of
amounts owing under this Section shall if made in good faith, absent manifest
error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

                  3.7      LIMITATION ON EURODOLLAR LOANS.

         If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Loan:

                  (a)      the Agent determines (which determination if made in
         good faith shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that by reason of
         circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and reasonable
         means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such
         Interest Period; or


                                       44
<PAGE>

                  (b)      the Required Lenders determine (which determination
         if made in good faith shall be conclusive absent manifest error) and
         notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will not adequately and
         fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Eurodollar Loans for
         such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to
make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either
prepay such Eurodollar Loans or Convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Loan Agreement.

                  3.8      ILLEGALITY.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Loan Agreement, in the
event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office
to make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lender's obligation to make or
Continue Eurodollar Loans and to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and
fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable).

                  3.9      REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.

                  (a)      If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any
         applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any change in any applicable
         law, rule, or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
         administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank, or
         comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration
         thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office)
         with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
         of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

                           (i)      shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable
                  Lending Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect
                  to any Eurodollar Loans, its Notes, or its obligation to make
                  Eurodollar Loans, or change the basis of taxation of any
                  amounts payable to such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
                  Office) under this Loan Agreement or its Notes in respect of
                  any Eurodollar Loans (other than taxes imposed on the overall
                  net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such
                  Lender has its principal office or such Applicable Lending
                  Office);

                           (ii)     shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any
                  reserve, special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement
                  (other than the Eurodollar Reserve Percentage utilized in the
                  determination of the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate) relating to any
                  extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with
                  or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender (or its
                  Applicable Lending Office), including the Commitment of such
                  Lender hereunder; or

                           (iii)    shall impose on such Lender (or its
                  Applicable Lending Office) or the London interbank market any
                  other condition affecting this Loan Agreement or its Notes or
                  any of such extensions of credit or liabilities or
                  commitments;


                                       45
<PAGE>

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, Converting into, Continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Loan Agreement or its
Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to such
Lender within thirty (30) days of notice from such Lender to the Borrower (such
notice to include reasonable detail as to such change) such amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender
requests compensation by the Borrower under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may,
by notice to such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), suspend the obligation of
such Lender to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans
into Eurodollar Loans, until the event or condition giving rise to such request
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable); provided that such suspension shall not affect the right of such
Lender to receive the compensation so requested. Each Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge,
occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation
pursuant to this Section 3.9 and will designate a different Applicable Lending
Office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to it. Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3.9
shall furnish to the Borrower and the Agent a statement setting forth the
additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be
conclusive, if made in good faith, in the absence of manifest error. In
determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods.

                  (b)      The Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
         Lender pursuant to this Section 3.9 for any increased costs or
         reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such
         Lender notifies the Borrower of the change of law giving rise to such
         increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim
         compensation therefor; provided that, if the change of law giving rise
         to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then such 90-day
         period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
         retroactive effect thereof.

                  3.10     TREATMENT OF AFFECTED LOANS.

         If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s)
of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the
case of a Conversion, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the
Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives
notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or
3.9 hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

                  (a)      to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans
         have been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that
         would otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be
         applied instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

                  (b)      all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued
         by such Lender as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued instead
         as Base Rate Loans, and all Base Rate Loans of such Lender that would
         otherwise be Converted into Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate
         Loans.


                                       46
<PAGE>

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to the
Conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 3.10 no
longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances
ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are
outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by such Lender are
held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest
Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

                  3.11     TAXES.

                  (a)      Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for
         the account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any other
         Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for
         any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
         deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect
         thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes
         imposed on its income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, (i) by the
         jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender (or its Applicable
         Lending Office) or the Agent (as the case may be) is organized or any
         political subdivision thereof or (ii) by reason of any present or
         former connection between the Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction
         of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any political
         subdivision thereof, other than such a connection arising solely from
         the Agent or such Lender having executed, delivered or performed its
         obligations or received a payment under, or enforced this Loan
         Agreement or the Notes (all such non-excluded taxes, duties, levies,
         imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings, and liabilities being
         hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit Party shall be
         required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum
         payable under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document to any
         Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
         necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
         deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
         3.11) such Lender or the Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it
         would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit
         Party shall make such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the
         full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other
         authority in accordance with applicable law, and (iv) such Credit Party
         shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 11.1,
         the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment
         thereof.

                  (b)      In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all
         present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
         property taxes or charges or similar levies which arise from any
         payment made under this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document or
         from the execution or delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this
         Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as
         "Other Taxes").

                  (c)      The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the
         Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
         limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any
         jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.11) paid by such
         Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
         penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
         thereto. This indemnification shall be made


                                       47
<PAGE>

         within thirty (30) days from the date the Agent or such Lender, or the
         case may be, makes written demand therefor.

                  (d)      Each Lender that is not a United States person under
         Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, on or prior to the date of its
         execution and delivery of this Loan Agreement in the case of each
         Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date
         on which it becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from
         time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Borrower or the
         Agent (but only so long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so),
         shall provide the Borrower and the Agent with (i) Internal Revenue
         Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI, as appropriate, or any successor form
         prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Lender
         is entitled to benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United
         States is a party which reduces to zero the rate of withholding tax on
         payments of interest or certifying that the income receivable pursuant
         to this Loan Agreement is effectively connected with the conduct of a
         trade or business in the United States, (ii) Internal Revenue Service
         Form W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by
         the Internal Revenue Service, and/or (iii) any other form or
         certificate required by any taxing authority (including any certificate
         required by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code),
         certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from tax on
         payments pursuant to this Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan
         Documents.

                  (e)      For any period with respect to which a Lender has
         failed to provide the Borrower and the Agent with the appropriate form
         pursuant to Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in
         treaty, law, or regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a
         form originally was required to be provided), such Lender shall not be
         entitled to indemnification under Section 3.11(a) or 3.11(b) with
         respect to Taxes imposed by the United States; provided, however, that
         should a Lender, which is otherwise exempt from withholding tax, become
         subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form required
         hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall
         reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

                  (f)      If any Credit Party is required to pay additional
         amounts to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section
         3.11, then such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change
         the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or
         reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such
         change, in the judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Lender.

                  (g)      Without prejudice to the survival of any other
         agreement of the Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and
         obligations of the Credit Parties contained in this Section 3.11 shall
         survive the repayment of the Loans, the LOC Obligations and other
         obligations under the Loan Documents and the termination of the
         Commitments hereunder.

                  3.12     COMPENSATION.

         Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Agent) from time to time,
the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender
harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:


                                       48
<PAGE>

                  (a)      any Continuation, Conversion, payment or prepayment
         of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last
         day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory,
         automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (b)      any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than
         the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, Continue
         or Convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the
         amount notified by the Borrower; or

                  (c)      any assignment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day other
         than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a
         request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 3.17;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.12, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Loan made by it at the Interbank Offered Rate for such Loan by a matching
deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore Dollar interbank market
for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Loan was in fact so funded. The covenants of the Borrower set forth
in this Section 3.12 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, the LOC
Obligations and other obligations under the Loan Documents and the termination
of the Commitments hereunder.

                  3.13     PRO RATA TREATMENT.

         Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

                  (a)      Loans. Each Loan (other than Swing Line Loans), each
         payment or (subject to the terms of Section 3.3) prepayment of
         principal of any Loan (other than Swing Line Loans) or reimbursement
         obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment
         of interest on the Loans (other than Swing Line Loans) or reimbursement
         obligations arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment
         of Unused Fees, each payment of the Standby Letter of Credit Fee, each
         payment of the Trade Letter of Credit Fee, each reduction of the
         Revolving Committed Amount and each conversion or extension of any Loan
         (other than Swing Line Loans), shall be allocated pro rata among the
         Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their
         outstanding Loans of the applicable type and Participation Interests in
         Loans of the applicable type and Letters of Credit.

                  (b)      Swing Line Loans. The Swing Line Lender shall
         receive, for its own account, all payments or prepayments of principal
         and interest with respect to the Swing Line Loans; provided, however,
         upon the funding of the Participants' participation interests with
         respect to a Swing Line Loan pursuant to Section 2.2(d), such
         Participants shall be entitled to receive their pro rata share of any
         payment or prepayment of principal and interest with respect to such
         Swing Line Loan.

                  (c)      Advances.

                           (i)      No Lender shall be responsible for the
                  failure or delay by any other Lender in its obligation to make
                  its ratable share of a borrowing hereunder; provided, however,
                  that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its obligations
                  hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its
                  obligations hereunder.

                           (ii)     Unless the Borrower or any Lender has
                  notified the Agent prior to the date any payment is required
                  to be made by it to the Agent hereunder, that the Borrower or
                  such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment,
                  the Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the
                  case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall
                  not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a
                  corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto. If and to
                  the extent that such payment was not in fact made to the Agent
                  in immediately available funds, then:

                                    (A)      if the Borrower failed to make such
                                    payment, each Lender shall forthwith on
                                    demand repay to the Agent the portion of
                                    such assumed payment that was made available
                                    to such Lender in immediately available
                                    funds, together with interest thereon in
                                    respect of each day from and including the
                                    date such amount was made available by the
                                    Agent to such Lender to the date such amount
                                    is repaid to the Agent in immediately
                                    available funds, at the Federal Funds Rate
                                    from time to time in effect; and

                                    (B)      if any Lender failed to make such
                                    payment, such Lender shall forthwith on
                                    demand pay to the Agent the amount thereof
                                    in immediately available funds, together
                                    with interest thereon for the period from
                                    the date such amount was made available by
                                    the Agent to the Borrower to the date such
                                    amount is recovered by the Agent (the
                                    "Compensation Period") at a rate per annum
                                    equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
                                    time in effect. If such Lender does not pay
                                    such amount forthwith upon the Agent's
                                    demand therefor, the Agent may make a demand
                                    therefor upon the Borrower, and the Borrower
                                    shall pay such amount to the Agent, together
                                    with interest thereon for the Compensation
                                    Period at a rate per annum equal to the rate
                                    of interest applicable to the applicable
                                    Borrowing.

                  Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
         obligation to fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights that
         the Agent or the Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of
         any default by such Lender hereunder. A notice of the Agent to any
         Lender with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall
         be conclusive, absent manifest error.

                  3.14     SHARING OF PAYMENTS.

         The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender
shall obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other
obligation owing to such Lender under this Loan Agreement through the exercise
of a right of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured
claim under Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such
Lender under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or
otherwise, or by any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such
payment as provided for in this Loan Agreement, such Lender shall promptly
purchase from the other Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC
Obligations and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders
share such payment in accordance with their respective ratable shares as
provided for in this Loan Agreement. The Lenders further agree among themselves
that if payment to a Lender obtained by such Lender through the exercise of a
right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or other event as aforesaid shall
be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each Lender which shall have shared
the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase of a Participation Interest
theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit (together with its share of
any accrued interest payable with respect thereto) to each Lender whose payment
shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The Borrower agrees that any
Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest may, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including setoff, banker's
lien or counterclaim, with respect to such Participation Interest as fully as if
such Lender were a holder of such Loan, LOC Obligations or other obligation in
the amount of such Participation Interest. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Loan Agreement, if any Lender shall fail to remit to the Agent
or any other Lender an amount payable by such Lender to the Agent or such other
Lender pursuant to this Loan Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such
payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from the
date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Agent or such
other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a
secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies, such
Lender shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such
secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this
Section 3.14 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

                  3.15     PAYMENTS, COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      Generally. Except as otherwise specifically provided
         herein, all payments hereunder shall be made to the Agent in Dollars in
         immediately available funds, without condition or deduction for any
         counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff of any kind, at the Agent's
         office specified in Schedule 2.1(a) not later than 2:00 P.M.
         (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on the date when due. Payments
         received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the
         next succeeding Business Day. The Agent may (but shall not be obligated
         to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time
         to any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower or any other Credit
         Party maintained with the Agent (with notice to the Borrower or such
         other Credit Party). The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any
         payment under this Loan Agreement, specify to the Agent the Loans, LOC
         Obligations, Fees, interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower
         hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that
         it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent
         with the terms hereof, the Agent shall distribute such


                                       51
<PAGE>

         payment to the Lenders in such manner as the Agent may determine to be
         appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the Borrower hereunder,
         subject to the terms of Section 3.13(a)). The Agent will distribute
         such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is received prior to
         2:00 P.M. (Charlotte, North Carolina time) on a Business Day in like
         funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and otherwise
         the Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders on the next
         succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated
         to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof
         shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to
         accrual of interest and Fees for the period of such extension), except
         that in the case of Eurodollar Loans, if the extension would cause the
         payment to be made in the next following calendar month, then such
         payment shall instead be made on the next preceding Business Day.
         Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all computations of
         interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual number of days
         elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to computation of
         interest on Base Rate Loans and Swing Line Loans which shall be
         calculated based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. Interest
         shall accrue from and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the
         date of payment.

                  (b)      Allocation of Payments After Acceleration.
         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Loan Agreement to the
         contrary, after acceleration of the Credit Party Obligations pursuant
         to Section 9.2, all amounts collected or received by the Agent or any
         Lender on account of the Credit Party Obligations or any other amounts
         outstanding under any of the Loan Documents or in respect of the
         Collateral shall be paid over or delivered as follows:

                           FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of the Agent in connection with enforcing the
                  rights of the Lenders under the Loan Documents and any
                  protective advances made by the Agent with respect to the
                  Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the Collateral
                  Documents;

                           SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent or
                  the Swing Line Lender;

                           THIRD, to the payment of all of the Credit Party
                  Obligations consisting of accrued fees and interest;

                           FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal
                  amount of the Credit Party Obligations (including the cash
                  collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations);

                           FIFTH, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket
                  costs and expenses (including without limitation, reasonable
                  attorneys' fees) of each of the Lenders in connection with
                  enforcing its rights under the Loan Documents or otherwise
                  with respect to the Credit Party Obligations owing to such
                  Lender;


                                       52
<PAGE>

                           SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and
                  other obligations which shall have become due and payable
                  under the Loan Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant
                  to clauses "FIRST" through "FIFTH" above; and

                           SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to
                  whomever may be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

         In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in
         the numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to
         the next succeeding category, (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an
         amount equal to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the
         then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to
         the aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts
         available to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH"
         and "SIXTH" above and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available
         for distribution pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to
         the issued but undrawn amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such
         amounts shall be held by the Agent in a cash collateral account and
         applied (A) first, to reimburse the Issuing Lender from time to time
         for any drawings under such Letters of Credit and (B) then, following
         the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to all other obligations of
         the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH" above in the manner
         provided in this Section 3.15(b).

                  3.16     EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

                  (a)      Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts
         evidencing each Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to
         time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
         to such Lender from time to time under this Loan Agreement. Each Lender
         will make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or
         accounts and to promptly update its account or accounts from time to
         time, as necessary.

                  (b)      The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to
         Section 11.3(c), and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register
         and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type
         and Interest Period of each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any
         principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable to
         each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
         Agent hereunder from or for the account of any Credit Party and each
         Lender's share thereof. The Agent will make reasonable efforts to
         maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts referred to in the preceding
         sentence and to promptly update such subaccounts from time to time, as
         necessary.

                  (c)      The entries made in the accounts, Register and
         subaccounts maintained pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 3.16
         (and, if consistent with the entries of the Agent, clause (a)) shall be
         prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of
         the Credit Parties therein recorded; provided, however, that the
         failure of any Lender or the Agent to maintain any such account, such
         Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein, shall
         not in any manner affect the obligation of the Credit Parties to repay
         the Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender.

                  3.17     MANDATORY ASSIGNMENT.

         In the event any Lender delivers to the Borrower any notice in
accordance with Section 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.11, then, provided that no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at such time, the Borrower
may, at its own expense (such expense to include any transfer fee


                                       53
<PAGE>

payable to the Agent under Section 11.3(b)), and in its sole discretion require
such Lender to transfer and assign in whole or in part, without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of Section 11.3(b)), all
or part of its interests, rights and obligations under this Loan Agreement to
any assignee which shall assume such assigned obligations, provided that (i)
such assignee shall be (a) any Lender or any Affiliate or Subsidiary of a
Lender, or (b) any other commercial bank, financial institution or "accredited
investor" (as defined in Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission)
reasonably acceptable to the Agent, (ii) such assignment shall not conflict with
any law, rule or regulation or order of any court or other Governmental
Authority and (iii) the Borrower or such assignee shall have paid to the
assigning Lender in immediately available funds the principal of and interest
accrued to the date of such payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all
other amounts owed to it hereunder (including, without limitation, any amounts
owing pursuant to Section 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, or 3.11).

                                    SECTION 4

                                    GUARANTY

                  4.1      THE GUARANTY.

         Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement, and the
Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt
payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof.
The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit Party Obligations
are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same,
without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension
of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same
will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

         Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in
any other of the Loan Documents or Hedging Agreements, the obligations of each
Guarantor under this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render
such obligations subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.

                  4.2      OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and
several, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness,
validity, regularity or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents or Hedging
Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all


                                       54
<PAGE>

circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against the Borrower or
any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until such time as the
Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not alter or
impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall remain absolute and
unconditional as described above:

                  (a)      at any time or from time to time, without notice to
         any Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any
         of the Credit Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance
         or compliance shall be waived;

                  (b)      any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of
         any of the Loan Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any
         Consolidated Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents or such
         Hedging Agreements shall be done or omitted;

                  (c)      the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations
         shall be accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         modified, supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under
         any of the Loan Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any
         Consolidated Party and any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any
         other agreement or instrument referred to in the Loan Documents or such
         Hedging Agreements shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the
         Credit Party Obligations or any security therefor shall be released,
         impaired or exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

                  (d)      any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Agent or any
         Lender or Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations
         shall fail to attach or be perfected; or

                  (e)      any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be
         determined to be void or voidable (including, without limitation, for
         the benefit of any creditor of any Guarantor) or shall be subordinated
         to the claims of any Person (including, without limitation, any
         creditor of any Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Loan Documents,
any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and any Lender, or any
Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the
Loan Documents or such Hedging Agreements, or against any other Person under any
other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit Party Obligations.

                  4.3      REINSTATEMENT.

         The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel)


                                       55

incurred by the Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or
restoration, including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against
any claim alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent
transfer or similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

                  4.4      CERTAIN ADDITIONAL WAIVERS.

         Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of
recourse to security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the
exercise of rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the
exercise of rights of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

                  4.5      REMEDIES.

         The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the
other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2)
for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents and that the
Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms
thereof.

                  4.6      RIGHTS OF CONTRIBUTION.

         The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the Credit Party Obligations until such time
as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied, and none of the
Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any
other Guarantor until such Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied.
For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount
paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Credit Party
Obligations; (b) "Pro Rata Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of
any payment of Credit Party Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage)
as of the date of such payment of Credit Party Obligations of (i) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and
properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other
properties of all of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts
and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of
the Credit Parties; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro
Rata Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Credit Party
Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any
such


                                       56
<PAGE>

payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such payment and
the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor
became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such
payment; and (c) "Contribution Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect
of any Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed as a
percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and properties exceeds
the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor (including contingent,
subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the
obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by which the
aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other properties of the
Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment exceeds the amount of
all of the debts and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured,
and unliquidated liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit
Parties) of the Credit Parties other than the maker of such Excess Payment;
provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Contribution Shares of
the Guarantors in respect of any Excess Payment, any Guarantor that became a
Guarantor subsequent to the date of any such Excess Payment shall be deemed to
have been a Guarantor on the date of such Excess Payment and the financial
information for such Guarantor as of the date such Guarantor became a Guarantor
shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection with such Excess Payment.
This Section 4.6 shall not be deemed to affect any right of subrogation,
indemnity, reimbursement or contribution that any Guarantor may have under
applicable law against the Borrower in respect of any payment of Credit Party
Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights of contribution against
any Guarantor shall terminate from and after such time, if ever, that such
Guarantor shall be relieved of its obligations pursuant to Section 8.5.

                  4.7      GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT; CONTINUING GUARANTEE.

         The guarantee in this Section 4 is a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Credit Party
Obligations whenever arising.

         subsidiaries or any other Guarantor to perform its obligations under
         the documentation for the Credit Facilities or the ability of the
         Lenders to exercise their rights thereunder.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Credit Parties hereby represent to the Agent and each Lender that:

                  6.1      FINANCIAL CONDITION.

                  (a)      The audited consolidated and unaudited consolidating
         balance sheets and income statements of the Consolidated Parties for
         the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000
         (including the notes thereto) (i) have been audited (with respect to
         such consolidated statements) by Ernst & Young LLP, (ii) have been
         prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the
         periods covered thereby and (iii) present fairly in all material
         respects (on the basis disclosed in the footnotes to such financial
         statements) the consolidated and consolidating financial condition,
         results of operations and cash flows (consolidated only) of the
         Consolidated Parties as of such date and for such periods. The
         unaudited interim balance sheets of the Consolidated Parties as at the
         end of, and the related unaudited interim statements of earnings and of
         cash flows for the 6-month period ended June 30, 2001 and each fiscal
         month and quarterly period ended after June 30, 2001 and prior to the
         Closing Date (i) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for
         the omission of footnotes and subject to year end audit adjustment)
         consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby and (ii)
         present fairly the consolidated and consolidating financial condition,
         results of operations and cash flows (consolidated only) of the
         Consolidated Parties as of such date and for such periods. During the
         period from June 30, 2001 to and including the Closing Date, there has
         been no sale, transfer or other disposition by any Consolidated Party
         of any material part of the business or property of the Consolidated
         Parties, taken as a whole, and no purchase or other acquisition (other
         than the Transaction and the acquisition of substantially all of the
         assets of the Pharmaceutical Education and Development Foundation of
         the Medical University of South Carolina) by any of them of any
         business or property (including any Capital Stock of any other Person)
         material in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the
         Consolidated Parties, taken as a whole, in each case, which is not
         reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the notes thereto
         and has not otherwise been disclosed in writing to the Lenders on or
         prior to the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date, the Borrower and its
         Subsidiaries have no material liabilities (contingent or otherwise)
         that are not reflected in the foregoing financial statements or in the
         notes thereto.

                  (b)      The pro forma consolidated balance sheet of the
         Consolidated Parties as of the Closing Date giving effect to the
         Acquisition in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and
         reflecting estimated purchase accounting adjustments is based upon
         reasonable assumptions made known to the Lenders and upon information
         not known to be incorrect or misleading in any material respect.

                  (c)      The financial statements delivered pursuant to
         Section 7.1(a) and (b) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
         (except as may otherwise be permitted under Section 7.1(a) and (b)) and
         present fairly in all material respects (in the case of such statements
         delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(a), on the basis disclosed in the
         footnotes to


                                       63
<PAGE>

         such financial statements) the consolidated and consolidating financial
         condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Consolidated
         Parties as of such date and for such periods.

                  6.2      NO MATERIAL CHANGE.

         Since December 31, 2000, there has been no development or event
relating to or affecting a Consolidated Party which has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  6.3      ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

existing and is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, (b) has the corporate or other necessary power
and authority, and the legal right, to own and operate its property, to lease
the property it operates as lessee and to conduct the business in which it is
currently engaged and (c) is duly qualified as a foreign entity and in good
standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing would not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  6.4      POWER; AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS.

         Each of the Credit Parties has the corporate or other necessary power
and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform the Loan
Documents to which it is a party, and in the case of the Borrower, to obtain
extensions of credit hereunder, and has taken all necessary corporate or other
necessary action to authorize the borrowings and other extensions of credit on
the terms and conditions of this Loan Agreement and to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party. No
consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other similar act by or
in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required to be
obtained or made by or on behalf of any Credit Party in connection with the
borrowings or other extensions of credit hereunder, with the execution,
delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents to which
such Credit Party is a party or with the consummation of the Transaction, except
for (i) consents, authorizations, notices and filings described in Schedule 6.4,
all of which have been obtained or made or have the status described in such
Schedule 6.4 and (ii) filings and other actions to perfect the Liens created by
the Collateral Documents. This Loan Agreement has been, and each other Loan
Document to which any Credit Party is a party will be, duly executed and
delivered on behalf of the Credit Parties. This Loan Agreement constitutes, and
each other Loan Document to which any Credit Party is a party when executed and
delivered will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Credit
Party enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law) or by principles of
good faith and fair dealing.

                  6.5      NO CONFLICTS.

         Neither the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, nor performance of and
compliance with the terms and


                                       64
<PAGE>

provisions thereof by such Credit Party will (a) violate or conflict with any
provision of its articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational or governing documents of such Person, (b) violate, contravene or
materially conflict with any Requirement of Law or any other law, regulation
(including, without limitation, Regulation U or Regulation X), order, writ,
judgment, injunction, decree or permit applicable to it, (c) violate, contravene
or conflict with contractual provisions of, or cause an event of default under,
any material indenture, loan agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, contract or
other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be
bound, except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) where such violations or
conflicts would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect, or (d) result in or require the creation of any
Lien (other than those contemplated in or created in connection with the Loan
Documents) upon or with respect to its properties.

                  6.6      NO DEFAULT.

         No Consolidated Party is in default in any respect under any contract,
lease, loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, security agreement or other
agreement or obligation to which it is a party or by which any of its properties
is bound which default could have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event
of Default exists except as previously disclosed in writing to the Lenders.

                  6.7      OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTIES.

         Except as set forth in Schedule 6.7, each Consolidated Party (i) holds
interests as lessee under valid leases in full force and effect with respect to
all material leased real and personal property used in connection with its
business, (ii) possesses or has rights to use licenses, patents, copyrights,
trademarks, service marks, trade names and other assets sufficient to enable it
to continue to conduct its business substantially as heretofore conducted and
without any material conflict with the rights of others, and (iii) has good
title to all of its other properties and assets reflected in the most recent
financial statements referred to in Section 6.1(a) (except as sold or otherwise
disposed of since the date thereof in the ordinary course of business and except
those properties which would not be reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect), in each case under (i), (ii) and
(iii) above free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

                  6.8      INDEBTEDNESS.

         Except as otherwise permitted under Section 8.1, the Consolidated
Parties have no material Indebtedness.

                  6.9      LITIGATION.

         Except as disclosed in Schedule 6.9, there does not exist (i) any
order, decree, judgment, ruling or injunction which restrains the consummation
of the acquisition of the Acquired Product in the manner contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement or (ii) any pending or threatened action, suit or legal,
equitable, arbitration or administrative proceeding against any Consolidated
Party which would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  6.10     TAXES.

         Each Consolidated Party has filed, or caused to be filed, all tax
returns (Federal, state, local and foreign) required to be filed and paid (a)
all amounts of taxes shown thereon to be due (including interest and penalties)
and (b) all other taxes, fees, assessments and other governmental charges
(including mortgage recording taxes, documentary stamp taxes and intangibles
taxes) owing by it, except for such taxes (i) which are not yet delinquent or
(ii) that are being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings, and
against which adequate reserves are being maintained in accordance with GAAP. No
Credit Party is aware as of the Closing Date of any proposed tax assessments
against it or any other Consolidated Party.

                  6.11     COMPLIANCE WITH LAW.

         Each Consolidated Party is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
and all other laws, rules, regulations, orders and decrees (including without
limitation Environmental Laws) applicable to it, or to its properties, unless
such failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  6.12     ERISA.

         Except as disclosed and described in Schedule 6.12 attached hereto:

                  (a)      During the five-year period prior to the date on
         which this representation is made or deemed made: (i) no ERISA Event
         has occurred, and, to the knowledge of the Executive Officers of the
         Credit Parties, no event or condition has occurred or exists as a
         result of which any ERISA Event could reasonably be expected to occur,
         with respect to any Plan; (ii) no "accumulated funding deficiency," as
         such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the
         Code, whether or not waived, has occurred with respect to any
         applicable Plan; (iii) each Plan has been maintained, operated, and
         funded in material compliance with its own terms and in material
         compliance with the provisions of ERISA, the Code, and any other
         applicable Federal or state laws; and (iv) no Lien in favor of the PBGC
         or a Plan has arisen, and, to the knowledge of the Executive Officers
         of the Credit Parties, no event or condition has occurred or exists as
         a result of which, such a Lien is reasonably likely to arise on account
         of any Plan.

                  (b)      The actuarial present value of all "benefit
         liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA), whether or
         not vested, under each Single Employer Plan, as of the last annual
         valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is made
         or deemed made (determined, in each case, in accordance with Financial
         Accounting Standards Board Statement 87, utilizing the actuarial
         assumptions used in such Plan's most recent actuarial valuation
         report), did not exceed as of such valuation date the fair market value
         of the assets of such Plan.

                  (c)      Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliate has incurred, or, to the knowledge of the Executive Officers
         of the Credit Parties, could be reasonably expected to incur, any
         withdrawal liability under ERISA to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
         Employer Plan. Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA


                                       66
<PAGE>

         Affiliate would become subject to any withdrawal liability under ERISA
         if any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw
         completely from all Multiemployer Plans and Multiple Employer Plans as
         of the valuation date most closely preceding the date on which this
         representation is made or deemed made. Neither any Consolidated Party
         nor any ERISA Affiliate has received any notification that any
         Multiemployer Plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of Section
         4241 of ERISA), is insolvent (within the meaning of Section 4245 of
         ERISA), or has been terminated (within the meaning of Title IV of
         ERISA), and no Multiemployer Plan is, to the knowledge of the Executive
         Officers of the Credit Parties, reasonably expected to be in
         reorganization, insolvent, or terminated.

                  (d)      To the knowledge of the Executive Officers of the
         Credit Parties, no prohibited transaction (within the meaning of
         Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or breach of
         fiduciary responsibility has occurred with respect to a Plan which has
         subjected or may subject any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate
         to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or
         Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other instrument
         pursuant to which any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate has
         agreed or is required to indemnify any Person against any such
         liability.

                  (e)      Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA
         Affiliates has any material liability with respect to "expected
         post-retirement benefit obligations" within the meaning of the
         Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 106. Each Plan which is
         a welfare plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) to which Sections
         601-609 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code apply has been
         administered in material compliance with such sections.

                  (f)      Neither the execution and delivery of this Loan
         Agreement nor the consummation of the financing transactions
         contemplated thereunder will involve any transaction which is subject
         to the prohibitions of Sections 404, 406 or 407 of ERISA or in
         connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section 4975
         of the Code. The representation by the Credit Parties in the preceding
         sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of the
         Lenders' representation in Section 11.15 with respect to their source
         of funds and is subject, in the event that the source of the funds used
         by the Lenders in connection with this transaction is an insurance
         company's general asset account, to the application of Prohibited
         Transaction Class Exemption 95-60, 60 Fed. Reg. 35,925 (1995),
         compliance with the regulations issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of
         ERISA, or the issuance of any other prohibited transaction exemption or
         similar relief, to the effect that assets in an insurance company's
         general asset account do not constitute assets of an "employee benefit
         plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within
         the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code.

                  6.13     CORPORATE STRUCTURE; CAPITAL STOCK, ETC.

         The corporate ownership structure of the Consolidated Parties as of the
Closing Date after giving effect to the Transaction is as described in Schedule
6.13A. Set forth on Schedule 6.13B is a complete and accurate list as of the
Closing Date with respect to the Borrower and each of its direct and indirect
Subsidiaries of (i) jurisdiction of incorporation, (ii) number of shares of each
class of Capital Stock outstanding, (iii) number and percentage of outstanding
shares of each class owned (directly or indirectly) by the Consolidated Parties
and (iv) number and effect, if exercised, of all outstanding options, warrants,
rights of conversion or purchase and all other similar rights with


                                       67
<PAGE>

respect thereto as of the Closing Date. The outstanding Capital Stock of all
such Persons is validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and is owned by
the Consolidated Parties, directly or indirectly, in the manner set forth on
Schedule 6.13B, free and clear of all Liens (other than those arising under or
contemplated in connection with the Loan Documents). Other than as set forth in
Schedule 6.13B, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding
any securities convertible into or exchangeable for its Capital Stock nor does
any such Person have outstanding any rights to subscribe for or to purchase or
any options for the purchase of, or any agreements providing for the issuance
(contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any
character relating to its Capital Stock.

                  6.14     GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS, ETC.

                  (a)      None of the transactions contemplated by this Loan
         Agreement (including, without limitation, the direct or indirect use of
         the proceeds of the Loans) will violate or result in a violation of the
         Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act or any of Regulations U and
         X. If requested by any Lender or the Agent, the Borrower will furnish
         to the Agent and each Lender a statement, in conformity with the
         requirements of FR Form U-1 referred to in Regulation U, that no part
         of the Letters of Credit or proceeds of the Loans will be used,
         directly or indirectly, for the purpose of "buying" or "carrying" any
         "margin stock" within the meaning of Regulations U and X, or for the
         purpose of purchasing or carrying or trading in any securities.

                  (b)      None of the Consolidated Parties is (i) an
         "investment company", or a company "controlled" by an "investment
         company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
         amended, (ii) a "holding company" as defined in, or otherwise subject
         to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
         amended or (iii) subject to regulation under any other Federal or state
         statute or regulation which limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

                  6.15     PURPOSE OF LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT.

         The proceeds of the Loans hereunder shall be used solely by the
Borrower to effect the Transaction, to pay fees and expenses related to the
Transaction and transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents, to refinance
the outstanding principal amount of existing indebtedness of the Borrower and to
provide for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries. The Letters of Credit shall be used only for or in connection
with appeal bonds, reimbursement obligations arising in connection with surety
and reclamation bonds, reinsurance, domestic or international trade transactions
and obligations not otherwise aforementioned relating to transactions entered
into by the applicable account party in the ordinary course of business.

                  6.16     ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

         Except as could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or as disclosed and described in Schedule 6.16 attached hereto:

                  7.5      PAYMENT OF TAXES AND OTHER CLAIMS.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay
and discharge (a) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
imposed upon it, or upon its income or profits, or upon any of its properties,
before they shall become delinquent and (b) all lawful claims (including claims
for labor, materials and supplies) which, if unpaid, might give rise to a Lien
upon any of its properties; provided, however, that no Consolidated Party shall
be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim which is
being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
adequate reserves therefor have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless
the failure to make any such payment (i) could give rise to an immediate right
to foreclose on a Lien securing such amounts or (ii) would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  7.6      INSURANCE.

                  (a)      Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its
         Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain in full force and effect
         insurance (including worker's compensation insurance, liability
         insurance, casualty insurance and business interruption insurance) in
         such amounts, covering such risks and liabilities and with such
         deductibles or self-insurance retentions as are in accordance with
         normal industry practice. The Agent shall be named as loss payee or
         mortgagee, as its interest may appear, and/or additional insured with
         respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect of any
         Collateral, and each provider of any such insurance shall agree, by
         endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by independent
         instruments furnished to the Agent, that it will give the Agent thirty
         (30) days prior written notice before any such policy or policies shall
         be altered or canceled. The present insurance coverage of the
         Consolidated Parties is outlined as to carrier, policy number,
         expiration date, type and amount on Schedule 7.6.

                  (b)      In the event that the Consolidated Parties receive
         Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $500,000 in aggregate amount during any
         fiscal year of the Consolidated Parties ("Excess Proceeds") on account
         of Involuntary Dispositions, the Credit Parties shall, within the
         period of 180 days following the date of receipt of such Excess
         Proceeds, apply (or cause to be applied) an amount equal to such Excess
         Proceeds to (i) make Eligible Reinvestments (including but not limited
         to the repair or replacement of the related Property) or (ii) prepay
         the Loans (and cash collateralize LOC Obligations) in accordance with
         the terms of Section 3.3(b)(ii)(B); provided, however, that such 180
         day period may be extended for not more than an additional 180 days if
         (i) the applicable Credit Party is diligently pursuing such Eligible
         Reinvestment in good faith, but can not complete within the initial 180
         days and (ii) the Borrower is not otherwise in Default. All insurance
         proceeds shall be subject to the security interest of the Agent (for
         the ratable benefit of the Lenders) under the Collateral Documents.
         Pending final application of any Excess Proceeds, the Credit Parties
         may apply such Excess Proceeds to temporarily reduce the Revolving
         Loans or to make Permitted Investments.

                  7.7      MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTY.

         Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, to
the extent consistent with ordinary prudent business practices, maintain and
preserve its properties and equipment


                                       76
<PAGE>

material to the conduct of its business in good repair, working order and
condition, normal wear and tear and Involuntary Dispositions excepted, and will
make, or cause to be made, in such properties and equipment from time to time
all repairs, renewals, replacements, extensions, additions, betterments and
improvements thereto as may be needed or proper, to the extent and in the manner
customary for companies in similar businesses; provided, however, a Credit Party
may discontinue the operation or maintenance of a property or piece of equipment
if the discontinuance (i) is desirable to the conduct of such Credit Party's
business and (ii) does not materially adversely affect the business of the
Credit Parties on a consolidated basis.

                  7.8      USE OF PROCEEDS.

         The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loans and will use the
Letters of Credit solely for the purposes set forth in Section 6.15.

                  7.9      AUDITS/INSPECTIONS.

         Upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, each Credit
Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, permit representatives
appointed by the Agent, including, without limitation, independent accountants,
agents, attorneys, and appraisers to visit and inspect its property, including
its books and records, its accounts receivable and inventory, its facilities and
its other business assets, and to make photocopies or photographs thereof and to
write down and record any information such representative obtains and shall
permit the Agent or its representatives to investigate and verify the accuracy
of information provided to the Lenders and to discuss all such matters with the
officers, employees and representatives of such Person. The Credit Parties agree
that the Agent, and its representatives, may, after the occurrence and during
the continuation of an Event of Default, conduct an audit of the Collateral, at
the expense of the Credit Parties.

Credit Parties will cause (A) 100% of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock
of each Domestic Subsidiary and (B) 65% (or such greater percentage that, due to
a change in an applicable Requirement of Law after the date hereof, (1) would

"German Subsidiary") as determined for United Stated federal income tax purposes
to be treated as a deemed dividend of the German Subsidiary's United States
parent or (B) could not reasonably be expected to cause any material adverse tax

a memorandum of lease with respect thereto, or other evidence of such lease in

Agent (or such other Person as may be required or desired under local law) for
the benefit of Lenders;

any prior fiscal year).

                  8.15     NO FURTHER NEGATIVE PLEDGES.

         The Credit Parties will not permit any Consolidated Party to enter
into, assume or become subject to any agreement prohibiting or otherwise
restricting the existence of any Lien upon any of its Property in favor of the
Agent (for the benefit of the Lenders) for the purpose of securing the Credit
Party Obligations, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or requiring the
grant of any security for any obligation if such Property is given as security
for the Credit Party Obligations, except (a) in connection with any document or
instrument governing Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 8.1(c), provided
that any such restriction contained therein relates only to the asset or assets
constructed or acquired in connection therewith, (b) in connection with any
Permitted Lien or any document or instrument governing any Permitted Lien,
provided that any such restriction contained therein relates only to the asset
or assets subject to such Permitted Lien and (c) pursuant to customary
restrictions and conditions contained in any agreement relating to the sale of
any Property permitted under Section 8.5, pending the consummation of such sale.

                  8.16     OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS.

         The Credit Parties will not permit any Consolidated Party to enter
into, assume or permit to exist any obligations for the payment of rental under
Operating Leases which in the aggregate for all such Persons would exceed
$9,000,000 in any fiscal year.

                  (c)      Covenants.  Any Credit Party shall:

                           (i)      default in the due performance or observance
                  of any term, covenant or agreement contained in Sections 7.2,
                  7.8, 7.10, 7.11 or 7.12 or Section 8;

                  period of at least 30 days after the earlier of an Executive
                  Officer of a Credit Party becoming aware of such default or
                  notice thereof by the Agent; or

                  (d)      Other Loan Documents. Except as a result of or in
         connection with a dissolution, merger or disposition of a Subsidiary
         not prohibited by Section 8.4 or Section 8.5, any Loan Document shall
         fail to be in full force and effect or to give the Agent and/or the
         Lenders the Liens, rights, powers and privileges purported to be
         created thereby, or any Credit Party shall so state in writing; or

                  (e)      Guaranties. Except as the result of or in connection
         with a dissolution, merger or disposition of a Subsidiary not

         be in full force and effect, or any Guarantor (including any Person
         after the Closing Date in accordance with Section 7.11) hereunder or
         any Person acting by or on behalf of such Guarantor shall deny or
         disaffirm such Guarantor's obligations under such guaranty, or any

                           (i)      Any Consolidated Party shall default in the
                  performance or observance (beyond the applicable grace period
                  with respect thereto, if any) or any material obligation or
                  condition of any contract or lease material to the
                  Consolidated Parties taken as a whole if such default could
                  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                           (ii)     With respect to any Indebtedness (other than
                  Indebtedness outstanding under this Loan Agreement) in excess
                  of $2,000,000 in the aggregate for the Consolidated Parties
                  taken as a whole, (A) either (1) a default in any payment
                  shall occur and continue (beyond the applicable grace period
                  with respect thereto, if any) with respect to any such
                  Indebtedness, or (2) a default in the observance or
                  performance relating to such Indebtedness or contained in any
                  instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or relating
                  thereto, or any other event or condition shall occur or exist,
                  the effect of which default or other event or condition is to
                  cause, or permit, the holder or holders of such Indebtedness
                  (or trustee or agent on behalf of such holders) to cause
                  (determined without regard to whether any notice or lapse of
                  time is required), any such Indebtedness to become due prior
                  to its stated maturity; or (B) any such Indebtedness shall be
                  declared due and payable, or required to be prepaid other than
                  by a regularly scheduled required prepayment, prior to the
                  stated maturity thereof; or

                  (h)      Judgments. One or more judgments or decrees shall be
         entered against one or more of the Consolidated Parties involving a
         liability of $2,000,000 or more in the aggregate (to the extent not
         paid or fully covered by insurance provided by a carrier who has
         acknowledged coverage and has the ability to perform) and any such
         judgments or decrees shall not have been vacated, discharged or stayed
         or bonded pending appeal within 30 days from the entry thereof; or

                  (i)      ERISA. Any of the following events or conditions, if
         such event or condition could involve possible taxes, penalties, and
         other liabilities in an aggregate amount in excess of $2,000,000: (i)
         any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in
         Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, whether or not
         waived, shall exist with respect to any Plan, or any lien shall arise
         on the assets of any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate in favor
         of the PBGC or a Plan; (ii) an ERISA Event shall occur with respect to
         a Single Employer Plan, which is, in the reasonable opinion of the
         Agent, likely to result in the termination of such Plan for purposes of
         Title IV of ERISA; (iii) an ERISA Event shall occur with respect to a
         Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, which is, in the
         reasonable opinion of the Agent, likely to result in (A) the
         termination of such Plan for purposes of Title IV of ERISA, or (B) any
         Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate incurring any liability in
         connection with a withdrawal from, reorganization of (within the
         meaning of Section 4241 of ERISA), or insolvency (within the meaning of
         Section 4245 of ERISA) of such Plan; or (iv) any prohibited transaction
         (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
         Code) or breach of fiduciary responsibility shall occur which may
         subject any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability
         under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l) of ERISA or Section 4975 of
         the Code, or under any agreement or other instrument pursuant to which
         any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate has agreed or is required
         to indemnify any person against any such liability; or


                                       91
<PAGE>

                  (j)      Ownership. There shall occur a Change of Control.

                  9.2      ACCELERATION; REMEDIES.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
the Agent may or, upon the request and direction of the Required Lenders, shall,
by written notice to the Credit Parties take any of the following actions:

                  (a)      Termination of Commitments. Declare the Commitments
         terminated whereupon the Commitments shall be immediately terminated.

                  (b)      Acceleration. Declare the unpaid Credit Party
         Obligations to be due, whereupon the same shall be immediately due and
         payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
         kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Credit Parties.

                  (c)      Cash Collateral. Direct the Borrower to pay (and the
         Borrower hereby promises to pay, upon receipt of such notice) to the
         Agent additional cash, to be held by the Agent, for the benefit of the
         Lenders, in a cash collateral account as additional security for the
         LOC Obligations in respect of subsequent drawings under all then
         outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount equal to the maximum
         aggregate amount which may be drawn under all Letters of Credits then
         outstanding.

                  (d)      Enforcement of Rights. Enforce any and all rights and
         interests created and existing under the Loan Documents including,
         without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the
         Collateral Documents, all rights and remedies against a Guarantor and
         all rights of set-off.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default specified in
Section 9.1(f) shall occur with respect to the Borrower, then, without the
giving of any notice or other action by the Agent or the Lenders, (i) the
Commitments automatically shall terminate, (ii) all of the outstanding Credit
Party Obligations automatically shall immediately become due and payable, and
(iii) the Borrower automatically shall be obligated (and hereby promises) to pay
to the Agent additional cash, to be held by the Agent, for the benefit of the
Lenders, in a cash collateral account as additional security for the LOC
Obligations in respect of subsequent drawings under all then outstanding Letters
of Credit in an amount equal to the maximum aggregate amount which may be drawn
under all Letters of Credits then outstanding.

                                   SECTION 10

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

                  10.1     APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF AGENT.

                  (a)      Each Lender hereby irrevocably (subject to Section
         10.9) appoints, designates and authorizes the Agent to take such action
         on its behalf under the provisions of this Loan Agreement and each
         other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and


                                       92
<PAGE>

         perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
         this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such
         powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any
         provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other
         Loan Document, the Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities,
         except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Agent have or be
         deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender or
         participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities,
         duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Loan
         Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
         Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the
         use of the term "Agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
         reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or
         other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of
         any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of
         market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
         administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

                  (b)      The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders
         with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents
         associated therewith until such time (and except for so long) as the
         Agent may agree at the request of the Required Lenders to act for the
         Issuing Lender with respect thereto; provided, however, that the
         Issuing Lender shall have all of the benefits and immunities (i)
         provided to the Agent in this Section 10 with respect to any acts taken
         or omissions suffered by the Issuing Lender in connection with Letters
         of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the
         application and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the
         Letters of Credit as fully as if the term "Agent" as used in this
         Section 10 included the Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or
         omissions, and (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the
         Issuing Lender.

                  10.2     DELEGATION OF DUTIES.

         The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Loan Agreement or
any other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact
that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                  10.3     LIABILITY OF AGENT.

         No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Loan
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby
(except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with
its duties expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to
any Lender or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any
other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection
with, this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Loan Agreement
or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of any Credit Party or any other
party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or
participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance


                                       93
<PAGE>

or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books
or records of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof.

                  10.4     RELIANCE BY AGENT.

                  (a)      The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
         fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
         resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
         letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or
         other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
         and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
         and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
         any Credit Party), independent accountants and other experts selected
         by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
         to take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first
         receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
         appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
         its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and
         expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing
         to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be fully
         protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Loan
         Agreement or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or
         consent of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, if required
         hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
         pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and
         participants. Where this Loan Agreement expressly permits or prohibits
         an action unless the Required Lenders otherwise determine, the Agent
         shall, and in all other instances, the Agent may, but shall not be
         required to, initiate any solicitation for the consent or a vote of the
         Lenders.

                  (b)      For purposes of determining compliance with the
         conditions specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this
         Loan Agreement shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or
         accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or other matter either
         sent by the Agent to such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or
         satisfaction, or required thereunder to be consented to or approved by
         or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender.

                  10.5     NOTICE OF DEFAULT.

         The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults
in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Agent
for the account of the Lenders, unless the Agent shall have received written
notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Loan Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any
such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with
Section 9.2; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has received any
such direction, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action,
or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

                  10.6     CREDIT DECISION; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY AGENT.

         Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of
the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Agent
that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Credit
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable Requirements of
Law relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision
to enter into this Loan Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower
hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Loan Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other Credit Parties. Except for
notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to the
Lenders by the Agent herein, the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility
to provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or
creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related Person.

                  10.7     INDEMNIFICATION OF AGENT.

         Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent
not reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Credit Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each
Agent-Related Person from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Agent-Related Person, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by
reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation,
litigation, or proceeding or preparation of defense in connection therewith) the
Loan Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or
proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans, except to the extent such claim,
damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense is found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such
Agent-Related Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided,
however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required
Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for
purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall
reimburse the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and the allocated
costs of internal counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or
enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of,
or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Loan
Agreement, any other Loan Document, or


                                       95
<PAGE>

any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent
is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower. The
undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the Commitments, the
payment of all Credit Party Obligations hereunder and the resignation or
replacement of the Agent.

                  10.8     AGENT IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY.

         Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective
Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent or the Issuing Lender
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Credit Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank
of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Loan Agreement as
any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not
the Agent or the Issuing Lender, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include
Bank of America in its individual capacity.

                  10.9     SUCCESSOR AGENT.

         The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If
the Agent resigns under this Loan Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint
from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders which
successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at all
times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of
the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation
of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such
successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
administrative agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as
Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 and Sections 11.4 and 11.9 shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Loan Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has
accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring
Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the
duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

                  10.10    OTHER AGENTS; LEAD MANAGERS.

         None of the Lenders identified on the facing page or signature pages of
this Loan Agreement as a "Syndication Agent", "Documentation Agent", "Co-Agent",
"Lead Underwriter" or "Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Manager" shall have any
right, power, obligation,


                                       96
<PAGE>

liability, responsibility or duty under this Loan Agreement other than those
applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Lenders so identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not
rely, on any of the Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Loan
Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

                  11.2     RIGHT OF SET-OFF; ADJUSTMENTS.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time


                                       98
<PAGE>

or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any
time owing by such Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to or for the credit or the
account of any Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of such
Person now or hereafter existing under this Loan Agreement, under the Notes,
under any other Loan Document or otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender
shall have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations
may be unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify any affected Credit
Party after any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided,
however, that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such set-off and application. The rights of each Lender under this Section 11.2
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation,
other rights of set-off) that such Lender may have.

                  11.3     SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                  (a)      The provisions of this Loan Agreement shall be
         binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
         respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that none of
         the Credit Parties may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
         or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each
         Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by any Credit Party
         without such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Loan
         Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any
         Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
         assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated
         hereby, the Indemnified Parties) any legal or equitable right, remedy
         or claim under or by reason of this Loan Agreement.

                  (b)      Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible
         Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
         Loan Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the
         Loans (including for purposes of this subsection (b), its Participation
         Interests) at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the
         case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
         Lender's Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the
         case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
         Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the
         Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding
         thereunder) or principal outstanding balance of the Term Loan of the
         assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the
         date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement with respect to such
         assignment is delivered to the Agent, shall not be less than $5,000,000
         in the case of any assignment of a Revolving Commitment, or $1,000,000,
         in the case of any assignment of a Term Loan, unless each of the Agent
         and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
         Borrower otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
         withheld or delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an
         assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Loan Agreement with respect to the Loans or
         the Commitments assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not (x)
         apply to rights in respect of outstanding Swing Line Loans or (y)
         prohibit any Lender from assigning all or a portion of its rights and
         obligations among separate tranches on a non-pro rata basis, and (iii)
         the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent
         an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, together with a processing and
         recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
         by the Agent pursuant to subsection (c), from and after the effective
         date specified in each Assignment and


                                       99
<PAGE>

         Assumption Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party
         hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
         and Assumption Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
         under this Loan Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
         to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
         Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under this Loan
         Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
         covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
         this Loan Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
         shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.11, 3.12
         and 11.5). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute
         and deliver new or replacement Notes to the assigning Lender and the
         assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
         obligations under this Loan Agreement that does not comply with this
         subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Loan Agreement as a
         sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations
         in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

                  (c)      The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent
         of the Borrower, shall maintain at is address referred to in Section
         11.1 a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement delivered to it
         and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
         Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the Loans
         owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time
         (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and
         the Credit Parties, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person
         whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as
         a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Loan Agreement,
         notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available
         for inspection by the Credit Parties and any Lender, at any reasonable
         time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                  (d)      Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to,
         the Credit Parties or the Agent, sell participations to one or more
         banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such
         Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Loan Agreement (including
         all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans (including such
         Lender's Participation Interests) owing to it); provided that (i) such
         Lender's obligations under this Loan Agreement shall remain unchanged,
         (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
         hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Credit
         Parties, the Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely
         and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Loan Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
         pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
         that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Loan
         Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any
         provision of this Loan Agreement; provided that such agreement or
         instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent
         of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other
         modification that would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment of
         money is scheduled to be paid to such Participant, (ii) reduce the
         principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable to such Participant,
         (iii) except as the result of or in connection with a dissolution,
         merger or disposition of a Consolidated Party not prohibited by Section
         8.4 or 8.5, release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from
         their obligations under the Loan Documents or (iv) except as the result
         of or in connection with an Asset Disposition not prohibited by Section
         8.5, release all or substantially all of the Collateral.


                                      100
<PAGE>

         Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that
         each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6,
         3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
         acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
         Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
         entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as though it were a Lender,
         provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.14 as
         though it were a Lender.

                  (e)      A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
         greater payment under Section 3.6, 3.7 or 3.11 than the applicable
         Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
         participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
         participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
         written consent. A Participant that is not a United States person under
         Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall not be entitled to the benefits
         of Section 3.11 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation
         sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit
         of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.11(d) as though it were a
         Lender.

                  (f)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
         security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Loan
         Agreement (including under its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of
         such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations
         to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
         shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
         substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
         hereto.

                  (g)      If the consent of the Borrower to an assignment or to
         an Eligible Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an
         assignment which does not meet the minimum assignment threshold
         specified in clause (i) of the proviso to the first sentence of Section
         11.3(b)), the Borrower shall be deemed to have given its consent five
         Business Days after the date notice thereof has been delivered by the
         assigning Lender (through the Agent) unless such consent is expressly
         refused by the Borrower prior to such fifth Business Day.

                  (h)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
         herein, if at any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment
         and Loans pursuant to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, (i)
         upon five Business Days' notice to the Borrower, terminate its Swing
         Line Commitment and (ii) upon 30 days' notice to the Borrower and the
         Lenders, resign as Issuing Lender. In the event of any such termination
         of its Swing Line Commitment or resignation as Issuing Lender, the
         Borrower shall be entitled to appoint from among the Lenders a
         successor Swing Line Lender or Issuing Lender hereunder; provided,
         however, that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor
         shall affect the termination of Bank of America's Swing Line Commitment
         or the resignation of Bank of America as Issuing Lender, as the case
         may be. If Bank of America terminates its Swing Line Commitment, it
         shall retain all the rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for
         hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding
         as of the effective date of such termination, including the right to
         require the Lenders to make Revolving Loans or fund their Participation
         Interests in outstanding Swing Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.2(d).
         Bank of America shall retain all the rights and obligations of the
         Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit
         outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuing
         Lender and all LOC


                                      101
<PAGE>

         Obligations with respect thereto (including the right to require thc
         Lenders to make Revolving Loans or fund their Participation Interests
         pursuant to Section 2.4).


                  11.4     NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.

         No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan
Document and no course of dealing between the Agent or any Lender and any of the
Credit Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Loan Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and
remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or
demand on any Credit Party in any case shall entitle the Credit Parties to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or
constitute a waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders to any other or
further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

                  11.5     EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a)      The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to pay
         on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the
         syndication, preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
         modification, and amendment of this Loan Agreement, the other Loan
         Documents, and the other documents to be delivered hereunder,
         including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
         counsel for the Agent with respect thereto and with respect to advising
         the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under the Loan
         Documents. The Credit Parties further jointly and severally agree to
         pay on demand all costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if
         any (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
         expenses), in connection with any work-out or restructuring relating to
         the Credit Facilities or any enforcement (whether through negotiations,
         legal proceedings, or otherwise) of any of the Loan Documents.

                  (b)      Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
         are consummated, the Borrower agrees to indemnify, save and hold
         harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective
         Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and

         (a) any and all claims, demands, actions or causes of action that are
         asserted against any Indemnitee by any Person (other than the Agent or
         any Lender) relating directly or indirectly to a claim, demand, action

         Neither this Loan Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any of the

         Section 3.15 may not be amended, changed, waived, discharged or

         defenses to the Loan Documents or any transaction related to the Loan
         Documents, the same are hereby waived, relinquished and released in
         consideration of the Lenders' execution and delivery of this Loan

                  11.14    CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information
may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers, employees
and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being
understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of
the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential); (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory
authority; (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by
any subpoena or similar legal process; (d) to any other party to this Loan
Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any
suit, action or proceeding relating to this Loan Agreement or the enforcement of
rights hereunder; (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions
substantially the same as those of this Section 11.14, to (i) any Eligible

Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Loan Agreement or
(ii) any direct or indirect contractual counterparty or prospective counterparty
(or such contractual counterparty's or prospective counterparty's professional

Obligations; (g) with the consent of the Borrower; (h) to the extent such
Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section 11.14 or (ii) becomes available to the Agent or any Lender on a

exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

                  11.15    SOURCE OF FUNDS.

         Each of the Lenders hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower that
at least one of the following statements is an accurate representation as to the
source of funds to be used by such Lender in connection with the financing
hereunder:

                  (a)      no part of such funds constitutes assets allocated to
         any separate account maintained by such Lender in which any employee
         benefit plan (or its related trust) has any interest;

                  (b)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets allocated to any separate account maintained by such Lender,
         such Lender has disclosed to the Borrower the name of each employee
         benefit plan whose assets in such account exceed 10% of the total
         assets of such account as of the date of such purchase (and, for
         purposes of this clause (b), all employee benefit plans maintained by
         the same employer or employee organization are deemed to be a single
         plan);

                  (c)      to the extent that any part of such funds constitutes
         assets of an insurance company's general account, such insurance
         company has complied with all of the requirements of the regulations
         issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of ERISA; or

                  (d)      such funds constitute assets of one or more specific
         benefit plans which such Lender has identified in writing to the
         Borrower.

As used in this Section 11.15, the terms "employee benefit plan" and "separate
account" shall have the respective meanings assigned to such terms in Section 3
of ERISA.

                  11.16    REGULATION D.

         Each of the Lenders hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower that
it is a commercial lender, other financial institution or other "accredited"
investor (as defined in SEC Regulation D) which makes or acquires or loans on
the ordinary course of business and that it will make or acquire Loans for its
own account in the ordinary course of business.

                  11.17    CONFLICT.

         To the extent that there is a conflict or inconsistency between any
provision hereof, on the one hand, and any provision of any Loan Document, on
the other hand, this Loan Agreement shall control.
