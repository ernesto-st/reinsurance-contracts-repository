"Agreement") is entered into among University Health Plans, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation with its principal office at 555 Broad Street, 17th Floor, Newark,

Jersey, a body corporate politic of the State of New Jersey created pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-1, et seq. with its principal office at 65 Bergen Street,
Newark, New Jersey 07107 (the "Stockholder"), and Centene Corporation, a
Delaware corporation with its principal office at 7711 Carondelet Avenue, Suite
800, St. Louis, Missouri 63105 (the "Buyer").

                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

      A. The Stockholder owns 20 shares of the common stock, without par value
("Common Stock"), of the Company, which shares represent all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company.

      B. The Buyer desires to purchase, and the Stockholder desires to sell, 16
shares of Common Stock (the "Shares") for the consideration set forth below,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

      C. In connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares, the Buyer and
the Stockholder wish to enter into an Investor Rights Agreement providing for,
among other things, the exchange, on the third anniversary of the Closing Date
(as defined in Subsection 1.3), of the other four shares of Common Stock held by
the Stockholder for shares of common stock of Centene, all as contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Investor Rights Agreement to be entered into as of
the Closing Date in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT A (the "Investor Rights
Agreement").

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises hereinafter set
forth and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:

      1.   PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

           1.1. PURCHASE OF THE SHARES FROM THE STOCKHOLDER. Subject to and
      upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the closing of the
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing"), the
      Stockholder shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver the Shares
      to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase, acquire and accept the Shares
      from the Stockholder. At the Closing the Stockholder shall deliver to the
      Buyer a certificate or certificates evidencing the Shares, duly endorsed
      in blank or with a stock power duly executed by the Stockholder.

            1.2.     PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE SHARES

                     (a) The aggregate purchase price to be paid by the Buyer
            for all of the Shares (the "Purchase Price") shall be equal to 80%
            of the product of (i) $250.00 and (ii) the number of enrolled risk
            members of the Company as reflected in the final enrollment data
            provided by the New Jersey Division of Medical Assistance and
            Health Services with respect to the Closing Date, subject to
            adjustment pursuant to Subsections 6.1 and 6.8 (together, the
            "Closing Adjustments") and subject to reduction after the Closing
            Date pursuant to Section 8.

                     (b) The Purchase Price shall be payable in cash, by wire
            transfers of immediately available funds, as follows:

                         (i)  on the Closing Date (or, if the Closing Date is
                              not a business day, then the next succeeding
                              business day), the Buyer shall deliver to Fleet
                              Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"),
                              the sum of $5,500,000 to be held in an

<PAGE>

                              interest-bearing escrow account (the "Escrow
                              Account") pursuant to the terms of an Escrow
                              Agreement in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT B
                              (the "Escrow Agreement"), as a reserve to satisfy
                              any and all or part of any reduction in the
                              Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8; and

                         (ii) on the second business day following the date on
                              which the New Jersey Division of Medical
                              Assistance and Health Services provides the data
                              referred to in paragraph (a) of this Subsection
                              1.2 (but no earlier than the date of the payment
                              pursuant to the preceding clause (i)), (A) the
                              Buyer shall deliver to the Stockholder an amount
                              equal to the Purchase Price less (1) $5,500,000
                              and (2) the amount of the Closing Adjustments or
                              (B) in the event the Closing  Adjustments exceed
                              an amount equal to the Purchase Price less
                              $5,500,000, then the Stockholder shall deliver to
                              the Buyer an amount equal to (1) the Closing
                              Adjustments  less (2) the  Purchase  Price less
                              $5,500,000.

                     (c)      In the event of an adjustment in the Purchase
            Price as the result of one or both Closing Adjustments, the parties
            agree that it is in their mutual best interests for the Buyer to
            contribute to the Company an amount in cash equal to the aggregate
            amount of the Closing Adjustments. The Buyer hereby agrees that (i)
            to the extent a Closing Adjustment results in the payment of an
            amount in cash to the Buyer by the Stockholder, the Stockholder
            shall make such payment to the Company, on behalf of the Buyer and
            in satisfaction of the Buyer's obligations under this paragraph (c)
            with respect to such amount and (ii) to the extent a Closing
            Adjustment results in a reduction in the Purchase Price but not a
            payment of cash to the Buyer, the Buyer shall deliver to the Company
            the amount of such Closing Adjustment in cash on the date of the
            payment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Subsection 1.2.

                     (d)      As a condition to the Closing, the parties shall
            agree upon, for purposes of calculating the amount of any Closing
            Adjustment pursuant to Subsection 6.1 and for purposes of
            determining certain Damages under Section 8, a procedure for the
            preparation, by no later than the date of the payment pursuant to
            clause (b)(ii) of this Subsection 1.2, of a mutually agreed upon
            balance sheet, including the amount of premium receivable and other
            receivable (the "Closing Receivables"), and related calculation of
            net worth of the Company as of the Closing. The balance sheet
            referred to in the preceding sentence shall be prepared in
            accordance with the actuarial and accounting practices prescribed or
            permitted by the State of New Jersey Department of Banking and
            Insurance and, for the purposes of preparing such balance sheet, no
            premium receivable with respect to a state supplemental delivery
            payment shall be booked until an outcome (i.e., a live birth, still
            birth or miscarriage occurring at the thirteenth week or greater of
            gestation) has occurred.

            1.3. CLOSING. The Closing shall take place as of 12:01 a.m.,
      Eastern time, on the first calendar day of the calendar month that
      immediately follows the calendar month in which the conditions set forth
      in Sections 6 and 7 (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the
      Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their
      nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the
      occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such
      items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing)
      are first satisfied or waived, or on such later date as may be mutually
      agreed upon in writing by the parties. The date of the Closing, as so
      determined, is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."

            2.1. ORGANIZATION. The Stockholder is a body corporate politic of
      the State of New Jersey created pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:64G-1, et

      rights of creditors generally or by general equitable principles (the
      "Enforceability Exception").

      requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
      Act") and any applicable state securities laws, neither the execution and
      delivery by the Stockholder of this Agreement or the agreements provided

      "Governmental Entity"), (d) violate any judgment, decree, order or award
      of any Governmental Entity by which the Stockholder or any of its
      properties are bound, or (e) conflict with, result in breach of,

      consent or waiver under, any contract or instrument to which the
      Stockholder is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its
      assets are subject.

            2.4. TITLE TO SHARES. The Stockholder has good, valid and marketable
      title to the Shares, free and clear of any and all covenants, conditions,

            PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, the Company's independent public
            accountants. The Statutory Financial Statements have been

            Insurance applied on a basis consistent throughout the periods

<PAGE>
            the books and records of the Company, provided that the Financial
            Statements referred to in clause (ii) above are subject to normal
            recurring year-end adjustments (which will not be material) and do
            not include all footnotes required by such generally accepted
            accounting principles.

                  (c) The Stockholder or the Company has also previously
            delivered to the Buyer the unaudited Medicaid financial reports by
            rate cell grouping of the Company and for the six-month period ended
            June 30, 2002 (the "Medicaid Financial Reports"). The Medicaid
            Financial Reports have been prepared on a basis consistent
            throughout the period covered thereby, fairly present the results of
            operations of the Medicaid business of the Company for the six-month
            period ended June 30, 2002, and are consistent with the books and
            records of the Company.

                  (d) The reserves recorded in the accounting records of the
            Company for medical benefits, losses, claims and expenses incurred
            in connection with the Medicaid and commercial businesses of the
            Company and any other reserves (i) were prepared in accordance with
            the actuarial and accounting practices prescribed or permitted by
            the State of New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, (ii)
            make good and sufficient provisions for all insurance obligations of
            the Company, (iii) to the best knowledge of the Company, meet the
            requirements of any law, rule or regulation applicable to such
            reserves and the requirements of the Permits (as defined in
            paragraph (a) of Subsection 3.16), and (iv) are computed on the
            basis of assumptions consistent with those used in computing the
            corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal year. All payments to
            and/or settlements with providers of any medical services have been
            accounted for in the appropriate medical expense reserve account (by
            category of medical expense) and have been reflected as a medical
            expense of the Company.

                  (e) The Company has provided to Buyer true and correct
            documentation, electronic and otherwise, of data representing all
            medical claims (including all medical payments and/or settlements)
            of the Company's business as of June 30, 2002. The Company has also
            provided documentation, electronic and otherwise, that supports the
            medical claims data provided. The medical claims data provided to
            Buyer reflect any changes to the Company's business since its
            inception that would materially affect total medical costs. All paid
            medical claims and settlements of the Company's Medicaid business
            since January 1, 2001 have been properly reflected as medical
            expenses. All unpaid medical claims and settlements of the Company's
            Medicaid business since January 1, 2001 have been properly reflected
            as losses incurred but not reported for purposes of computing the
            Company's claims payable and claims adjustment expenses, except to
            the extent that any such unpaid medical claims and settlements do
            not exceed $50,000 in amount, in the aggregate, in either the year
            ended December 31, 2001 or the period subsequent to January 1, 2002.

                  (f) The amounts shown as accrued for current and deferred
            income and other taxes in the Current Balance Sheet are sufficient
            for the payment of all accrued and unpaid federal, state and local
            income taxes, interest, penalties, assessments or deficiencies
            applicable to the Company, whether disputed or not, for the six
            months ended June 30, 2002 and all periods prior thereto.

            3.7. ABSENCE OF UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. The Company has no
      liability or obligation, secured or unsecured, whether accrued, absolute,
      contingent, unasserted or otherwise, that is material to the condition
      (financial or otherwise) of the assets, properties, business or prospects
      of the Company, except as and to the extent (a) any such liability or
      obligation is reflected and reserved against in the Current Balance Sheet
      or (b) any such liability or obligation, other than a liability or
      obligation

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

      arising under a Provider Agreement (as defined in clause (a)(ii) of
      Subsection 3.15), either (i) was incurred in the ordinary course of
      business after June 30, 2002 or (ii) did not exceed $25,000 in amount, in
      the aggregate, in either the year ended December 31, 2001 or the period
      subsequent to January 1, 2002.

            3.8. LITIGATION. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
      investigation to which the Company is a party (either as a plaintiff or
      defendant) pending. To the knowledge of the Stockholder and the Company,
      (a) no such action, suit, proceeding or investigation is threatened before
      any Governmental Entity and (b) there is no basis for any such action,
      suit or proceeding. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation
      of which the Stockholder or the Company is aware pending or threatened
      before any Governmental Entity that challenges the validity or propriety
      of this Agreement or any action to be taken by the Stockholder or the
      Company in connection with this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any
      officer, director or employee of the Company has been permanently or
      temporarily enjoined by any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
      Entity from engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in
      connection with the business, assets or properties of the Company. There
      is not in existence on the date hereof any order, judgment or decree of
      any Governmental Entity that has been properly served or of which the
      Company or the Stockholder otherwise is aware enjoining or requiring the
      Company or the Stockholder to take any action of any kind with respect to
      the business, assets or properties of the Company.

            3.9.  INSURANCE. Section 3.9 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
      a true, correct and complete list of all fire, theft, casualty, general
      liability, workers compensation, business interruption, environmental
      impairment, product liability, automobile and other insurance policies
      maintained by the Company and of all life insurance policies maintained on
      the lives of any of its employees, specifying the type of coverage, the
      amount of coverage, the premium, the insurer and the expiration date of
      each such policy (collectively, the "Insurance Policies") and all claims
      made under such Insurance Policies since January 1, 2001. The Stockholder
      and the Company have previously delivered to the Buyer true, correct and
      complete copies of all Insurance Policies. The Insurance Policies are in
      full force and effect and are in amounts of a nature that are adequate and
      customary for the Company's business. All premiums due on the Insurance
      Policies or renewals thereof have been paid, and there is no default by
      the Company under the Insurance Policies. The Company has not received any
      notice or other communication from any issuer of the Insurance Policies
      since January 1, 2001 canceling or materially amending any of the
      Insurance Policies, materially increasing any deductibles or retained
      amounts thereunder, or materially increasing the annual or other premiums
      payable thereunder, and, to the knowledge of the Stockholder and the
      Company, no such cancellation, amendment or increase of deductibles,
      retainages or premiums is threatened. The Company has no outstanding
      claims or disputes with any insurance carrier regarding claims,
      settlements or premiums, and the Company has not failed to give any notice
      or present any claim under any Insurance Policy in due and timely fashion.
      There are no outstanding requirements or recommendations by any issuer of
      the Insurance Policies or by any Board of Fire Underwriters or other
      similar body exercising similar functions or by any governmental authority
      exercising similar functions that require or recommend any changes in the
      conduct of the business of, or any repairs or other work to be done on or
      with respect to any of the properties or assets of, the Company.

             3.10. ASSETS. The Company has good and marketable title to all of
      the assets (tangible or intangible) purported to be owned by the Company
      and relating to, or used in, its business, free and clear of all liens,
      leases, encumbrances, claims under bailment and storage agreements,
      equities, conditional sales contracts, security interests, charges and
      restrictions, except for liens, if any, for personal property taxes not

      conduct of its business as presently conducted and as presently proposed
      to be conducted. Each such tangible asset is free from material defects,
      has been maintained in accordance with normal

                                     - 7 -

      normal wear and tear) and is suitable for the purposes for which it
      presently is used. Each item of equipment and other asset that the Company
      has possession of pursuant to a lease agreement or other contractual
      arrangement and relating to, or used in, its business is in such condition
      that, upon its return to its lessor or owner under the applicable lease or
      contract, the obligations of the Company to such lessor owner will have
      been discharged in full.

            3.11.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

            excluding (A) rights under the Medicaid Contract and (B)
            off-the-shelf software programs licensed by the Company pursuant
            shrink wrap and similar licenses (the "Intellectual Property");
            and (ii) a true, correct and complete list of all licenses or
            similar agreements or arrangements to which the Company is a
            party, either as licensee or licensor, with respect to the

            owner of all right, title and interest in and to the Intellectual
            Property and all designs, permits, labels and packages used on or
            in connection therewith, free and clear of all liens, security
            interests, charges, encumbrances, equities or other adverse
            claims. The Company has the right and authority to use, and to

            presently conducted, and such use or continuing use does not and
            will not conflict with, infringe upon or violate any rights of
            any other person, corporation or entity.

                   (b) The Company has not received any notice of, nor has any
            knowledge of any basis for, a pleading or threatened claim,
            interference action or other judicial or adversarial proceeding
            against the Company that any of the operations, activities,
            products, services or publications of the Company infringes or
            will infringe any patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, trade
            secret or other property right of a third party, or that it is
            illegally or otherwise using the trade secrets, formulae or
            property rights of others. There are no outstanding, nor to the
            knowledge of the Stockholder or the Company, any threatened,
            disputes or other disagreements with respect to any licenses or
            similar agreements or arrangements described in Section 3.11 of
            the Disclosure Schedule or with respect to infringement by a
            third party of any of the Intellectual Property. Neither the

            party is infringing, or will threaten to infringe, upon or
            otherwise violate any of the Intellectual Property in which the
            Company has ownership rights.

            Company is sufficient to conduct the Company's business as presently
            conducted. The Company has taken all steps reasonably necessary to

            Property and the continued use of the Intellectual Property.

            Company or the Stockholder, nor any spouse, child or other relative
            or affiliate thereof, owns directly or indirectly, in whole or in
            part, any of the Intellectual Property.

            3.12.  REAL ESTATE

                   (a) Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
            identity of the sole lease of real property to which the
            Company is a party (the "Lease"). The Stockholder and the Company
            have previously delivered to the Buyer a true, correct and
            complete copy of the Lease and all amendments, modifications and
            supplemental agreements thereto. The Lease is in full force and

            has delivered written notice to the other claiming that such
            party is in default thereunder and that such default remains
            uncured. To the knowledge of the Stockholder and the Company, no
            event has occurred that would constitute a breach of or default
            in the performance of any covenant, agreement or condition
            contained in the Lease, nor has any event occurred that with the
            passage of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute
            such a breach or material default. The Company is not obligated
            to pay any leasing or brokerage commission relating to the Lease
            and, will not have any obligation to pay any leasing or brokerage
            commission upon the renewal of the Lease. No construction,
            alteration or other leasehold improvement work with respect to
            the Lease remains to be paid for or to be performed by the
            Company.

                   (b) The Company does not own any real property.

            of ERISA, relating to the Company's employees, or maintained at any
            time since June 30, 1999 by the Company or by any other member (as
            used in this Subsection 3.18, a "Plan Affiliate") of any controlled
            group of corporations, group of trades or businesses under common
            control, or affiliated service group (as defined for purposes of
            Section 414(b), (c) and (m), respectively, of the Internal Revenue
            Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) (the "Employee Plans"), and
            the Company has no obligations, contingent or otherwise, past or
            present, under applicable law or the terms of any Employee Plan.

                   (b) With respect to all Employee Plans, the Company and its
            Plan Affiliates are in compliance with the requirements prescribed
            by any and all statutes, orders or governmental rules or regulations
            currently in effect, including ERISA and the Code, applicable to
            such Employee Plans, including all reporting, notice and disclosure
            requirements. The Company and its Plan Affiliates have in all
            respects performed all obligations required to be performed by them
            under, and is not in violation in any respect of, and there has been
            no default or violation by any other party with respect to, any of
            the Employee Plans. Neither the Company nor any Plan Affiliate has
            failed to pay any amounts due and owing as required by the terms of
            any Employee Plan.

                   (c) There is no multiemployer plan to which the Company or
            its Plan Affiliates contribute, are required to contribute, or have
            ever been required to contribute, or to which any of the employees
            are beneficiaries as a result of their employment with the Company.

                   (d) No Employee Plan provides health or life insurance
            benefits for retirees.

                   (e) The Company has previously delivered to the Buyer true,
            correct and complete copies of all Employee Plans and all
            agreements, including trust agreements and insurance contracts,
            related to such Employee Plans.

                   (f) Each Employee Plan intended to qualify under Section
            401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue
            Service to so qualify, and the trusts created thereunder have been
            determined to be exempt from tax under the provisions of Section
            501(a).

                   (g) Neither the Company nor any corporation or trade or
            business (whether or not incorporated) that would be treated as a
            member of the controlled group of the Company under Section
            4001(a)(14) of ERISA would be liable for any amount pursuant to
            Section 4062, 4063, 4064, 4068 or 4069 of ERISA if any of the
            Employee Plans that are subject to Title IV of ERISA were to
            terminate. All premiums or other payments required by the terms of
            any group or individual insurance policies and programs maintained
            by the Company and covering any present or former employees of the
            Company with respect to all periods up to and including the Closing
            Date have been fully paid for the length of the obligation. To the
            extent not heretofore satisfied or accrued on the Current Balance
            Sheet, the Stockholder shall be responsible for, and shall cause to
            be paid without using any of the Company's assets, any welfare
            benefits not fully covered by third-party insurance policies or
            programs relating to claims incurred by present or former employees
            of the Company on or before the Closing Date.

            proceedings by present or former employees of the Company or its
            affiliates, plan participants, beneficiaries or spouses of any of
            the above, the Internal Revenue Service, the PBGC, or any other
            person or entity involving any Employee Plan including claims
            against the assets of any trust, involving any Employee Plan, or any
            rights or benefits thereunder, other than ordinary and usual claims
            for benefits by participants or beneficiaries including claims
            pursuant to domestic relations orders.

                   (i) Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Schedule specifies those
            Employee Plans that are to be continued by the Company following the
            Closing Date and those that are to be terminated. At the Buyer's
            election, the Company shall take any actions as may be necessary or
            appropriate under all applicable laws and the terms of the Employee
            Plans to establish the Buyer, or an affiliate of the Buyer, as
            having all rights and obligations with respect to any of the
            Employee Plans that are to be continued including rights with
            respect to all annuity or insurance contracts that form a part of
            any of such Employee Plans, together with all other Employee Plan
            assets. The Company shall obtain as of the Closing Date any and all
            consents from trustees required to effect any transfer of any
            trust(s) related to such assumed Employee Plans to such trustee(s)
            as may be appointed by the Buyer.

                   (j) Except as heretofore accrued on the Current Financial
            Statements, there are no liabilities with respect to any Employee
            Plan that relate to any period prior to the Closing Date, including
            any taxes, accrued vacation or sick pay (whether or not vested),
            accrued vacation, sick and personal leaves, employee policies,
            employee benefit claims or liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
            Corporation. Without limiting the foregoing and except as
            contemplated hereby, no employees of the Company will be entitled to
            any severance pay by reason of the consummation of the transactions
            contemplated by this Agreement, and no severance pay will have
            accrued prior to the Closing Date and will be payable to any
            employees upon any subsequent termination of their employment after
            the Closing Date.

      been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. This Agreement and
      all such other agreements and written obligations entered into and
      undertaken in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
      constitute the valid and binding obligations of the Buyer, enforceable

      each case to the Enforceability Exception.

            4.3.  NON-CONTRAVENTION. Neither the execution and delivery of this

      consent or waiver under, any contract or instrument to which the Buyer is
      a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its assets are subject,
      except in any such case for (i) compliance with applicable requirements of
      the Securities Act, any applicable state securities laws and the Exchange
      Act, (ii) approval of the State of New Jersey Department of Banking and
      Insurance and the New Jersey Department of Human Services, Division of
      Medical Assistance and Health Services of the transactions contemplated

            4.4.  INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION. The Buyer is acquiring the Shares
      from the Stockholder for the Buyer's own account for investment only and
      not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution of
      the Shares in violation of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation
      thereunder. The Buyer has no present intention of distributing or selling
      the Shares, and the Buyer has no present or contemplated agreement,
      undertaking, arrangement, obligation, indebtedness or commitment providing
      for the disposition of the Shares. The Buyer is an "accredited investor"
      within the meaning of Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. The Buyer has
      had adequate opportunity to obtain from representatives of the Company
      such information about the Company as is necessary for the Buyer to
      evaluate the merits and risks of the Buyer's acquisition of the Shares
      pursuant to this Agreement. The Buyer acknowledges that it has received
      certain forward-looking information from the Stockholder or the Company in
      connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
      The Buyer understands that neither the Company nor the Stockholder can
      guarantee that the Company actually will achieve the plans, intentions or
      expectations disclosed in such forward-looking statements and that the
      Company's actual results could differ materially from the plans,
      intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements.
      The Buyer has sufficient expertise in business and financial matters to be
      able to evaluate the risks involved in the acquisition of the Shares
      pursuant to the Agreement and to make an informed investment decision with
      respect to such acquisition. The Buyer understands that (a) the Shares
      have not been registered under the Securities Act and are "restricted
      securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and
      (b) the Shares cannot be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of unless
      they are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an

                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

      exemption from registration is then available. A legend substantially in
      the following form will be placed on the certificate or certificates
      representing the Shares:

            "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
            under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may not be sold,
            transferred or otherwise disposed of in the absence of an effective
            registration statement under such Act or an opinion of counsel
            satisfactory to the corporation to the effect that such registration
            is not required."

            offices, properties, books and records of the Company, so that the
            Buyer may have full opportunity to make such investigation as it
            shall desire to make of the management, business, properties and
            affairs of the Company, and the Buyer shall be permitted to make
            abstracts from, or copies of, all such books and records. The
            Stockholder and the Company shall furnish to the Buyer such
            financial and operating data and other information as to the
            business of the Company as the Buyer shall reasonably request.

            of the Stockholder and the Company shall specifically waive all
            previous claims of privilege or other restrictions, and in any case
            where a release by a present or former employee of the Company is

            efforts to obtain such a release.

      of the Shares by the Buyer without the consent of the Buyer, on one hand,

      disposed of the Commercial Business and shall have delivered the Guarantee
      to the Buyer; which Guarantee shall be satisfactory to the Buyer in form

      reflected as losses incurred but not reported for the purposes of
      computing the Company's claims payable and claims adjustment expenses,
      provided that if such Office is unable to deliver such certification, the
      Buyer, in its discretion, may determine to waive the preceding condition
      and, as consideration therefor, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
      amount that such Office certifies the Company has failed to properly
      reflect in claims payable and claims adjustment expenses with respect to
      its Medicaid business.

            6.9.     MEDICAID CONTRACT. The Buyer shall have received such
      assurances, as the Buyer shall, in its sole discretion, deem sufficient
      that neither the sale of the Shares as contemplated hereby nor any other
      actions contemplated hereby will materially affect any of the Company's
      rights under the Medicaid Contract.

      governmental body or person whatsoever that shall seek to restrain,
      prohibit or invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
      that might affect the right of the Buyer to own the Shares or to own or
      operate the business of the Company after the Closing.

            6.13.    OPINIONS OF COUNSEL. The Buyer shall have received (a) an
      opinion of counsel to the Stockholder, which counsel shall be reasonably
      acceptable to the Buyer, dated as of the Closing Date, substantially in

                        with the normal practice of the Buyer and its
                        subsidiaries and with generally accepted accounting
                        principles, provided that Damages shall be deemed to
                        accrue under this clause (ii) only after the date that
                        is three months after the Closing Date, or (iii) failure

                  (c)   any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the

                        and all covenants, conditions, restrictions, voting
                        trust arrangements, liens, charges, encumbrances,
                        options and adverse claims or rights whatsoever; or

                  (e)   any claim by a former stockholder of the Company, or any
                        other person or entity, seeking to assert, or based

                        of stock of the Company; (ii) any rights of a
                        stockholder, including preemptive rights; (iii) any

                        Company; or (iv) any claim that his, her or its shares
                        were wrongfully repurchased by the Company.

            8.2.     REDUCTION CLAIMS

                     (a) If the Buyer is entitled, or seeks to assert rights,
            to a Price Reduction pursuant to this Section 8, it shall give
            written notification to the Stockholder of the commencement of any
            suit or proceeding by a person or entity other than a party hereto
            for which a reduction is sought (a "Third Party Action"). Such
            notification shall be given within 20 days after receipt by the
            Buyer of notice of such Third Party Action, and shall describe in
            reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Buyer) the facts
            constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and the amount of
            the claimed damages; provided, however, that no delay or failure on
            the part of the Buyer in so notifying the Stockholder shall relieve
            the Stockholder of any obligation to reduce the Purchase Price
            hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused by
            or arising out of such failure. Within 20 days after delivery of
            such notification, the Stockholder may, upon written notice thereof
            to the Buyer, assume control of the defense of such Third Party
            Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer; provided
            that (i) the Stockholder may only assume control of such defense if
            (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Buyer that any damages, fines,
            costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Buyer in
            connection with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for which
            the Buyer shall be entitled to a Price Reduction pursuant to this
            Section 8 and (B) the ad damnum is less than or equal to the amount
            of Damages for which the Purchase Price is to be reduced pursuant to
            this Section 8 and (ii) the Stockholder may not assume control of
            the defense of a Third Party Action involving criminal liability or
            in which equitable relief is sought against the Buyer. If the
            Stockholder does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to,
            so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the Buyer
            shall control such defense. The party not controlling the defense of
            the Third Party Action (the "Non-controlling Party") may participate
            in such defense at its own expense. The party controlling such
            defense (the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-controlling
            Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the
            defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations
            made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The
            Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such
            information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action
            (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which
            may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand,
            invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same)
            and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party
            in the defense of such Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of
            counsel to the Buyer with respect to a Third Party Action shall be
            considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement if (i) the Buyer
            controls the defense of such Third Party Action pursuant to the
            terms of this paragraph (a) of Subsection 8.2 or (ii) the
            Stockholder assumes control of such defense and the Buyer reasonably
            concludes that the Stockholder and the Buyer have conflicting
            interests or different defenses available with respect to such Third
            Party Action. The Stockholder shall not agree to any settlement of,
            or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Action
            without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be
            unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the
            consent of the Buyer shall not be required if the Stockholder agrees
            in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or
            judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release
            of the Buyer from further liability and has no other adverse effect
            on the Buyer. The Buyer shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
            entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action
            without the prior written consent of the Stockholder, which shall
            not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

                   (b) In order to seek a Price Reduction pursuant to this
            Section 8, the Buyer shall deliver to the Stockholder and the Escrow
            Agent written notification (a "Claim Notice") that contains (i) a
            description of the Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be
            incurred by the Buyer or the Company and the amount of such Damages
            (the "Claimed Amount"), to the extent then known, (ii) a statement
            that the Buyer is entitled to a Price Reduction pursuant to this
            Section 8 for such Damages and a reasonable explanation of the basis
            therefor, and (iii) a demand for payment in the amount of such
            Damages.

                   (c) Within 20 days after delivery of a Claim Notice (unless
            such Claim Notice is delivered pursuant to paragraph (a) of
            Subsection 8.1, in which case within two business days after
            delivery of such Claim Notice), the Stockholder shall deliver to the
            Buyer a written response (the "Response") in which the Stockholder
            shall: (i) agree that the Buyer is entitled to receive a Price
            Reduction equal to the Claimed Amount, in which case the Stockholder
            and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, within three days
            following the delivery of the Response, a written notice executed by
            both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute the Claimed
            Amount from the Escrow Account to the Buyer or the Company, as
            contemplated by paragraph (g) of this Subsection 8.2; (ii) agree
            that the Buyer is entitled to receive a Price Reduction equal to a
            part (the "Agreed Amount"), but not all, of the Claimed Amount, in
            which case the Stockholder and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow
            Agent, within three days following the delivery of the Response, a
            written notice executed by both parties instructing the Escrow Agent
            to distribute the Agreed Amount from the Escrow Account to the Buyer
            or the Company, as contemplated by paragraph (g) of this Subsection
            8.2; or (iii) dispute that the Buyer is entitled to receive a Price
            Reduction for any of the Claimed Amount.

                   (d) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a
            Response that reflects a dispute by the Stockholder of its liability
            for a Price Reduction for all or a part of the Claimed Amount (a
            "Dispute"), the Stockholder and the Buyer shall use good faith
            efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved
            within such 30-day period, the Stockholder and the Buyer shall
            discuss in good faith the submission of the Dispute to binding
            arbitration, and if the Stockholder and the Buyer agree in writing
            to submit the Dispute to such arbitration, then the provisions of
            paragraph (e) of this Subsection 8.2 shall become effective with
            respect to such Dispute. The provisions of this paragraph (d) shall
            not obligate the Stockholder and the Buyer to submit to arbitration
            or any other alternative dispute resolution procedure with respect
            to any Dispute, and in the absence of an agreement by the
            Stockholder and the Buyer to arbitrate a Dispute, such Dispute shall
            be resolved in a state or federal court sitting in the State of New
            Jersey, in accordance with Subsection 11.6. The Stockholder and the
            Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, promptly following the
            resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement, arbitration,
            judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both
            parties instructing the Escrow Agent as to the amount that shall be
            distributed to the Buyer or the Company, as contemplated by
            paragraph (g) of this Subsection 8.2 (which notice shall be
            consistent with the terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

                   (e)    If, as set forth in paragraph (d) of this Subsection
            8.2, the Buyer and the Stockholder agree to submit any Dispute to
            binding arbitration, the arbitration shall be conducted by a single
            arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") in accordance with the Commercial
            Rules in effect from time to time and the following provisions:

                          (i) In the event of any conflict between the
                   Commercial Rules in effect from time to time and the
                   provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this
                   Agreement shall prevail and be controlling.

<PAGE>

                          (ii) The parties shall commence the arbitration by
                   jointly filing a written submission with the Newark, New
                   Jersey office of the American Arbitration Association in
                   accordance with Commercial Rule 5 (or any successor
                   provision).

                          (iii) No depositions or other discovery shall be
                   conducted in connection with the arbitration.

                          (iv)  Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of
                   the arbitration hearing, the Arbitrator shall prepare and
                   distribute to the parties a writing setting forth the
                   arbitral award and the Arbitrator's reasons therefor. Any
                   award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive
                   and binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon may be
                   entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction
                   (subject to Subsection 11.6), provided that the Arbitrator
                   shall have no power or authority to (x) award damages in
                   excess of the portion of the Claimed Amount that is subject
                   to such Dispute, (y) award multiple, consequential, punitive
                   or exemplary damages, or (z) grant injunctive relief,
                   specific performance or other equitable relief.

                          (v) The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority,
                   under the Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or
                   disregard any provision of this Agreement, including the
                   provisions of paragraph (e) of this Subsection 8.3, or (y)
                   address or resolve any issue not submitted by the parties.

                          (vi) In connection with any arbitration proceeding
                   pursuant to this Agreement, each party shall bear its own
                   costs and expenses, except that the fees and costs of the
                   American Arbitration Association and the Arbitrator, the
                   costs and expenses of obtaining the facility where the
                   arbitration hearing is held, and such other costs and
                   expenses as the Arbitrator may determine to be directly
                   related to the conduct of the arbitration and appropriately
                   borne jointly by the parties (which shall not include any
                   party's attorneys' fees or costs, witness fees (if any),
                   costs of investigation and similar expenses) shall be shared
                   equally by the Buyer and the Stockholder.

                  (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Subsection
            8.2, if a third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit)
            that the Buyer is liable to such third party for a monetary or
            other obligation that may constitute or result in Damages for which
            the Buyer may be entitled to a Price Reduction pursuant to this
            Section 8, and the Buyer reasonably determines that it has a
            valid business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) the
            Buyer shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without
            prior notice to or consent from the Stockholder, (ii) the Buyer may
            subsequently make a claim for a Price Reduction in accordance with
            the provisions of this Section 8, and (iii) the Buyer shall be
            reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8,
            for any such Damages for which it is entitled to a Price Reduction
            pursuant to this Section 8 (subject to the right of the Stockholder
            to dispute the Buyer's entitlement to a Price Reduction, or the
            amount for which the Buyer is entitled to a Price Reduction, under
            the terms of this Section 8).

                  (g) It is understood that, pursuant to the provisions of
            Subsection 8.1, a Price Reduction may result from Damages that are
            incurred by or attributable to the Company and that result in
            economic harm to the Buyer solely as the result of its status as a
            stockholder of the Company. In such an event, the parties agree
            that it is in their mutual best interests for the repayment of any
            such Price Reduction to be made to the Company, rather than the
            Buyer. In no event shall any reduction in the amount of any Damages
            or any Price Reduction and Damages be made to reflect the fact that
            the Buyer owns less than all of the outstanding capital stock of
            the Company.

            8.3.  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
     representations and warranties that are covered by agreements in
     paragraphs (a) and (b) of Subsection 8.1 shall (a) survive the Closing and
     (b) shall expire one year after the Closing Date. If the Buyer delivers to
     the Stockholder, before expiration of a representation or warranty, either
     a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or warranty, or a
     notice that, as a result of a legal proceeding instituted by or written
     claim made by a third party, the Buyer reasonably expects to incur Damages
     for which it is entitled to a Price Reduction under this Section 8 based
     upon a breach of such representation or warranty (an "Expected Claim
     Notice"), then the applicable representation or warranty shall survive
     until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by
     such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which
     an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or
     resolved in favor of the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly so notify the
     Stockholder; and if the Buyer has delivered a copy of the Expected Claim
     Notice to the Escrow Agent and funds have been retained in the Escrow
     Account after the Termination Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement)
     with respect to such Expected Claim Notice, the Stockholder and the Buyer
     shall promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by
     both parties instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such retained funds
     to the Stockholder in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
     The rights to a Price Reduction set forth in this Section 8 shall not be
     affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Buyer or
     any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by the Buyer, whether
     before or after the date of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with
     respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any representation,
     warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of a Price Reduction
     hereunder or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing condition relating
     to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the performance of or
     compliance with agreements and covenants.

            8.4. LIMITATIONS

                 (a)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein:

                      (i)     the aggregate Price Reduction for Damages under
                              this Section 8 shall not exceed the amount of
                              funds contained in the Escrow Account;

                      (ii)    no Price Reduction shall be made under this
                              Section 8 with respect to a claim pursuant to
                              clause (i) of paragraph (b) of Subsection 8.1
                              (other than a claim relating to a breach of the
                              representations and warranties set forth in
                              Subsections 2.4, 2.5 and 3.2) unless and until the
                              aggregate Damages with respect to claims pursuant
                              to clause (i) of paragraph (b) of Subsection 8.1
                              (other than as aforesaid) exceed $1,000,000;

                      (iii)   the Price Reduction for Damages under clause (iii)
                              of paragraph (b) of Subsection 8.1 shall be
                              reduced to the extent that any Closing Receivables
                              that were the subject of a Price Reduction under
                              clause (ii) of such paragraph (b) are subsequently
                              collected prior to the fifth business day
                              preceding the first anniversary of the Closing
                              Date; and

                      (iv)    the aggregate Price Reduction for Damages under
                              clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph (b) of
                              Subsection 8.1 (as adjusted pursuant to the
                              preceding clause (iii)) shall not exceed an amount
                              equal to 25 percent of the total Closing
                              Receivables.

      For purposes solely of determining the amount of Damages pursuant to this
      Section 8 (and not for purposes of determining the existence of a breach
      of a representation or warranty), all representations and warranties of
      the Stockholder and the Company in Sections 2 and 3 shall be

                                     - 36 -
<PAGE>

      construed as if the terms "Company MAE," "material" and variations thereof
      were omitted from such representations and warranties.

                  (b) The Escrow Agreement shall be the exclusive means for the
            Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is entitled to a Price
            Reduction under this Section 8.

                  (c) Except with respect to claims based on fraud, after the
            Closing, the rights of the Buyer under this Section 8 and the Escrow
            Agreement shall be the exclusive remedy of the Buyer with respect to
            claims against the Stockholder or the Company resulting from or
            relating to any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to
            perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

                  (d) The Stockholder shall not have any right of contribution
            against the Company with respect to any breach by the Company of any
            of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements. The
            amount of the Price Reduction recoverable by the Buyer under this
            Section 8 with respect to a Price Reduction shall be reduced by (i)
            any proceeds received by the Buyer or the Company, with respect to
            the Damages to which the Price Reduction relates, from an insurance
            carrier and (ii) the amount of any tax savings actually realized by
            the Buyer or the Company, for the tax year in which Damages were
            incurred, which are clearly attributable to the Damages to which
            such Price Reduction relates (net of any increased tax liability
            that may result from the receipt of the indemnity payment or any
            insurance proceeds relating to such Damages).

      9.    POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS. The Stockholder agrees that from and after
the Closing Date:

            9.1.  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

                  (a) The Stockholder and each of its affiliates (as such term
            is defined in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules
            and regulations promulgated thereunder) (individually, an
            "Affiliate" and collectively "Affiliates") shall hold in confidence
            and shall use their Reasonable Best Efforts to have all officers,
            directors and personnel who continue after the Closing to be
            employed by such Stockholder or any Affiliate thereof to hold in
            confidence all knowledge and information of a secret or confidential
            nature with respect to the business of the Company and not to
            disclose, publish or make use of the same without the consent of the
            Buyer, except to the extent that such information shall have become
            public knowledge other than by breach of this Agreement by the
            Stockholder.

                  (b) If (i) the employment of an officer, director or other
            employee of the Stockholder or any Affiliate thereof, to whom secret
            or confidential knowledge or information concerning the business of
            the Company has been disclosed, is terminated and (ii) such
            individual is subject to an obligation to maintain such knowledge or
            information in confidence after such termination, the Stockholder
            shall, upon request by the Buyer, take all reasonable steps at its
            expense to enforce such confidentiality obligation in the event of
            an actual or threatened breach thereof. Any legal counsel retained
            by the Stockholder in connection with any such enforcement or
            attempted enforcement shall be selected by the Stockholder, but
            shall be subject to the approval of the Buyer, which approval shall
            not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (c) The Stockholder agrees that the remedy at law for any
            breach of this Subsection 9.1 would be inadequate and that the Buyer
            shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other
            remedy it may have upon breach of any provision of this Subsection
            9.1.

                                     - 37 -

            9.2.   FURTHER ASSURANCES. At any time and from time to time after
     the Closing, at the Buyer's request and without further consideration,
     the Stockholder shall promptly execute and deliver such instruments of
     sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, and take all such
     other action as the Buyer may reasonably request, more effectively to
     transfer, convey and assign to the Buyer, and to confirm the Buyer's title
     to, the Shares, to assist the Buyer in exercising all rights with respect
     thereto and to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

            9.3.   NO SOLICITATION OR HIRING OF FORMER EMPLOYEES. Except as
     provided by law, for a period of one year after the Closing Date,
     neither the Stockholder nor any Affiliate thereof shall (a) solicit or
     otherwise induce any individual identified under the heading "Specified
     Employees" in the Supplemental Letter to terminate his or her employment or
     with the Buyer (or the Company) or to become an employee of the Stockholder
     or and Affiliate thereof or (b) hire any individual identified under the
     heading "Specified Employees" in the Supplemental Letter.

            9.4.   NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT

                   (a) For a period of five years after the Closing Date, the
            Stockholder shall not engage directly or indirectly in the
            ownership, management or operation of any health insurance or health
            benefit program, including any health maintenance organization,
            health care preferred provider organization or traditional indemnity
            program, offered to Medicaid beneficiaries through the State of New
            Jersey Medicaid managed care program or to beneficiaries through the
            Children's Health Insurance Program authorized under Title XXI of
            the Social Security Act, as amended, in the State of New Jersey (a
            "Competing Business"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, during such
            period the Stockholder shall be permitted to acquire, or make
            investments in, entities that constitute a Competing Business,
            provided that (i) the gross revenues of such entities' Competing
            Businesses are not material in the aggregate to Buyer, as Buyer's
            business is then conducted, and (ii) the Medicaid memberships of
            those entities' Competing Businesses in the Service Areas are not
            material in the aggregate to Buyer, as Buyer's business is then
            conducted.

                    (b) The parties hereto agree that the duration and
            geographic scope of the non-competition provision set forth in this
            Subsection 9.4 are reasonable. In the event that any court of
            competent jurisdiction determines that the duration or the
            geographic scope, or both, are unreasonable and that such provision
            is to that extent unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the
            provision shall remain in full force and effect for the greatest
            time period and in the greatest area that would not render it
            unenforceable. The parties intend that this non-competition
            provision shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants, one
            for each and every county of each and every state of the United
            States of America and each and every political subdivision of each
            and every country outside the United States of America where this
            provision is intended to be effective. The Stockholder agrees that
            damages are an inadequate remedy for any breach of this provision
            and that the Buyer shall, whether or not it is pursuing any
            potential remedies at law, be entitled to equitable relief in the
            form of preliminary and permanent injunctions without bond or other
            security upon any actual or threatened breach of this
            non-competition provision.

     10.    TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

            10.1.  TERMINATION BY LAPSE OF TIME. This Agreement shall terminate
     at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on January 1, 2003, if the transactions
     contemplated hereby have not been consummated, unless such date is
     extended by the written consent of the Company, the Buyer and the
     Stockholder.

     there shall occur a breach of any of the representations, warranties or
     covenants of the Buyer or the failure by the Buyer to perform any condition
     or obligation hereunder, and may be terminated by the Buyer, if at any time

     communication hereunder using any other means (including personal
     delivery, expedited courier, messenger service, telecopy, telex, ordinary
     mail or electronic mail), but no such notice, request, demand, claim or

           respect to any condition, default or breach of covenant hereunder
           shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent condition,

           rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

           11.4.  SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is invalid,
     illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
     jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality
     or unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions
     hereof in such jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of
     this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction.

           11.5.  INVESTIGATION OF THE PARTIES. All representations and
     warranties contained herein that are made to the best knowledge of a
     party shall require that such party make reasonable investigation and
     inquiry with respect thereto to ascertain the correctness and validity

     proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) waives any

     claim of inconvenient forum or other challenge to venue in such court, (d)
     agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
     this Agreement in any other court and (e) waives any right it may have to a

     to any arbitration of a Dispute, the Arbitrator shall resolve all threshold
     issues relating to the validity and applicability of the arbitration
     provisions of this Agreement, contract validity applicability of statutes
     of limitations and issue preclusion, and such threshold issues shall not be
     heard or determined by such court.

     construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey.

           11.8.    CONSTRUCTION

                    (a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
           be the language chosen by the parties to express their mutual intent,
           and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any
           party.

                    (b) The headings of the Sections and Subsections of this
           Agreement are included only for convenience and shall not affect the

                    (c) References herein to Sections and Subsections shall
            mean such Sections and Subsections of this Agreement, except as
            otherwise specified. The words "herein" and "hereof" and other words
            of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
            particular part of this Agreement. The word "including" as used
            herein shall not be construed so as to exclude any other thing not

            shall not be included; the last day of the period so computed shall
            be included, unless it is not a business day, in which event the
            period shall run until the end of the next day that is a business
            day. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "business day" shall
            mean the day that is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a statutory or

            of this Agreement shall prevail.

     counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
     which shall constitute one and the same document.
