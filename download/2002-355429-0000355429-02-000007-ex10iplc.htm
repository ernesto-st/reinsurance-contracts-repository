<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4.
Separate Commitments of Lenders. Borrower acknowledges that each Lender&#146;s
commitment to fund its portion of the Loans is made by each Lender severally,
and neither Agent nor any Lender shall be liable for the failure of another
Lender to timely perform under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.
Advances of Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
Borrower may borrow, repay and reborrow Loans under the Revolving Credit Loan,
provided that the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Loan
shall not at any time exceed the amounts permitted under Section 2.1 above.
Loans shall be disbursed as follows: </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1    Loans Advanced Pursuant to Borrowing Notices.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1(a)
Applicability. Loans (other than the Swingline Loan) may be LIBOR Loans, Prime
Rate Loans, or a combination thereof, and the funding thereof shall be subject
to this Section 2.5.1. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1(b)
Borrowing Notices. As long as Borrower meets the conditions for funding stated
in this Agreement, Borrower may submit requests for Loans (&#147;Borrowing
Notices&#148;) to Agent. All requests shall be made in writing (or by telephone,
subject to such security procedures as Agent may require from time to time,
provided that all telephonic notices shall be confirmed by written Borrowing
Notices within one (1) Business Day) and shall specify the proposed disbursement
date for the requested Loan; the amount of the Loan; the purpose of the Loan
(characterized in accordance with Section 2.2 above); the type of Loan, i.e.,
LIBOR Loan or Prime Rate Loan; and if a LIBOR Loan, the designated Interest
Period. Each Borrowing Notice shall irrevocably obligate Borrower to accept the
Loan requested thereby. Borrowing Notices shall be in the form of Exhibit
2.5.1(b) hereto or such other form as Agent may from time to time require. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1(c)
Funding of Loans. Lenders shall fund their respective portions of requested
Loans on the next following Business Day after the Business Day of Agent&#146;s
receipt of the Borrowing Notice, in the case of Prime Rate Loans, and on the
second (2nd) Business Day following the Business Day of Agent&#146;s receipt of
the Borrowing Notice, in the case of LIBOR Loans. All funds shall be disbursed
directly into an account maintained by the Borrower with Agent. Borrower agrees
that if any Lender elects to fund any requested Loan(s) sooner after requested
than is required hereunder, the Lender may nevertheless use the entire response
period allowed hereunder upon receipt of any subsequent request, at the
Lender&#146;s sole option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1(d)
Prime Rate Loan Limitations. Individual Prime Rate Loans shall be in the minimum

<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1(e)
LIBOR Loan Limitations. Individual LIBOR Loans shall be in the minimum amount of
Three Million and No/100 Dollars ($3,000,000.00) each (and in multiples of
$1,000,000 if in excess thereof). No more than four (4) LIBOR Loans may be
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Loan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.1(f)
Additional Limitation on LIBOR Interest Periods. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if an Unmatured Default or a Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, no additional LIBOR Loans may be created or
continued and no Prime Rate Loan may be converted into a LIBOR Loan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.2
Conversion of Loans. The Borrower shall have the right, on prior irrevocable
written notice to Agent given two (2) Business Days prior to the date of any
requested conversion, to convert any Prime Rate Loan or LIBOR Loan into a Loan
of another type, or to continue any LIBOR Loan for another Interest Period,
subject in each case to the following: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.2(a)
Application of Loans. Each conversion shall be effected by applying the proceeds
of the new LIBOR Loan and/or Prime Rate Loan, as the case may be, to the Loan
(or portion thereof) being converted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.2(b)
Notices of Conversions. Each notice pursuant to this 2.5.2(b) shall be
irrevocable and shall refer to this Agreement and specify the identity and
principal amount of the particular Loan that the Borrower requests be converted
or continued; if such notice requests conversion, the date of such conversion
(which shall be a Business Day); and if a Loan is to be converted to a LIBOR
Loan or a LIBOR Loan is to be continued, the Interest Period with respect
thereto. No LIBOR Loan shall be converted at any time other than at the end of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, except in accordance with Section 2.12
hereof. Conversion notices shall be in the form attached as Exhibit 2.5.1(b)
hereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.3
Absence of Election. If the Borrower fails to give Agent notice to continue any
LIBOR Loan for a subsequent period, such LIBOR Loan (unless repaid) shall
automatically be converted into a Prime Rate Loan. If the Borrower fails to
specify in any Borrowing Notice the type of borrowing or, in the case of a LIBOR
Loan, the applicable Interest Period, the Borrower will be deemed to have
requested a Prime Rate Loan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.4
Implied Representations Upon Request for Loan. Upon making any request for any
Loan, Borrower shall be deemed to have warranted to Agent and Lenders that all
conditions to funding set forth in Article III hereof are satisfied. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.5.5
Advance Not Waiver. Any Lender&#146;s making of any Loan that it is not
obligated to be made under any provision of Article III hereof or any other
provision hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of the Lenders&#146; right
to withhold future Loans, declare a Default, or otherwise demand strict
compliance with this Agreement, acting through Agent as permitted by the terms
hereof. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.     Interest.  Interest shall accrue on each Loan as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.1
Prime Rate Loans. Interest shall accrue on each Prime Rate Loan at an annual
rate equal to the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Prime Rate Margin, said rate to
change contemporaneously with any change in the Prime Rate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.2
LIBOR Loans. Interest shall accrue on each LIBOR Loan at a rate equal to the
LIBOR Rate for the selected Interest Period plus the Applicable LIBOR Rate
Margin. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.3
Additional Interest on LIBOR Loans. In addition to the interest described above,
Borrower shall pay to Lenders, if and so long as Lenders shall be required under
regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including LIBOR
Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR
Loan, from the date of such advance until said principal amount is paid in full,
at an interest rate per annum equal at all times to the remainder obtained by
subtracting (i) the LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period from (ii) the rate
obtained by dividing the LIBOR Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the
LIBOR Rate Reserve Percentage for such Interest Period. This additional interest
shall be payable on each date on which interest is payable. The amount of
additional interest shall be determined by each Lender, who shall notify
Borrower and Agent thereof and whose determination shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.4
Calculation of Interest. Interest for both Prime Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year counting the actual number of
days elapsed. Interest shall accrue on the Business Day a Loan is extended and
shall accrue through the Business Day prior to the Business Day on which it is
repaid. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.5
Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Default
and during the continuation of such Default, interest shall be charged at the
Default Rate, regardless of whether Lenders have elected to exercise any other
remedies available to Lenders, including, without limitation, acceleration of
the maturity of the outstanding principal of the Revolving Credit Loan. All such
interest shall be paid without demand on the Interest Payment Dates applicable
to Prime Rate Loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.6
Payment of Interest. Interest for Prime Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans shall be due
and payable in arrears, without notice, on each Interest Payment Date. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.6.7
Usury Savings Provision. It is the intention of the parties that all charges
under or in connection with this Agreement and the Obligations, however
denominated, and including (without limitation) all interest, commitment fees,
late charges and loan charges, shall be limited to the Maximum Lawful Amount.
Such charges hereunder shall be characterized and all provisions of the Credit
Documents shall be construed as to uphold the validity of charges provided for
therein to the fullest possible extent. Additionally, all charges hereunder
shall be spread over the full permitted term of the Obligations for the purpose
of determining the effective rate thereof to the fullest possible extent,
without regard to prepayment of or the right to prepay the Obligations. If for
any reason whatsoever, however, any charges paid or contracted to be paid in
respect of the Obligations shall exceed the Maximum Lawful Amount, then, without
any specific action by Lenders, Agent or Borrower, the obligation to pay such
interest and/or other charges shall be reduced to the Maximum Lawful Amount in
effect from time to time and any amounts collected by Lenders that exceed the
Maximum Lawful Amount shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance
of the Obligations and/or refunded to Borrower so that at no time shall the
interest or loan charges paid or payable in respect of the Obligations exceed
the Maximum Lawful Amount. This provision shall control every other provision
herein and in any and all other agreements and instruments now existing or
hereafter arising between Borrower and Lenders with respect to the Obligations. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.7.
Alternate Rate of Interest if LIBOR Unavailable. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the date of commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR
Loan, a Lender shall have determined (i) that dollar deposits in the amount of
the requested principal amount of such LIBOR Loan are not generally available in
the London Interbank Market; (ii) that the rate at which such dollar deposits
are being offered will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lender
of making or maintaining such LIBOR Loan during such Interest Period; or
(iii)&#160;that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate,
such Lender shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written or telephonic
notice of such determination to Borrower. In the event of any such
determination, any request by Borrower for a LIBOR Loan under this Agreement
shall, until the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, be
deemed to be a request for a Prime Rate Loan. Each determination by such Lender
hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8      Change in Circumstances.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8.1
Imposition of Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after
the date of this Agreement any change in applicable Laws or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the
force of law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to a Lender under
any LIBOR Loan made by the Lender or any other fees or amounts payable hereunder
(other than taxes imposed on the overall net income, gross receipts or added
value of a Lender by the country in which the Lender is located, or by the
jurisdiction in which a Lender has its principal office, or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority therein), or shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve requirement, special deposit, insurance charge (including
FDIC insurance on LIBOR Liabilities) or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, a Lender or shall
impose on a Lender or the London Interbank Market any other condition affecting
this Agreement or LIBOR Loans made by a Lender, and the result of any of the
foregoing shall be to increase the cost to the Lender of making or maintaining
its LIBOR Loan or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by a
Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect
thereof by an amount deemed by the affected Lender to be material, then Borrower
will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the
Lender for such additional costs of reduction. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8.2
Other Changes. If either (i) the introduction of, or any change in, or in the
interpretation of, any United States or foreign Law; or (ii) compliance with any
directive, guidelines or request from any central bank or other United States or
foreign Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law)
promulgated or made after the date hereof, affects or would affect the amount of
capital required or expected to be maintained by a Lender (or any lending office
of a Lender) or any corporation directly or indirectly owning or controlling a
Lender (or any lending office of a Lender) based upon the existence of this
Agreement, and the Lender shall have determined that such introduction, change
or compliance has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
Lender&#146;s capital or on the capital of such owning or controlling
corporation as a consequence of its obligations hereunder (including its
commitment) to a level below that which the Lender or such owning or controlling
corporation could have achieved but for such introduction, change or compliance
(after taking into account that Lender&#146;s policies or the policies of such
owning or controlling corporation, as the case may be, regarding capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Lender (in its sole discretion) to be
material, then, from time to time, Borrower shall pay to the Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender for such reduction
attributable to making, funding and maintaining its commitment and Loans
hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8.3
Computation of Amounts. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the basis and
method of computation of such amount or amounts specified in Section 2.11 hereof
as shall be necessary to compensate the Lender (or its participating banks) as
specified above, as the case may be, shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be
conclusive absent manifest error; provided however, that Borrower shall be
responsible for compliance herewith and the payment of increased costs only to
the extent that (i) any change in Laws giving rise to increased costs occurs
after the date of this Agreement; and (ii) the Lender gives notice of the change
giving rise to increased costs within one hundred eighty (180) Business Days
after the Lender has, or with reasonable diligence should have had, knowledge of
the change, or else Lender can only collect costs from and after the date of the
notice. Subject to the foregoing, Borrower shall pay the affected Lender the
amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) Business Days after
its receipt of such certificate. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8.4
No Duty to Contest. The protection of this Section 2.8 shall be available to a
Lender regardless of any possible contention of invalidity or inapplicability of
the Law or condition that shall have been imposed. Should a Lender assess any
charge to Borrower under this Section&#160;2.8, and provided that Borrower pays
the assessment to the Lender, Borrower may thereafter undertake, at
Borrower&#146;s own expense any contest of the matters giving rise to the charge
that may, in the opinion of Borrower&#146;s independent counsel issued to the
affected Lender, and concurred in by counsel to the Lender, have a reasonable
chance of success, provided further that the contest would not require the
assertion of any position contrary to a position taken by the Lender generally
with taxing authorities or any other involved parties and that there does not
exist any other circumstance that would disadvantage the Lender in the event of
such contest, as the affected Lender may determine in its discretion. The
affected Lender shall offer reasonable participation to Borrower for the purpose
of enabling Borrower to pursue the contest of such issue, with all expenses,
including fees and expenses of the affected Lender&#146;s counsel, to be paid by
Borrower. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.8.5
Replacement Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or
in any other Credit Document, upon the occurrence of any event that obligates
the Borrower to pay any amount under Section 2.8 with respect to any Lender, the
Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Unmatured Default then exists or
will exist immediately after giving effect to the respective replacement, to
replace such Lender (the &#147;Replaced Lender&#148;) by designating another
Lender or an eligible assignee under Section 9.2 (such Lender or eligible
assignee being herein called a &#147;Replacement Lender&#148;) to which such
Replaced Lender shall assign, in accordance with Section 9.2 and without
recourse to or warranty by, or expense to, such Replaced Lender, all of the
rights and obligations of such Replaced Lender hereunder and, upon such
assignment, such Replaced Lender shall no longer be a party hereto or have any
rights hereunder (except for such rights as survive repayment of the Loans), and
such Replacement Lender shall succeed to the rights and obligations of such
Replaced Lender hereunder. The Borrower shall pay to such Replaced Lender in
same day funds on the date of replacement all interest, fees and other amounts
then due and owing such Replaced Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and
including the date of replacement, including, without limitation, costs incurred
under Section 2.8. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or
implied above, no Lender shall be obligated hereunder to become a Replacement
Lender. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.9.
Change in Legality of LIBOR Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein contained, if any change in any Law or in interpretation thereof by any
Governmental Authority charged with the administration or interpretation thereof
shall make it unlawful for a Lender to make or maintain any LIBOR Loan or to
give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby, then, by written notice
to Borrower, the Lender may (i) declare that LIBOR Loans will not thereafter be
made by the Lender hereunder, whereupon Borrower shall be prohibited from
requesting LIBOR Loans from the Lender hereunder unless such declaration is
subsequently withdrawn; and (ii) require that all outstanding LIBOR Loans made
by it be converted to Prime Rate Loans, in which event (a) all such LIBOR Loans
shall be automatically converted to Prime Rate Loans (but without imposition of
any additional charge that would normally become due under Section 2.8 hereof)
as of the effective date of such notice, and (b) all payments and prepayments of
principal that would otherwise have been applied to repay the converted LIBOR
Loans shall instead be applied to repay the Prime Rate Loans resulting from the
conversion of such LIBOR Loans. For purposes of this Section 2.9, a notice to
Borrower by the Lender pursuant to (a) above shall be effective, if lawful, on
the last day of the then current Interest Period; in all other cases, such
notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by Borrower. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.10.
Principal Repayment. All remaining principal outstanding under the Revolving
Credit Loan shall become due on the Termination Date or the earlier acceleration
of the Revolving Credit Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
During the continuance of any Default, all prepayments shall be applied, first,
to the Swing Line Loans, and second, after payment in full of the Swing Line
Loans, to the Revolving Credit Loans. In the absence of a Default, voluntary
prepayments pursuant to this Agreement shall be applied as the Borrower
determines. Revolving Credit Loans and Swing Line Loans prepaid pursuant to this
Agreement may be reborrowed, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Each prepayment of the Revolving Credit Loans made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be applied to reduce the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of the Revolving Credit Loans, ratably among the Lenders holding Revolving
Credit Loans in proportion to the principal amount held by each. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.11.    Prepayment of LIBOR Loans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.11.1
Notice of LIBOR Loan Prepayment. Borrower may, upon two (2) Business Days&#146;
prior written notice to Agent, and upon payment of all applicable premiums set
forth in Section&#160;2.11.3 hereof, prepay any outstanding LIBOR Loans prior to
any Interest Payment Date for such LIBOR Loans, in whole or in part. Each notice
of prepayment of any LIBOR Loan shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment and shall be irrevocable. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.11.2
Amount of LIBOR Loan Prepayment. Each partial prepayment of any LIBOR Loan shall
be in an aggregate principal amount which is the lesser of (i) the then
outstanding principal balance of the one or more LIBOR Loans to be prepaid, or
(ii) Three Million and No/100 Dollars ($3,000,000.00) or an integral multiple
thereof. Interest on the amount prepaid accrued to the prepayment date shall be
paid on such date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.11.3
LIBOR Loan Prepayment Premium. Upon prepayment of any LIBOR Loan on a date other
than the relevant Interest Payment Date for such borrowing, Borrower shall pay
to Lenders, in addition to all other payments then due and owing Lenders,
premiums which shall be equal to an amount, if any, reasonably determined by
Agent to be the difference between the rate of interest then applicable to the
relevant LIBOR Loan and the yield Lenders would receive upon reinvestment of so
much of the relevant LIBOR Loans as is prepaid for the remainder of the term of
the relevant LIBOR Loan or Loans. Anything in this Section 2.11.3 to the
contrary notwithstanding, the premiums payable upon any such prepayment shall
not exceed the amount, if any, determined by Agent to be the difference between
the rate of interest then applicable to the relevant LIBOR Loan and the yield
that Lenders could receive upon reinvestment in the &#147;Floor
Reinvestment&#148; of so much of the relevant LIBOR Loan as is prepaid for the
remainder of the term of the relevant LIBOR Loan. For purposes hereof,
&#147;Floor Reinvestment&#148; shall mean an investment for the time period from
the date of such prepayment to the end of the relevant Interest Period
applicable to such LIBOR Loan at an interest rate per annum equal to the federal
funds &#147;offered&#148; rate as published in the Wall Street Journal on the
date of such prepayment. All determinations, estimates, assumptions, allocations
and the like required for the determination of such premiums shall be made by
Agent in good faith and shall be presumed correct absent manifest error. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.12.
Prepayment of Prime Rate Loans. Borrower may at any time prepay any outstanding
Prime Rate Loans prior to the Termination Date in whole or in part without
premium or penalty on one (1) Business Day&#146;s notice in a minimum amount of
$500,000 or any incremental multiple of $100,000. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.13.    Fixed  Commitment  Fees. Upon the execution of this Agreement,  Borrower shall pay commitment
fees to AmSouth and the other  Lenders,  in the amounts  previously  agreed to by the Borrower and the Lenders.
These commitment fees are not refundable or proratable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.14.
Periodic Facility Fee. Borrower shall pay to Agent for distribution to Lenders
Pro Rata a facility fee determined by applying the Applicable Facility Fee to
the total Revolving Credit Commitment. The facility fee shall be paid in arrears

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.    Swingline  Loans.  The Swingline  Lender hereby agrees to extend to Borrower  Swingline Loans

and conditions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.1
Use of Proceeds of Swingline Loans. Borrower may use the proceeds of Swingline
Loans for any purpose permitted for the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loan
under Section 2.2 of this Agreement. Swingline Loans shall be applied to reduce
the amount of the Revolving Credit Loan. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.2   Swingline Note.  The Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by the Swingline Note.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.3   Funding of Swingline Loans Advanced Pursuant to Borrowing Notices.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.3(a)
Applicability. Except for Swingline Loans made pursuant to Account Agreements as
provided in Section 2.16.4 hereof, the funding of Swingline Loans shall be
subject to this Section 2.16.3. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.3(b)
Borrowing Notices. As long as Borrower meets the conditions for funding stated
in this Agreement, the Borrower may submit requests for Swingline Loans
(&#147;Swingline Borrowing Notices&#148;) to the Swingline Lender. All requests
shall be made in writing (or by telephone, subject to such security procedures
as the Swingline Lender may require from time to time, provided that all
telephonic notices shall be confirmed by written Swingline Borrowing Notices
within one (1) Business Day) and shall specify the proposed date of the
requested disbursement and the aggregate amount of such disbursement. Each
Swingline Borrowing Notice shall irrevocably obligate Borrower to accept the
Swingline Loan requested thereby. Swingline Borrowing Notices shall be in such
form as the Swingline Lender may from time to time require. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.3(c)
Funding of Swingline Loans. The Swingline Lender shall fund Swingline Loans on
the Business Day following the Business Day of the Swingline Lender&#146;s
receipt of the Swingline Borrowing Notice. All funds shall be disbursed directly
into an account maintained by Borrower with the Swingline Lender. Borrower
agrees that if the Swingline Lender elects to fund any requested Swingline
Loan(s) sooner after requested than is required hereunder, the Swingline Lender
may nevertheless use the entire response period allowed hereunder upon receipt
of any subsequent request, at its sole option. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.4
Funding of Swingline Loans Advanced Pursuant to Cash Management Accounts.
Borrower may have in effect from time to time separate agreements with the
Swingline Lender or its affiliates (&#147;Account Agreements&#148;) establishing
cash management procedures that may involve the automatic disbursement of
Swingline Loans. The Account Agreements may be established using standardized
forms that do not address the specific circumstances of the Swingline Loan. To
resolve potential inconsistencies between this Agreement and Account Agreements,
the terms of this Agreement and of Account Agreements shall relate to one
another as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.4(a)
Funding and Payment Procedures Controlled by Account Agreements. The Account
Agreements shall control this Agreement as to (i) Section 2.16.3 hereof
regarding funding procedures, and (ii) Interest Payment Dates, to the extent
that an Account Agreement may provide for such payment more frequently than
otherwise required under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.4(b)
Certain Provisions Controlled by this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision
of an Account Agreement to the contrary, except as provided above in Section
2.16.4(a) hereof, the provisions of this Agreement shall control any Account
Agreement to the extent that an Account Agreement may be inconsistent with this
Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.4(c)
Continuing Warranty Under Account Agreements. Because Account Agreements may
provide for the making of Swingline Loans without formal draw requests from
Borrower, Borrower agrees that Borrower&#146;s warranty under Section 2.16.5
hereof as to the satisfaction of all conditions to the right to receive
Swingline Loans shall be a continuing one during any period that such an Account
Agreement may be in effect. Therefore, any Swingline Loans funded by the
Swingline Lender pursuant to an Account Agreement after the failure of a
condition stated in Article III hereof shall be deemed made upon the affirmative
misrepresentation of Borrower unless the Swingline Lender has received written
notice of and waived the failed condition in writing. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.5
Implied Representations Upon Request for Swingline Loan. Upon making any request
for a Swingline Loan, Borrower shall be deemed to have warranted to the
Swingline Lender that all conditions to funding are satisfied as of the
submission of the request to the Swingline Lender. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.6
Advance Not Waiver. The Swingline Lender&#146;s making of any Swingline Loan
that it is not obligated to make under any provision of Article III hereof or
any other provision hereof shall not be construed as a waiver of the Swingline
Lender&#146;s right to withhold future Swingline Loans, notify Agent of a
Default, or otherwise demand strict compliance with this Agreement. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.7   Interest.  Interest shall be charged and paid on each Swingline Loan as follows:</FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.7(a)
Rate of Interest. Interest shall accrue on Swingline Loans at an annual rate
equal to the Prime Rate, said rate to change contemporaneously with any change
in the Prime Rate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.7(b)
Calculation of Interest. Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day
year counting the actual number of days elapsed. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.7(c)  Payment of Interest.  Interest  shall be due and payable in arrears  without notice on each
Interest Payment Date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.7(d)
Default Rate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of a Default
and during the continuation of such Default until it is cured or waived,
interest shall be charged at the Default Rate, regardless of whether the
Swingline Lender has elected to exercise any other remedies available to it,
including, without limitation, acceleration of the maturity of the outstanding
principal of the Swingline Loans. All such interest shall be paid at the time of
and as a condition precedent to the curing of any such Default to the extent any
right to cure is given in this Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.7(e)
Usury Savings Provision. It is the intention of the parties that all charges
under or in connection with this Agreement and the Obligations, however
denominated, and including (without limitation) all interest, commitment fees,
late charges and loan charges, shall be limited to the Maximum Lawful Amount.
Such charges hereunder shall be characterized and all provisions of the Credit
Documents shall be construed as to uphold the validity of charges provided for
therein. If for any reason whatsoever, however, any charges paid or contracted
to be paid in respect of the Swingline Loans shall exceed the Maximum Lawful
Amount, then, ipso facto the obligation to pay such interest and/or other
charges shall be reduced to the Maximum Lawful Amount in effect from time to
time, and any amounts collected by Lender that exceed the Maximum Lawful Amount
shall be applied to the reduction of the principal balance of the Swingline
Loans and/or refunded to Borrower so that at no time shall the interest or loan
charges paid or payable in respect of the Swingline Loans exceed the Maximum
Lawful Amount. This provision shall control every other provision herein and in
any and all other agreements and instruments now existing or hereafter arising
between Borrower and the Swingline Lender with respect to the Swingline Loans. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.8
Repayment of Principal. All remaining principal, interest and expenses
outstanding under the Swingline Loans shall become due in full on the
Termination Date or the earlier acceleration of the Revolving Credit Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrower may at any time prepay the
interest or principal on any outstanding Swingline Loans in whole or in part
without premium or penalty. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.16.9
Procedures Among Lenders Upon Default. Upon the occurrence of a Default, Lenders
shall acquire participation interests in the outstanding Swingline Loans as
necessary to cause each Lender to own a Pro Rata interest in the outstanding
Swingline Loans, pursuant to such documentation as Agent may deem necessary. The
obligation of each Lender to acquire such a participation interest shall be
unconditional and, without limiting the foregoing, shall remain in effect
irrespective of (i) the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default, (ii) the
financial condition of Borrower, the Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other
Lender or (iii) the termination or cancellation of the Revolving Credit
Commitments (provided that such Swingline Loan was made prior to the date of
such termination or cancellation). The Swingline Loans shall thereafter be
administered by Lenders and Agent as though the Swingline Loans were amounts
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Loan. Additionally, to this end, upon the
occurrence and continuation of a Default, Agent may, in its discretion, and
without Borrower&#146;s consent, cause an advance to be made under the Revolving
Credit Loan sufficient to repay the outstanding Swingline Loans, even if a
Default is then outstanding. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.17.
Withholding Tax Exemption. Each Lender that is not incorporated or organized
under the laws of the United States of America, or a state thereof, shall, on or
before the date such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement, deliver to each
of the Borrower and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such
Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and such
Lender&#146;s Revolving Credit Note without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes. Each Lender that so delivers a Form 1001 or
4224 further undertakes to deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent two
additional copies of such form (or a successor form) on or before the date that
such form expires (currently, three successive calendar years for Form 1001 and
one calendar year for Form 4224), becomes obsolete or otherwise is required to
be resubmitted as a condition to obtaining an exemption from a required
withholding or deduction of United States federal income tax or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered
by it, and such amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, in each case certifying that
such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and such
Lender&#146;s Revolving Credit Note without deduction or withholding of any
United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without
limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred after the
Closing Date and prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be
required that renders all such forms inapplicable or that would prevent such
Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form with respect to it and
such Lender promptly advises the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable
of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States
federal income tax. </FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1.     Corporate  Existence and Standing.  Each of the Borrower and its Significant  Subsidiaries is
a corporation  duly  incorporated,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation  and has all  requisite  authority  to conduct  its  business in each  jurisdiction  in which its

Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the corporate power and authority
and legal right to execute and deliver the Credit Documents and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Credit
Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by proper corporate proceedings, and the Credit Documents constitute
legal, valid and binding obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with their terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors&#146; rights generally. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3.

instrument or agreement, other than such violations, conflicts or defaults
which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. No order, consent, approval, license,
authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with, or
exemption by, any Governmental Authority is required to authorize, or is

corporate restriction that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Significant Subsidiary is in
default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,
covenants or conditions contained in any agreement to which it is a party, which
default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Borrower nor any Significant Subsidiary is in default in the performance,
observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or conditions
contained in any agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.13.
Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Significant Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any Governmental Authority, having jurisdiction over the conduct
of their respective businesses or the ownership of their respective Property,

Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Significant Subsidiary has
received any notice to the effect that its operations are not in material
compliance with any of the requirements of applicable federal, state and local
environmental, health and safety statutes and regulations or the subject of any
federal or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed

<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2.3

accordance with Section 8.7 below, and (iv) otherwise administer the Loans
through the exercise of such of the powers granted herein as Agent deems
appropriate from time to time. Agent shall have no liability to Lenders for any
action or inaction relating to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents,
except for actual losses caused by its gross negligence or reckless or willful
misconduct. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.2
Limitations on Agent&#146;s Duties. Agent shall not be obligated to take any
action hereunder or under any other Credit Document (i) if such action would, in
the opinion of Agent, be contrary to applicable law, this Agreement or the other
Credit Documents, (ii) if it shall not first be specifically indemnified to its
satisfaction against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action, (iii) if it would
likely subject Agent to a tax in any jurisdiction where it is not then subject
to a tax, (iv) if it would likely require Agent to qualify to do business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, unless Agent receives security
or indemnity satisfactory to it against any tax or other liability in connection
with such qualification or resulting from the taking of such action in
connection therewith, or (v) if it would likely subject Agent to in personam
jurisdiction in any location where it is not then so subject. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.3
Agent&#146;s Right to Require Instructions in Performance of Duties. If Agent,
in its sole and absolute discretion, requests instructions from the Required
Lenders with respect to any act or action (including the failure to act) in
connection with this Agreement or any other Credit Document for which the
approval of the Required Lenders or all Lenders is not otherwise required, Agent
shall be entitled, at its option, to refrain from such action, or to continue
such inaction, unless and until Agent shall have received such instructions, and
Agent shall incur no liability by reason of so acting or refraining from action.
No Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of
Agent&#146;s acting or refraining from acting hereunder or under any other
Credit Document in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders in
such a case. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.4
Agent&#146;s Reliance on Others in Performance of Duties. Agent shall be
entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note,
writing, resolution, notice, statement, consent, certificate, telex, teletype or
facsimile message, order or other documentary, teletransmission or telephone
message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed, sent or made by the proper Person. Agent may consult with legal counsel
(including counsel for Borrower), accountants and other experts selected by it
with respect to all matters pertaining to this Agreement and the other Credit
Documents and its duties hereunder and thereunder and shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the advice of such counsel (including counsel for Borrower), accountants or
experts. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3.5
Sharing of Information. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article
VIII, Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, properties, financial or other
condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any other Person that may come
into its possession, whether before the making of the initial Loans or at any
time or times thereafter. All notices to be given to Borrower by a Lender
hereunder shall be concurrently given to Agent and all other Lenders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4.
Indemnification of Agent. To the extent Agent is not reimbursed by or on behalf
of Borrower, and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so, Lenders
will reimburse and indemnify Agent, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees and expenses) or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever that may at any time (including at any time following
the indefeasible repayment in full of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated thereby or any
action taken or omitted by Agent under or in connection with any of the
foregoing, and in particular will reimburse Agent for out-of-pocket expenses
promptly upon demand by Agent therefor; provided, however, that no Lender shall
be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction and not subject to any appeal or
pursuant to arbitration to have resulted from Agent&#146;s gross negligence or
reckless or willful misconduct. Agent may offset any amounts due Agent by any
Lender against obligations of Agent to that Lender. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5.
No Representations by Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that neither Agent nor any
of its officers, directors, employees, attorneys, accountants or agents has made
any representation or warranty to it regarding the Borrower, the Loans, or
otherwise relating to this Agreement. Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender for any recitals, statements, information, representations or warranties
herein or in any other Credit Document or in any document, instrument,
certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or therewith or
for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
perfection, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the financial condition of the Borrower or any other Person, or be
required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of
any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any other Person or the
existence or possible existence of any Unmatured Default or Default. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.6.
Independent Investigations by Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that,
independently and without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed and may deem appropriate, (i) it
has made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, properties, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of
the Borrower in connection with its decision to enter into this Agreement and
extend credit to Borrower hereunder, and (ii) it will continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
hereunder. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.7.
Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the
occurrence of any Unmatured Default or Default, other than any Unmatured Default
or Default arising out of the failure to pay any principal, interest, fees or
other amounts payable to Agent for the account of Lenders, unless Agent has
received written notice from Borrower or a Lender describing such Unmatured
Default or Default and stating that such notice is a &#147;notice of
default.&#148; In the event that Agent receives such a notice, Agent shall give
notice thereof to Lenders as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, however,
that if any such notice has also been furnished to Lenders, Agent shall have no
obligation to notify Lenders with respect thereto. Each Lender shall promptly
give Agent such a notice upon its actual knowledge of an Unmatured Default or a
Default; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to deliver such
notice in the absence of gross negligence or reckless or willful misconduct
shall not affect its rights hereunder or under the other Credit Documents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.8.
Funding of Loans Pursuant to Borrowing Notices. Promptly following receipt of
notice from Agent that a Borrowing Notice has been submitted, and provided that
all conditions to funding are believed to have been satisfied, each Lender shall
transfer to a designated account with Agent that Lender&#146;s Pro Rata Share of
the requested funding. The transfer of funds shall occur within the time
required for funding under this Agreement; provided, however, no Lender shall be
obligated to fund a LIBOR Loan earlier than two (2) Business Days after its
receipt of notice of the borrowing from Agent. Should any Lender fail to timely
fund its Pro Rata Share of a requested Loan, Agent may, but shall be under no
obligation whatsoever to, advance to Borrower the defaulted Lender&#146;s Pro
Rata Share of the requested Loan. If such an advance is made, it shall be deemed
an advance by Agent for the account of the defaulting Lender and shall bear
interest at the rate applicable to the Loan funded by the advance, payable on
demand. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.9.
Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to its Commitments, and the Loans
made by it, Agent shall have the same rights and powers under the Credit
Documents as any other Lender or holder of a Note and may exercise the same as
though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the terms
&#147;Lenders,&#148; &#147;Required Lenders,&#148; and any similar terms shall,
unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include Agent in its individual
capacity as a Lender. Agent may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory or other
business with the Borrower or any of their respective Affiliates as if it were
not performing the servicing duties specified herein, and may accept fees and
other consideration from Borrower for services in connection with this Agreement
and otherwise without having to disclose or account for the same to Lenders. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.10.
Holders. Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof
and Lender hereunder for all purposes hereof unless and until a written notice
of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof purportedly executed by the
payee, as the case may be, shall have been filed with Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person that, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note according to
Agent&#146;s information, shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent
holder, transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the case may be, of such Note or of
any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.11.
Successor Agent. Agent may resign at any time upon sixty (60) days&#146; prior
written notice to Borrower and Lenders. Agent may be removed upon Agent&#146;s
insolvency, liquidation or the appointment of a receiver for Agent, and by
action of the Required Lenders, at any time upon sixty (60) days&#146; prior
written notice to Borrower and Agent. Such resignation or removal, as the case
may be, shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Agent as provided
herein. The Required Lenders will appoint from among Lenders a successor Agent.
If no successor Agent shall have been appointed within such sixty (60) day
period, Agent may appoint, after consulting with Lenders and Borrower, a
successor agent from among Lenders, who shall serve as Agent until such time, if
any, as the Required Lenders shall have appointed a successor Agent as provided
hereinabove. Upon the written acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder
by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent,
and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents. After any retiring Agent&#146;s
resignation as Agent, the provisions of this Article shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.12.
Sharing of Payments. etc. Each Lender agrees that if it shall, through the
exercise of a right of banker&#146;s lien, set-off, counterclaim or otherwise,
obtain payment with respect to the Obligations which results in its receiving
more than its Pro Rata Share of the aggregate payments with respect to all of
the Obligations, then (a) such Lender shall be deemed to have simultaneously
purchased from the other Lenders a share in the Obligations so that the amount
of the Obligations held by each of Lenders shall continue to equal their
respective Pro Rata Shares, and (b) such other adjustments shall be made from
time to time as shall be equitable to insure that Lenders share such payments
ratably. No Lender shall exercise its banker&#146;s lien, set-off or other right
to accomplish such payment absent Agent&#146;s prior consent. </FONT></P>


<PAGE>


<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.13.
Payments Between Agent and Lenders. All payments by Agent to any Lender, and all
payments by any Lender to Agent, under the terms of this Agreement shall be made
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the receiving party&#146;s
address specified for notices in this Agreement. If any of Lenders fail to pay
when due any sum payable to Agent, then, except as otherwise provided in Section
8.8 hereof, such sum shall bear interest until paid at the interest rate per
annum for overnight borrowing by the payee from the Federal Reserve Bank for the
period commencing on the date such payment was due and ending on, but excluding,
the date such payment is made. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.14.
Bankruptcy Provisions. Should the Borrower become a party to a case under the
Bankruptcy Code, each Lender shall be entitled to file its own claim, to the
extent such a filing may be necessary. Agent shall review each claim before
being filed by a Lender to assure that the claim is filed on a basis consistent
with Agent&#146;s records and Agent&#146;s legal positions taken pursuant to
this Agreement. Should the Borrower become a party to a reorganization
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code, each Lender shall be recognized as the
holder of a separate claim for the purpose of the approval or rejection of a
Plan under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 1126, may freely vote such claim, and the provisions
of that Section shall control the other provisions of this Agreement that
otherwise require the consent of the Required Lenders or all Lenders in certain
circumstances. Agent shall continue to administer the Revolving Credit Loan on
behalf of Lenders, as they may be amended by any adopted Plan of Reorganization. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.15.
Procedures for Notices and Approvals. All notices given among Lenders and Agent
with respect to this Agreement or the other Credit Documents shall be given in
the manner provided in this Agreement. Additionally, should Agent request
Lenders&#146; approval of any matter, each Lender shall respond in writing
within five (5) Business Days after the Business Day on which the request was
received. If a Lender fails to so respond, it shall be deemed to have approved
the action proposed by Agent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.16.
Amendments to Article VIII. No provision of this Article VIII may be amended or
waived absent the prior written consent of all Lenders and Agent.
Borrower&#146;s approval shall not be required for the amendment or waiver of
any provision of this Article VIII; provided, however, Borrower&#146;s written
consent shall be required for any amendment of this Article VIII that would
eliminate the position of Agent. </FONT></P>

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Lenders and their
respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Borrower shall not have
the right to assign its rights or obligations under the Credit Documents, and
(ii) any assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance with Section 9.2.
Notwithstanding clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, any Lender
may at any time, without the consent of the Borrower or the Agent, assign all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided, however, that no such assignment shall release the transferor
Lender from its obligations hereunder. The Agent may treat the payee of any Note
as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until such payee
complies with Section 9.2, in the case of an assignment thereof, or, in the case
of any other transfer, a written notice of the transfer is filed with the Agent.
Any assignee or transferee of a Note agrees by acceptance thereof to be bound by
all the terms and provisions of the Credit Documents. Any request, authority or
consent of any Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such
authority or consent is the holder of any Note, shall be conclusive and binding
on any subsequent holder, transferee or assignee of such Note or of any Note or
