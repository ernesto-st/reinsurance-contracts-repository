Any loss in excess of policy limits that is made in connection &nbsp;&nbsp;with this Contract shall not exceed 25.0% of the actual catastrophe loss. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. &quot;Extra contractual obligations&quot; shall mean 90.0% of any punitive, exemplary, &nbsp;&nbsp;compensatory or consequential damages paid or payable by the Company, not &nbsp;&nbsp;covered by any other provision of this Contract and which arise from the handling of &nbsp;&nbsp;any claim on business subject to this Contract, such liabilities arising because of, but &nbsp;&nbsp;not limited to, failure by the Company to settle within the policy limits or by reason of &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company's alleged or actual negligence, fraud or bad faith in rejecting an offer of &nbsp;&nbsp;settlement or in the preparation of the defense or in the trial of an action against its &nbsp;&nbsp;insured or reinsured or in the preparation or prosecution of an appeal consequent &nbsp;&nbsp;upon such an action.  An extra contractual obligation shall be deemed, in all &nbsp;&nbsp;circumstances, to have occurred on the same date as the loss covered or alleged to &nbsp;&nbsp;be covered under the policy.  Any extra contractual obligations that are made in &nbsp;&nbsp;connection with this Contract shall not exceed 25.0% of the actual catastrophe loss. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything stated herein, this Contract shall not apply to any loss in excess &nbsp;&nbsp;of policy limits or any extra contractual obligation incurred by the Company as a result of &nbsp;&nbsp;any fraudulent and/or criminal act by any officer or director of the Company acting &nbsp;&nbsp;individually or collectively or in collusion with any individual or corporation or any other &nbsp;&nbsp;organization or party involved in the presentation, defense or settlement of any claim &nbsp;&nbsp;covered hereunder. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. &quot;Policies&quot; as used in this Contract shall mean all policies, contracts and binders of &nbsp;&nbsp;insurance or reinsurance. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;D. &quot;Ultimate net loss&quot; as used in this Contract shall mean the sum or sums (including loss in &nbsp;&nbsp;excess of policy limits, extra contractual obligations and loss adjustment expense, as &nbsp;&nbsp;defined herein) paid or payable by the Company in settlement of claims and in satisfaction &nbsp;&nbsp;of judgments rendered on account of such claims, after deduction of all salvage, all &nbsp;&nbsp;recoveries and all claims on inuring insurance or reinsurance, whether collectible or not.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that losses under this Contract are not &nbsp;&nbsp;recoverable until the Company's ultimate net loss has been ascertained. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 9 - Loss Occurrence &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The term &quot;loss occurrence&quot; shall mean the sum of all individual losses directly occasioned &nbsp;&nbsp;by any one disaster, accident or loss or series of disasters, accidents or losses arising out &nbsp;&nbsp;of one event which occurs within the area of one state of the United States or province of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

Furthermore: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. For all loss occurrences other than those referred to in subparagraphs A.1., A.2., and &nbsp;&nbsp;A.3. above, only one such period of 168 consecutive hours shall apply with respect to &nbsp;&nbsp;one event. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. As regards those loss occurrences referred to in subparagraphs A.1. and A.2., only &nbsp;&nbsp;one such period of consecutive hours (as set forth therein) shall apply with respect to &nbsp;&nbsp;one event, regardless of the duration of the event.   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. As regards those loss occurrences referred to in subparagraph A.3. above, if the &nbsp;&nbsp;disaster, accident, or loss or series of disasters, accidents, or losses occasioned by &nbsp;&nbsp;the event is of greater duration than 96 consecutive hours, then the Company may &nbsp;&nbsp;divide that disaster, accident, or loss or series of disasters, accidents, or losses into &nbsp;&nbsp;two or more loss occurrences, provided that no two periods overlap and no individual &nbsp;&nbsp;loss is included in more than one such period. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. It is understood that losses arising from a combination of two or more perils as a result of &nbsp;&nbsp;the same event may be considered as having arisen from one loss occurrence.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the hourly limitations as stated above shall not be exceeded &nbsp;&nbsp;as respects the applicable perils, and no single loss occurrence shall encompass a time &nbsp;&nbsp;period greater than 168 consecutive hours, except as regards those loss occurrences &nbsp;&nbsp;referred to in subparagraphs A.1., A.4. and A.6. above. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 10 - Loss Notices and Settlements &nbsp;&nbsp;A. Whenever losses sustained by the Company are reserved by the Company for an amount &nbsp;&nbsp;greater than 50.0% of the Company's respective retention under any excess layer &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder and/or appear likely to result in a claim under such excess layer, the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;shall notify the Subscribing Reinsurers under that excess layer and shall provide updates &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

The Reinsurer shall have the right to participate in &nbsp;&nbsp;the adjustment of such losses at its own expense. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. All loss settlements made by the Company, provided they are within the terms of this &nbsp;&nbsp;Contract and the terms of the original policy (with the exception of loss in excess of policy &nbsp;&nbsp;limits or extra contractual obligations coverage, if any, under this Contract), shall be binding &nbsp;&nbsp;upon the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer agrees to pay all amounts for which it may be liable &nbsp;&nbsp;upon receipt of reasonable evidence of the amount paid by the Company. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 11 - Cash Call &nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the provisions of the Loss Notices and Settlements Article, upon the request of &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company, the Reinsurer shall pay any amount with regard to a loss settlement or &nbsp;&nbsp;settlements that are scheduled to be made (including any payments projected to be made) &nbsp;&nbsp;within the next 20 days by the Company, subject to receipt by the Reinsurer of a satisfactory &nbsp;&nbsp;proof of loss.  Such agreed payment shall be made within 10 days from the date the demand for &nbsp;&nbsp;payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 12 - Salvage and Subrogation &nbsp;&nbsp;The Reinsurer shall be credited with salvage (i.e., reimbursement obtained or recovery made by &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company, less the actual cost, excluding salaries of officials and employees of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company and sums paid to attorneys as retainer, of obtaining such reimbursement or making &nbsp;&nbsp;such recovery) on account of claims and settlements involving reinsurance hereunder.  Salvage &nbsp;&nbsp;thereon shall always be used to reimburse the excess carriers in the reverse order of their &nbsp;&nbsp;priority according to their participation before being used in any way to reimburse the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;for its primary loss.  The Company hereby agrees to enforce its rights to salvage or subrogation &nbsp;&nbsp;relating to any loss, a part of which loss was sustained by the Reinsurer, and to prosecute all &nbsp;&nbsp;claims arising out of such rights, if, in the Company's opinion, it is economically reasonable to &nbsp;&nbsp;do so. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 13 - Reinsurance Premium &nbsp;&nbsp;As premium for reinsurance coverage provided by this Contract, the Company shall pay an &nbsp;&nbsp;amount, shown as &quot;Reinsurance Premium&quot; for that excess layer in Schedule A attached hereto &nbsp;&nbsp;payable at the inception of this Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 14 - Sanctions &nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the Company nor any Subscribing Reinsurer shall be liable for premium or loss under &nbsp;&nbsp;this Contract if it would result in a violation of any mandatory sanction, prohibition or restriction &nbsp;&nbsp;under United Nations resolutions or the trade or economic sanctions, laws or regulations of the &nbsp;&nbsp;European Union, United Kingdom or United States of America that are applicable to either party. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1120 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 10 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 15 - Late Payments &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The provisions of this Article shall not be implemented unless specifically invoked, in &nbsp;&nbsp;writing, by one of the parties to this Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. In the event any premium, loss or other payment due either party is not received by the &nbsp;&nbsp;intermediary named in the Intermediary Article (hereinafter referred to as the &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Intermediary&quot;) by the payment due date, the party to whom payment is due may, by &nbsp;&nbsp;notifying the Intermediary in writing, require the debtor party to pay, and the debtor party &nbsp;&nbsp;agrees to pay, an interest charge on the amount past due calculated for each such payment &nbsp;&nbsp;on the last business day of each month as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The number of full days which have expired since the due date or the last monthly &nbsp;&nbsp;calculation, whichever the lesser; times &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. 1/365ths of the six-month United States Treasury Bill rate as quoted in The Wall Street &nbsp;&nbsp;Journal on the first business day of the month for which the calculation is made; times &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The amount past due, including accrued interest. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It is agreed that interest shall accumulate until payment of the original amount due plus &nbsp;&nbsp;interest charges have been received by the Intermediary. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. The establishment of the due date shall, for purposes of this Article, be determined as &nbsp;&nbsp;follows: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. As respects the payment of routine deposits and premiums due the Reinsurer, the due &nbsp;&nbsp;date shall be as provided for in the applicable section of this Contract.  In the event a &nbsp;&nbsp;due date is not specifically stated for a given payment, it shall be deemed due 30 days &nbsp;&nbsp;after the date of transmittal by the Intermediary of the initial billing for each such &nbsp;&nbsp;payment. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Any claim or loss payment due the Company hereunder shall be deemed due 10 days &nbsp;&nbsp;after the proof of loss or demand for payment is transmitted to the Reinsurer.  If such &nbsp;&nbsp;loss or claim payment is not received within the 10 days, interest will accrue on the &nbsp;&nbsp;payment or amount overdue in accordance with paragraph B above, from the date the &nbsp;&nbsp;proof of loss or demand for payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. As respects a &quot;cash call&quot; made in accordance with the Cash Call Article, payment &nbsp;&nbsp;shall be deemed due 10 days after the demand for payment is transmitted to the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer.  If such loss or claim payment is not received within the 10 days, interest &nbsp;&nbsp;shall accrue on the payment or amount overdue in accordance with paragraph B &nbsp;&nbsp;above, from the date the demand for payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4.

Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting or prohibiting a Subscribing Reinsurer from &nbsp;&nbsp;contesting the validity of any claim, or from participating in the defense of any claim or suit, &nbsp;&nbsp;or prohibiting either party from contesting the validity of any payment or from initiating any &nbsp;&nbsp;arbitration or other proceeding in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.  If the &nbsp;&nbsp;debtor party prevails in an arbitration or other proceeding, then any interest charges due &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder on the amount in dispute shall be null and void.  If the debtor party loses in such &nbsp;&nbsp;proceeding, then the interest charge on the amount determined to be due hereunder shall &nbsp;&nbsp;be calculated in accordance with the provisions set forth above unless otherwise &nbsp;&nbsp;determined by such proceedings.  If a debtor party advances payment of any amount it is &nbsp;&nbsp;contesting, and proves to be correct in its contestation, either in whole or in part, the other &nbsp;&nbsp;party shall reimburse the debtor party for any such excess payment made plus interest on &nbsp;&nbsp;the excess amount calculated in accordance with this Article. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E. Interest charges arising out of the application of this Article that are $1,000 or less from any &nbsp;&nbsp;party shall be waived unless there is a pattern of late payments consisting of three or more &nbsp;&nbsp;items over the course of any 12-month period. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 16 - Offset &nbsp;&nbsp;The Company and the Reinsurer may offset any balance or amount due from one party to the &nbsp;&nbsp;other under this Contract or any other contract heretofore or hereafter entered into between the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company and the Reinsurer, whether acting as assuming reinsurer or ceding company.  The &nbsp;&nbsp;provisions of this Article shall not be affected by the insolvency of either party. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 17 - Severability of Interests and Obligations &nbsp;&nbsp;The rights, duties and obligations set forth below shall apply as if this Contract were a separate &nbsp;&nbsp;contract between the Subscribing Reinsurers and each named reinsured company: &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;A. Balances payable by any Subscribing Reinsurer to or from any reinsured party under the &nbsp;&nbsp;Contract shall not serve to offset any balances recoverable to, or from, any other reinsured &nbsp;&nbsp;party to the Contract and balances payable shall be separated by named reinsured &nbsp;&nbsp;company and paid directly to the appropriate named reinsured company's bank account. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Balances recoverable by any Subscribing Reinsurer to or from any reinsured party under &nbsp;&nbsp;the Contract shall not serve to offset any balances payable to, or from, any other reinsured &nbsp;&nbsp;party to the Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. Reports and remittances made to the Reinsurer in accordance with the applicable articles &nbsp;&nbsp;of the Contract are to be in sufficient detail to identify both the Reinsurer's loss obligations &nbsp;&nbsp;due to each named reinsured company and each named reinsured company's premium &nbsp;&nbsp;remittance under the report.  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;D. In the event of the insolvency of any of the parties to the Contract, offset shall be only &nbsp;&nbsp;allowed in accordance with the laws of the insolvent party's state of domicile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1120 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 12 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E.

However, a &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscribing Reinsurer or its designated representatives shall not have any right of access to the &nbsp;&nbsp;records of the Company if it is not current in all undisputed payments due the Company.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Undisputed&quot; as used herein shall mean any amount that the Subscribing Reinsurer has not &nbsp;&nbsp;contested in writing to the Company specifying the reason(s) why the payments are disputed.   &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 19 - Liability of the Reinsurer &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The liability of the Reinsurer shall follow that of the Company in every case and be subject &nbsp;&nbsp;in all respects to all the general and specific stipulations, clauses, waivers and modifications &nbsp;&nbsp;of the Company's policies and any endorsements thereon.  However, in no event shall this &nbsp;&nbsp;be construed in any way to provide coverage outside the terms and conditions set forth in &nbsp;&nbsp;this Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Nothing herein shall in any manner create any obligations or establish any rights against &nbsp;&nbsp;the Reinsurer in favor of any third party or any persons not parties to this Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 20 - Net Retained Lines (BRMA 32E) &nbsp;&nbsp;A.

The amount of the Reinsurer's liability hereunder in respect of any loss or losses shall not &nbsp;&nbsp;be increased by reason of the inability of the Company to collect from any other &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsurer(s), whether specific or general, any amounts which may have become due from &nbsp;&nbsp;such reinsurer(s), whether such inability arises from the insolvency of such other &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsurer(s) or otherwise. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 21 - Errors and Omissions (BRMA 14F) &nbsp;&nbsp;Inadvertent delays, errors or omissions made in connection with this Contract or any transaction &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder shall not relieve either party from any liability which would have attached had such &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

Whenever the word &quot;Dollars&quot; or the &quot;$&quot; sign appears in this Contract, they shall be &nbsp;&nbsp;construed to mean United States Dollars and all transactions under this Contract shall be in &nbsp;&nbsp;United States Dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Amounts paid or received by the Company in any other currency shall be converted to &nbsp;&nbsp;United States Dollars at the rate of exchange at the date such transaction is entered on the &nbsp;&nbsp;books of the Company. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 23 - Taxes (BRMA 50B) &nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the terms under which this Contract is issued, the Company will not claim a &nbsp;&nbsp;deduction in respect of the premium hereon when making tax returns, other than income or &nbsp;&nbsp;profits tax returns, to any state or territory of the United States of America or the District of &nbsp;&nbsp;Columbia. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 24 - Federal Excise Tax (BRMA 17D) &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The Reinsurer has agreed to allow for the purpose of paying the Federal Excise Tax the &nbsp;&nbsp;applicable percentage of the premium payable hereon (as imposed under Section 4371 of &nbsp;&nbsp;the Internal Revenue Code) to the extent such premium is subject to the Federal Excise &nbsp;&nbsp;Tax. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. In the event of any return of premium becoming due hereunder the Reinsurer will deduct &nbsp;&nbsp;the applicable percentage from the return premium payable hereon and the Company or its &nbsp;&nbsp;agent should take steps to recover the tax from the United States Government. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 25 - Reserves &nbsp;&nbsp;A. The Reinsurer agrees to fund its share of amounts, including but not limited to, the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company's ceded unearned premium and outstanding loss and loss adjustment expense &nbsp;&nbsp;reserves (including all case reserves plus any reasonable amount estimated to be &nbsp;&nbsp;unreported from known loss occurrences) (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Reinsurer's &nbsp;&nbsp;Obligations&quot;) by: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.

Has an A.M. Best Company's rating equal to or below B++ at the inception of this &nbsp;&nbsp;Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The Reinsurer, at its sole option, may fund in other than cash if its method and form of &nbsp;&nbsp;funding are acceptable to the insurance regulatory authorities involved. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. With regard to funding in whole or in part by letters of credit, it is agreed that each letter of &nbsp;&nbsp;credit will be in a form acceptable to insurance regulatory authorities involved, will be issued &nbsp;&nbsp;for a term of at least one year and will include an &quot;evergreen clause,&quot; which automatically &nbsp;&nbsp;extends the term for at least one additional year at each expiration date unless written &nbsp;&nbsp;notice of non-renewal is given to the Company not less than 30 days prior to said expiration &nbsp;&nbsp;date.  The Company and the Reinsurer further agree, notwithstanding anything to the &nbsp;&nbsp;contrary in this Contract, that said letters of credit may be drawn upon by the Company or &nbsp;&nbsp;its successors in interest at any time, without diminution because of the insolvency of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company or the Reinsurer, but only for one or more of the following purposes: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1.

<DIV style="font-size:xx-small;color:white;width:1500px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1120 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 15 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 26 - Insolvency &nbsp;&nbsp;A. In the event of the insolvency of the Company, this reinsurance shall be payable directly to &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company or to its liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor on the basis of &nbsp;&nbsp;the liability of the Company without diminution because of the insolvency of the Company or &nbsp;&nbsp;because the liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor of the Company has &nbsp;&nbsp;failed to pay all or a portion of any claim.  It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver, &nbsp;&nbsp;conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a &nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in &nbsp;&nbsp;the receivership, and that during the pendency of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate &nbsp;&nbsp;such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be &nbsp;&nbsp;adjudicated, any defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Company or its &nbsp;&nbsp;liquidator, receiver, conservator or statutory successor.  The expense thus incurred by the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the &nbsp;&nbsp;benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by &nbsp;&nbsp;the Reinsurer. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Where two or more Subscribing Reinsurers are involved in the same claim and a majority in &nbsp;&nbsp;interest elect to interpose defense to such claim, the expense shall be apportioned in &nbsp;&nbsp;accordance with the terms of this Contract as though such expense had been incurred by &nbsp;&nbsp;the Company. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. It is further understood and agreed that, in the event of the insolvency of the Company, the &nbsp;&nbsp;reinsurance under this Contract shall be payable directly by the Reinsurer to the Company &nbsp;&nbsp;or to its liquidator, receiver or statutory successor, except as provided by Section 4118(a) of &nbsp;&nbsp;the New York Insurance Law or except (1) where this Contract specifically provides another &nbsp;&nbsp;payee of such reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of the Company or (2) where the &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured or insureds has assumed such policy &nbsp;&nbsp;obligations of the Company as direct obligations of the Reinsurer to the payees under such &nbsp;&nbsp;policies and in substitution for the obligations of the Company to such payees. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 27 - Arbitration &nbsp;&nbsp;A. As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or &nbsp;&nbsp;difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually &nbsp;&nbsp;agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One &nbsp;&nbsp;Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall &nbsp;&nbsp;be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active &nbsp;&nbsp;or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's &nbsp;&nbsp;London Underwriters.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an Arbiter within &nbsp;&nbsp;30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may &nbsp;&nbsp;choose two Arbiters who shall in turn choose an Umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If &nbsp;&nbsp;the two Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an Umpire within 30 days following their &nbsp;&nbsp;appointment, each Arbiter shall nominate three candidates within 10 days thereafter, two of &nbsp;&nbsp;whom the other shall decline, and the decision shall be made by drawing lots. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;21\F7V1120 &nbsp;&nbsp;Page 16 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters within 30 days following the date of &nbsp;&nbsp;appointment of the Umpire.  The Arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable &nbsp;&nbsp;engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial &nbsp;&nbsp;formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the &nbsp;&nbsp;Arbiters shall be final and binding on both parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the &nbsp;&nbsp;Umpire and the decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon both parties.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters may be entered in any court of competent &nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdiction. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;C. If more than one Subscribing Reinsurer is involved in the same dispute, all such &nbsp;&nbsp;Subscribing Reinsurers shall, at the option of the Company, constitute and act as one party &nbsp;&nbsp;for purposes of this Article and communications shall be made by the Company to each of &nbsp;&nbsp;the Subscribing Reinsurers constituting one party, provided, however, that nothing herein &nbsp;&nbsp;shall impair the rights of such Subscribing Reinsurers to assert several, rather than joint, &nbsp;&nbsp;defenses or claims, nor be construed as changing the liability of the Subscribing Reinsurers &nbsp;&nbsp;participating under the terms of this Contract from several to joint. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;D. Each party shall bear the expense of its own Arbiter, and shall jointly and equally bear with &nbsp;&nbsp;the other the expense of the Umpire and of the arbitration.  In the event that the two &nbsp;&nbsp;Arbiters are chosen by one party, as above provided, the expense of the Arbiters, the &nbsp;&nbsp;Umpire and the arbitration shall be equally divided between the two parties. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;E. Any arbitration proceedings shall take place at a location mutually agreed upon by the &nbsp;&nbsp;parties to this Contract, but notwithstanding the location of the arbitration, all proceedings &nbsp;&nbsp;pursuant hereto shall be governed by the law of the state in which the Company has its &nbsp;&nbsp;principal office. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Article 28 - Service of Suit (BRMA 49C) &nbsp;&nbsp;(Applicable if the Reinsurer is not domiciled in the United States of America, and/or is not &nbsp;&nbsp;authorized in any State, Territory or District of the United States where authorization is required &nbsp;&nbsp;by insurance regulatory authorities) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A. It is agreed that in the event the Reinsurer fails to pay any amount claimed to be due &nbsp;&nbsp;hereunder, the Reinsurer, at the request of the Company, will submit to the jurisdiction of a &nbsp;&nbsp;court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.

Further, pursuant to any statute of any state, territory or district of the United States which &nbsp;&nbsp;makes provision therefor, the Reinsurer hereby designates the party named in its Interests &nbsp;&nbsp;and Liabilities Agreement, or if no party is named therein, the Superintendent, &nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioner or Director of Insurance or other officer specified for that purpose in the &nbsp;&nbsp;statute, or his successor or successors in office, as its true and lawful attorney upon whom &nbsp;&nbsp;may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on &nbsp;&nbsp;behalf of the Company or any beneficiary hereunder arising out of this Contract. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>

This Reinsurance does not cover any loss or liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as &nbsp;&nbsp;Insurer or Reinsurer, from any Pool of Insurers or Reinsurers formed for the purpose of covering Atomic or Nuclear &nbsp;&nbsp;Energy risks. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Without in any way restricting the operation of paragraph (1) of this Clause, this Reinsurance does not cover any loss &nbsp;&nbsp;or liability accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly and whether as Insurer or Reinsurer, from any insurance &nbsp;&nbsp;against Physical Damage (including business interruption or consequential loss arising out of such Physical Damage) &nbsp;&nbsp;to: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I. Nuclear reactor power plants including all auxiliary property on the site, or &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; II. Any other nuclear reactor installation, including laboratories handling radioactive materials in connection with &nbsp;&nbsp;reactor installations, and &quot;critical facilities&quot; as such, or &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; III.

Installations other than those listed in paragraph (2) III above using substantial quantities of radioactive isotopes &nbsp;&nbsp;or other products of nuclear fission. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof, this Reinsurance does not cover any &nbsp;&nbsp;loss or liability by radioactive contamination accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer or &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer, from any insurance on property which is on the same site as a nuclear reactor power plant or other nuclear &nbsp;&nbsp;installation and which normally would be insured therewith except that this paragraph (3) shall not operate &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (a) where Reassured does not have knowledge of such nuclear reactor power plant or nuclear installation, or &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (b) where said insurance contains a provision excluding coverage for damage to property caused by or resulting &nbsp;&nbsp;from radioactive contamination, however caused.  However on and after 1st January 1960 this sub-paragraph (b) &nbsp;&nbsp;shall only apply provided the said radioactive contamination exclusion provision has been approved by the &nbsp;&nbsp;Governmental Authority having jurisdiction thereof. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Without in any way restricting the operations of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) hereof, this Reinsurance does not cover any &nbsp;&nbsp;loss or liability by radioactive contamination accruing to the Reassured, directly or indirectly, and whether as Insurer or &nbsp;&nbsp;Reinsurer, when such radioactive contamination is a named hazard specifically insured against. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;5. It is understood and agreed that this Clause shall not extend to risks using radioactive isotopes in any form where the &nbsp;&nbsp;nuclear exposure is not considered by the Reassured to be the primary hazard. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;6.

This Contract excludes loss or liability arising from: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Business derived directly or indirectly from any pool, association, or syndicate which &nbsp;&nbsp;maintains its own reinsurance facilities.  This subparagraph 1 shall not apply with &nbsp;&nbsp;respect to: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a. Residual market mechanisms created by statute.  This Contract shall not extend, &nbsp;&nbsp;however, to afford coverage for liability arising from the inability of any other &nbsp;&nbsp;participant or member in the residual market mechanism to meet its obligations, &nbsp;&nbsp;nor shall this Contract extend to afford coverage for liability arising from any &nbsp;&nbsp;claim against the residual market mechanism brought by or on behalf of any &nbsp;&nbsp;insolvency fund (as defined in the Insolvency Fund Exclusion Clause &nbsp;&nbsp;incorporated in this Contract).  For the purposes of this Clause, the California &nbsp;&nbsp;Earthquake Authority shall be deemed to be a &quot;residual market mechanism.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; b. Inter-agency or inter-government joint underwriting or risk purchasing &nbsp;&nbsp;associations (however styled) created by or permitted by statute or regulation. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2.  Those perils insured by the Company that the Company knows, at the time the risk is &nbsp;&nbsp;bound, to be insured by or in excess of amounts insured or reinsured by any pool, &nbsp;&nbsp;association or syndicate formed for the purpose of insuring oil, gas, or petro-chemical &nbsp;&nbsp;plants; oil or gas drilling rigs; and/or aviation risks.  This subparagraph 2 shall not &nbsp;&nbsp;apply: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; a. If the total insured value over all interests of the risk is less than $250,000,000. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; b. To interests traditionally underwritten as Inland Marine or Stock or Contents &nbsp;&nbsp;written on a blanket basis. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; c. To Contingent Business Interruption liability, except when it is known to the &nbsp;&nbsp;Company, at the time the risk is bound, that the key location is insured by or &nbsp;&nbsp;through any pool, association or syndicate formed for the purpose of insuring oil, &nbsp;&nbsp;gas, or petro-chemical plants; oil or gas drilling rigs; and/or aviation risks; unless &nbsp;&nbsp;the total insured value over all interests of the risk is less than $250,000,000. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;B. With respect to loss or liability arising from the Company's participation or membership in &nbsp;&nbsp;any residual market mechanism created by statute, the Company may include in its ultimate &nbsp;&nbsp;net loss only amounts for which the Company is assessed as a direct consequence of a &nbsp;&nbsp;covered loss occurrence, subject to the following provisions: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Recovery is limited to perils otherwise protected hereunder. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the event the terms of the Company's participation or membership in any such &nbsp;&nbsp;residual market mechanism permit the Company to recoup any such direct &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
