integral multiple thereof or to terminate entirely the Total Revolving Credit
Commitment, whereupon the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Revolving Credit
Lenders shall be reduced pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment of the amount
specified in such notice or, as the case may be, terminated. Promptly after
receiving any notice of the Borrower delivered pursuant to this &#167;2.3, the

thereof. Upon the effective date of any such reduction or termination, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of
the Revolving Credit Lenders the full amount of any Commitment Fee then accrued
on the amount of the reduction. No reduction or termination of the Revolving
Credit Commitments may be reinstated. In addition, the Total Revolving Credit

payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not,
however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to
pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any
conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Revolving Credit
Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall

if less, the outstanding amount of all Revolving Credit Loans made by such
Revolving Credit Lender, plus interest accrued thereon, as set forth below.

made by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Revolving Credit
Lenders from the immediately preceding Settlement Date through the close
of business on the prior day and the amount of any Eurodollar Rate Loans
to be made (following the giving of notice pursuant to &#167;2.6) on such date

amount (a &#147;Settlement Amount&#148;) that each Revolving Credit Lender (a

Revolving Credit Lenders and the Borrower or to the Revolving Credit
Lenders with respect to any amounts owing under this &#167;2.9 shall be prima
facie evidence of the amount due and owing. Each Settling Lender shall,
not later than 1:00 p.m. (Dallas, Texas time) on such Settlement Date,
effect a wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Administrative Agent in the amount of the Settlement Amount for such
Settling Lender. All funds advanced by any Revolving Credit Lender as a
Settling Lender pursuant to this &#167;2.9 shall for all purposes be treated
as a Revolving Credit Loan made by such Settling Lender to the Borrower
and all funds received by any Revolving Credit Lender pursuant to this
&#167;2.9 shall for all purposes be treated as repayment of amounts owed with

In the event that any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation,
receivership or similar cases or proceedings in which the Borrower is a
debtor prevent a Settling Lender from making any Revolving Credit Loan to
effect a Settlement as contemplated hereby, such Settling Lender will

purchase of participations, distribution, pro tanto assignment of claims,

of such Settling Lender&#146;s Settlement Amount, and the Administrative Agent
may (but it shall not be required to), in reliance upon such assumption,

foregoing shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to pay
Non-Excluded Taxes in the event that, as a result of any change in any
applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
change in interpretation, administration or application thereof, a

under this Credit Agreement and any Note without deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes is no longer properly entitled
by law to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence at a subsequent

maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Lender shall forthwith give notice of such
circumstances to the Borrower and the other Lenders and thereupon (a)&nbsp;the

Period applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans or within such earlier period

Borrower agrees to pay such Lender for the amount of such reduction in the

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>8.16.1. In General. </B>Each Employee Benefit Plan and each Guaranteed
Pension Plan has been maintained and operated in compliance in all
material respects with the provisions of ERISA and all Applicable Pension
Legislation and, to the extent applicable, the Code, including but not
limited to the provisions thereunder respecting prohibited transactions
and the bonding of fiduciaries and other persons handling plan funds as
required by &#167;412 of ERISA. The Borrower has heretofore delivered to the
Administrative Agent the most recently completed annual report, Form
5500, with all required attachments, and actuarial statement required to
be submitted under &#167;103(d) of ERISA, with respect to each Guaranteed
Pension Plan.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>8.16.2. Terminability of Welfare Plans. </B>No Employee Benefit Plan,
which is an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of &#167;3(1) or
&#167;3(2)(B) of ERISA, provides benefit coverage subsequent to termination of
employment, except as required by Title I, Part&nbsp;6 of ERISA or the
applicable state insurance laws. The Borrower may terminate each such
Plan at any time (or at any time subsequent to the expiration of any
applicable bargaining agreement) in the discretion of the Borrower
without liability to any Person other than for claims arising prior to
termination.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>8.16.3. Guaranteed Pension Plans. </B>Each contribution required to be
made to a Guaranteed Pension Plan, whether required to be made to avoid
the incurrence of an accumulated funding deficiency, the notice or lien
provisions of &#167;302(f) of ERISA, or otherwise, has been timely made. No
waiver of an accumulated funding deficiency or extension of amortization
periods has been received with respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan,
and neither the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to or has
posted security in connection with an amendment to a Guaranteed Pension
Plan pursuant to &#167;307 of ERISA or &#167;401(a)(29) of the Code. No liability
to the PBGC (other than required insurance premiums, all of which have
been paid) has been incurred by the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate with
respect to any Guaranteed Pension Plan and there has not been any ERISA
Reportable Event (other than an ERISA Reportable Event as to which the
requirement of 30&nbsp;days notice has been waived), or any other event or
condition which presents a material risk of termination of any Guaranteed
Pension Plan by the PBGC. Based on the latest valuation of each
Guaranteed Pension Plan (which in each case occurred within twelve months
of the date of this representation), and on the actuarial methods and
assumptions employed for that valuation, the aggregate benefit
liabilities of all such Guaranteed Pension Plans within the meaning of
&#167;4001 of ERISA did not exceed the aggregate value of the assets of all
such Guaranteed Pension Plans, disregarding for this purpose the benefit
liabilities and assets of any Guaranteed Pension Plan with assets in
excess of benefit liabilities<B>.</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>8.16.4. Multiemployer Plans. </B>Neither the Borrower nor any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any material liability (including secondary
liability) to any Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan under &#167;4201 of ERISA or as a
result of a sale of assets described in &#167;4204 of ERISA. Neither the
Borrower nor any ERISA

The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed in
all material respects all of its obligations with respect to each such
FCC License except in respect of findings of violations, or claims
alleging violations, by the Borrower or such Subsidiary of FCC indecency

Effect and provided further that the Borrower or such Subsidiary is
taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to contest or mitigate its
potential liabilities in respect of such Indecency Claims and has set

thereto. No event has occurred which: (i)&nbsp;has resulted in, or after

Borrower with additional commitments to make Loans under this Credit Agreement
in an aggregate amount not to exceed six hundred and seventy five million
dollars ($675,000,000) subject to the limitations set forth below. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to provide the
Borrower with all or any part of such additional commitment; provided that by
execution of this Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall be deemed to have consented, without the need for further or subsequent
consent, (a)&nbsp;to such additional commitments which any other Lender or lending
institution may agree to provide for the Loans which may be advanced in respect
thereof and any resulting changes in any Commitment Percentage of any Tranche,
and (b)&nbsp;any amendments which may be made to the Loan Documents in order to
evidence and document such commitments and Loans to the extent that any such
amendment (i)&nbsp;does not amend any of the provisions specified in &#167;18.12(a) as
requiring the consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii)&nbsp;does not modify the
relative priority of the Loans (including any such new Loans) and commitments
(including any such new commitments) with respect to the payment, guarantees,
collateral or other collateral support, and (iii)&nbsp;is consistent with all other
requirements of this &#167;15. The Borrower may elect to allocate all or any
portion of such additional commitment among the existing Tranches or may
allocate all or a portion of such additional commitment to one or more new
Tranches; provided that (x)&nbsp;the Total Revolving Credit Commitment may not be
increased by more than three hundred and fifty million dollars ($350,000,000)
as a result of such allocations, (y)&nbsp;any additional Revolving Credit Loans and
Revolving Credit Commitments shall mature or terminate, as the case may be, on
or after the Revolving Credit Loan Maturity Date and (z)&nbsp;any amounts not
allocated to increase the Total Revolving Credit Commitment shall be advanced
in the form of term loans under a bank term tranche or fund term tranche and
any such additional term loans shall either (A)&nbsp;with respect to any additional
term loans structured as a bank term tranche, amortize on the same or slower
schedule as the Tranche B Term Loan as in effect at such time until the Tranche
B Maturity Date and shall have a final maturity date on or after the Tranche B
Maturity Date, and (B)&nbsp;with respect to any additional term loans structured as
a fund term tranche, amortize either on the same schedule as the Tranche B Term
Loan or have a weighted average term to maturity which is longer than the
Tranche B Term Loan. Moreover, if the interest rate in respect of any
additional Revolving Credit Loans, or the commitment fees payable in respect of
any additional Revolving Credit Commitments, made available pursuant to this
&#167;15 exceeds the interest rate or the Commitment Fee payable in respect of the
Revolving Credit Loans and the Revolving Credit Commitments as provided in &#167;2.5
and &#167;2.2, respectively, then the interest rate calculated in accordance with
&#167;2.5 or such Commitment Fee (as applicable) shall automatically be increased to
the interest rate or the commitment fee, as the case may be, payable in respect
of the additional Revolving Credit Loans and Revolving Credit Commitments made
available pursuant to this &#167;15 without the requirement of any further action or
consent on the part of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Borrower.
In addition, if the interest rate payable in respect of any additional term
loans made available pursuant to this &#167;15 at any time exceeds the interest rate
payable in respect of the Tranche B Term Loan as provided in &#167;3.5 plus 0.25%,

Refinancing Note Indenture, as applicable, without requiring the Borrower to
demonstrate compliance with any leverage ratio incurrence covenants contained
in the Subordinated Note Indenture, the Senior Discount Note Indenture and the
Refinancing Note Indenture, as applicable. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any Lender shall have any obligation to provide the Borrower with any such
additional commitments.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>15.2. Evidence of Debt. </B>The Loans made pursuant to this &#167;15 shall be
evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the applicable
Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The
accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each such Lender
shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made
pursuant to this &#167;15 by the applicable Lenders to the Borrower and the interest
and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall
not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the
event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any
applicable Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in
respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent
shall control in the absence of manifest error. In addition to such accounts
or records, upon request of any applicable Lender, the Borrower shall execute
and deliver to such Lender , in the case of any new Tranche, a new Note for
such Tranche and, in the case of an increase to an existing Tranche, an amended
Note as applicable for the corresponding Tranche in the form of the appropriate
Note then held by such Lender (the &#147;Current Note&#148;), in a principal amount equal

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related
Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Credit Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents
and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue
to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based
upon this Credit Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or
under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any
such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its
rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The
exculpatory provisions of this &#167;16 shall apply to any such sub-agent and
to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well
as activities as Administrative Agent.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>16.5.1. Payments to Administrative Agent. </B>A payment by the Parent
or the Borrower to the Administrative Agent hereunder or any of the other
Loan Documents for the account of any Lender shall constitute a payment
to such Lender. The Administrative Agent agrees promptly to distribute
to each Lender such Lender&#146;s pro rata share of payments received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or in any of the other Loan Documents.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>16.5.2. Distribution by Administrative Agent. </B>If in the opinion of
the Administrative Agent the distribution of any amount received by it in
such capacity hereunder, under the Notes or under any of the other Loan
Documents might involve it in liability, it may refrain from making such
distribution until its right to make such distribution shall have been
adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. If a court of
competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any amount received and
distributed by the Administrative Agent is to be repaid, each Person to
whom any such distribution shall have been made shall either repay to the
Administrative Agent its proportionate share of the amount so adjudged to
be repaid or shall pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons
as shall be determined by such court.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>16.5.3. Delinquent Lenders. </B>Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Credit Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, any Lender that fails (a)&nbsp;to make available to the
Administrative Agent its pro rata share of any Loan or to purchase any
Letter of Credit Participation or (b)&nbsp;to comply with the provisions of
&#167;16.1 with respect to making dispositions and arrangements with the other
Lenders, where such Lender&#146;s share of any payment received, whether by
setoff or otherwise, is in excess of its pro rata share of such payments
due and payable to all of the Lenders, in each case as, when and to the
full extent required by the provisions of this Credit Agreement, shall be
deemed delinquent (a &#147;Delinquent Lender&#148;) and shall be deemed a
Delinquent Lender until such time as such delinquency is satisfied. The
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, apply any and all payments
otherwise due to a Delinquent Lender from the Borrower, whether on
account of outstanding Loans, Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations, interest,
fees or otherwise, to the remaining nondelinquent Lenders for application
to, and reduction of, their respective pro rata shares of all outstanding
Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. The Delinquent Lender hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent to distribute and apply such payments
to the nondelinquent Lenders in proportion to their respective pro rata
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares of all outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations. A
Delinquent Lender shall be deemed to have satisfied in full a delinquency
when and if, as a result of application of the assigned payments to all
outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations of the
nondelinquent Lenders, the Lenders&#146; respective pro rata shares of all
outstanding Loans and Unpaid Reimbursement Obligations have returned to
those in effect immediately prior to such delinquency and without giving
effect to the nonpayment causing such delinquency.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>16.6. Reimbursement by Lenders. </B>To the extent that the Borrower for any
reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under &#167;18.2 or &#167;18.3 to be
paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any
Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the
case may be, such Lender&#146;s Total Percentage (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount, provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its
capacity as such, or against any Related Party acting for the Administrative
Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The
obligations of the Lenders under this &#167;16.6 are several and the failure or
refusal of any Lender to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its portion of
such unpaid amount shall not relieve any other Lender from its several
obligation hereunder. The undertaking in this &#167;16.6 shall survive termination
of the Total Commitment, the payment of all other Obligations and the
resignation of the Administrative Agent.

at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have
the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor, which
shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any
such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have
been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
