If Employee is made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than (i) an action directly by the Company against Employee, and other than (ii) such a threatened, pending or
completed suit or proceeding brought against Employee and/or the Company by a third- party and which obligates Employee to provide the
Company indemnity under Section 13 below), by reason of or in connection with the fact that Employee is or was performing services for
the Company under this Agreement, then the Company shall indemnify Employee against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys&rsquo;
fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, as actually and reasonably incurred by Employee in connection therewith to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law. In the event that both Employee and the Company are made a party to the same third-party action,
complaint, suit or proceeding, the Company agrees to engage competent legal representation, and Employee agrees to use the same representation,
provided that if counsel selected by the Company shall have a conflict of interest preventing such counsel from representing Employee,
Employee may engage separate counsel of his choosing and the Company shall pay all reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees of such separate counsel.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Employee shall not be entitled to indemnification or expense advances under this Agreement in
any case where he has exhibited gross negligence or willful misconduct, or performed criminal or fraudulent acts, or engaged in violations
of federal securities laws; and the Company may withhold expense advances if it reasonably determines that Employee is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder because of gross negligence, willful misconduct, the performance of criminal or fraudulent acts or the violation
of federal securities laws.</P>

constitute a &ldquo;parachute payment&rdquo; within the meaning of Code &sect;280G, and (ii) but for this sentence, be subject to
the excise tax imposed by Code &sect;4999 (the &ldquo;Excise Tax&rdquo;), then such Payment shall be adjusted to equal to the
Reduced Amount. The &ldquo;Reduced Amount&rdquo; shall be either (x) the largest portion of the Payment (prior to adjustment) that
would result in no portion of the Payment being subject to the Excise Tax or (y) the largest portion of the Payment (prior to
adjustment), which, after taking into account all applicable federal, state and local employment taxes, income taxes and the Excise
Tax (all computed at the highest applicable marginal rate), results in Employee&rsquo;s receipt, on an after-tax basis, of the
greater amount of the Payment (than that calculated under clause (x) above) notwithstanding that all or some portion of the Payment
may be subject to the Excise Tax. If a reduction in payments or benefits constituting &ldquo;parachute payments&rdquo; is necessary
so that the Payment equals the Reduced Amount, reduction shall occur in the following order unless Employee elects, in writing, a
different order (provided, however, that such election shall be subject to the Company&rsquo;s approval if made on or after the
effective date of the event that triggers the Payment): reduction of cash payments; cancellation of accelerated vesting of stock
options, if any; and reduction of employee benefits. In the event that acceleration of vesting of the stock options is to be
reduced, such acceleration of vesting shall be cancelled in the reverse order of the date of grant of Employee&rsquo;s stock options
(i.e., the earliest granted stock option will be cancelled last) unless Employee elects, in writing, a different order for
cancellation.</P>

hearing date to begin at 9:00 a.m. and to conclude at 5:00 p.m. The arbitrators will use all reasonable efforts to issue the final
written report containing award or awards within a period of five business days after closure of the proceedings. Failure of the
arbitrators to meet the time limits of this Section will not be a basis for challenging the award. The Arbitration Tribunal will not
have the authority to award punitive damages to either party. Each party will bear its own expenses, but the parties will share
equally the expenses of the Arbitration Tribunal. The Arbitration Tribunal shall award attorneys&rsquo; fees and other related costs
payable by the losing party to the successful party as it deems equitable. This Agreement will be enforceable, and any arbitration
