<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS) Administration is the single state agency for the<br />
 Medicaid and SCHIP programs. AHCCCS has operated under an 1115 Research and Demonstration Waiver since<br />
 1982 when it became the first statewide Medicaid managed care system in the nation. The program is a model<br />
public-private collaboration that includes the state and its counties, the federal government, and managed care<br />
 contractors and providers from both the public and private sectors. AHCCCS has remained a leader in Medicaid<br />
 Managed Care through the diligent pursuit of excellence and cost effectiveness by Managed Care Contractors<br />
 (MCOs) in collaboration with the AHCCCS Administration.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In order to continue this collaboration, Contractors must continue to add value to the program. A Contractor adds<br />
 value when it:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font> <font face="Wingdings 2">&#150;</font> Recognizes that Medicaid members are entitled to care and assistance navigating the
service delivery<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;system and demonstrates special effort to assure members receive necessary services, including<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;prevention and screening services.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Recognizes that Medicaid members with special health care needs or chronic health conditions require<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;care coordination, and provides that coordination. This is particularly true if a member must receive<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;services from other AHCCCS Contractors in addition to the Contractor.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Recognizes that Medicaid members have the right to contact their elected officials in an effort to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;secure necessary services and assist members in order to reduce their need to contact elected officials.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Contractor provides information to elected officials to help them respond to the member.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Recognizes that health care providers are an essential partner in the delivery of health care services,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and operates in a manner that is efficient and effective for health care providers as well as the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Contractor.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Avoids administrative practices that place unnecessary burdens on providers with little or no impact<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;on quality of care or cost containment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Recognizes that performance improvement is both clinical and operational in nature and self monitors<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;and self corrects as necessary to improve contract compliance or operational excellence.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Recognizes that the program is publicly funded, and as such is subject to public scrutiny and behaves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;in a manner that is supported by the general public.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="SymbolMT">&bull;</font> Recognizes that the program is subject to significant regulation and operates in compliance with those<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;regulations.<br />
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS encourages Contractor innovation and application of best practices. The AHCCCS administration is<br />
always looking for ways to reduce administrative costs and improve program efficiency. Over the term of the<br />
contract, AHCCCS will work collaboratively with contractors to evaluate ways to reduce program complexity,<br />
improve chronic disease management, reduce administrative burdens, leverage joint purchasing power, and<br />
reduce unnecessary Medicaid/SCHIP administrative and medical costs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">1.</font></b> <b>TERM OF CONTRACT AND OPTION TO RENEW</b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The initial term of this contract shall be 10/1/08 through 9/30/11, with two additional one-year options to renew.<br />
All contract renewals shall be through contract amendment. AHCCCS shall issue amendments prior to the end<br />
date of the contract when there is an adjustment to capitation rates and/or changes to the scope of services<br />
contained herein. Changes to the scope of services include, but are not limited, to changes in the enrolled<br />
population, changes in covered services and changes in GSAs.<br />
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If the Contractor has been awarded a contract in more than one GSA, each such contract will be considered<br />
separately renewable. AHCCCS may renew the Contractor&rsquo;s contract in one GSA, but not in another. In<br />
addition, if the Contractor has had significant problems of non-compliance in one GSA, it may result in the capping<br />
 of the Contractor&rsquo;s enrollment in all GSAs. Further, AHCCCS may require the Contractor to renew all<br />
currently awarded GSAs, or may terminate the contract if the Contractor does not agree to renew all currently<br />
awarded GSAs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">When AHCCCS issues an amendment to the contract, the provisions of such renewal will be deemed to have<br />
been accepted 60 days after the date of mailing by AHCCCS, even if the amendment has not been signed by the<br />
Contractor, unless within that time the Contractor notifies AHCCCS in writing that it refuses to sign the renewal<br />
amendment. If the Contractor provides such notification, AHCCCS will initiate contract termination<br />
proceedings.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Contractor&rsquo;s Notice of Intent Not To Renew:</font></i></b> If the Contractor chooses not to renew this contract, the<br />
Contractor may be liable for certain costs associated with the transition of its members to a different Contractor.<br />
If the Contractor provides AHCCCS written notice of its intent not to renew this contract at least 180 days before<br />
its expiration, this liability for transition costs may be waived by AHCCCS.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Contract Termination:</font></i></b> In the event that the contract or any portion thereof is terminated for any reason, or<br />
expires, the Contractor shall assist AHCCCS in the transition of its members to other Contractors, and shall<br />
abide by standards and protocols set forth in Paragraph 9, Transition of Members. In addition, AHCCCS<br />
reserves the right to extend the term of the contract on a month-to-month basis to assist in any transition of<br />
members. The Contractor shall make provision for continuing all management and administrative services<br />
until the transition of all members is completed and all other requirements of this contract are satisfied. The<br />
Contractor shall be responsible for providing all reports set forth in this contract and necessary for the<br />
transition process, and shall be responsible for the following:</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">a. Notification of subcontractors and members.<br />
b. Payment of all outstanding obligations for medical care rendered to members. Until AHCCCS is satisfied<br />
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that the Contractor has paid all such obligations, the Contractor shall provide the following reports to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHCCCS on a monthly basis (due the 15th day of the month, for the preceding month):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) A monthly claims aging report by provider/creditor including IBNR amounts;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) A monthly summary of cash disbursements and provider/creditor settlements;<br />

c. Quarterly and Audited Financial Statements up to the date of contract termination. The financial statement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requirement will not be absolved without an official release from AHCCCS.<br />
d. Encounter reporting until all services rendered prior to contract termination have reached adjudicated status<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and data validation of the information has been completed, as communicated by a letter of release from<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHCCCS.<br />
e. Cooperation with reinsurance audit activities on prior contract years until release has been granted by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHCCCS.<br />
f. Cooperation with any open reconciliation activities including, but not limited to, PPC, Med Prospective, or SSDI-<br />

g. Quarterly Quality Management and Medical Management reports will be submitted as required by Section<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D, Paragraphs 23, Quality Management, and 24, Medical Management, as appropriate to provide AHCCCS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with information on services rendered up to the date of Contract termination. This will include quality of care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (QOC) concern reporting based on the date of service, as opposed to the date of reporting, for a period of 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; months after contract termination.<br />
h. Performance Bond will be required until remaining AHCCCS liabilities are less than $50,000.<br />
i. In the event of termination or suspension of the contract by AHCCCS, such termination or suspension shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not affect the obligation of the Contractor to indemnify AHCCCS for any claim by any third party against the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State or AHCCCS arising from the Contractor's performance of this contract and for which the Contractor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would otherwise be liable under this contract.<br />
j. Any dispute by the Contractor, with respect to termination or suspension of this contract by AHCCCS, shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be exclusively governed by the provisions of Section E, Paragraph 26, Disputes.<br />
k. Any funds advanced to the Contractor for coverage of members for periods after the date of termination shall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be returned to AHCCCS within 30 days of termination of the contract.<br />
l. Record retention requirements, as described in Section D Paragraph 63; Section E, Paragraph 40 and<br />

Information about these Contractors will be given to each applicant during the application process for<br />
AHCCCS benefits. If there is only one Contractor available for the applicant&rsquo;s Geographic Service Area, no<br />
choice is offered as long as the Contractor offers the member a choice of PCPs. Members who do not choose a<br />
Contractor prior to AHCCCS being notified of their eligibility are automatically assigned to a Contractor based<br />
on family continuity or the auto-assignment algorithm. Once assigned, AHCCCS sends a Freedom of Choice<br />
notice to the member and gives them 30 days to choose a different Contractor from the auto-assigned<br />
Contractor. See Section D, Paragraph 6, Auto-Assignment Algorithm, for further explanation.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor will share with AHCCCS the cost of providing information about the Acute Care Contractors<br />
to potential members and to those eligible for annual enrollment choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Exceptions to the above enrollment policies for Title XIX members include previously enrolled members who<br />
have been disenrolled for less than 90 days. These members will be automatically enrolled with the same<br />
Contractor, if still available. Women who become eligible for the Family Planning Services Extension<br />
Program, will remain assigned to their current Contractor.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The effective date of enrollment for a new Title XIX member with the Contractor is the day AHCCCS takes<br />
the enrollment action. The Contractor is responsible for payment of medically necessary covered services<br />
retroactive to the member&rsquo;s beginning date of eligibility, as reflected in PMMIS.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">SSDI-Temporary Medical Coverage and KidsCare Title XXI members must select a Contractor prior to being<br />
determined eligible, and therefore will not be auto-assigned. HIFA parents who do not choose a Contractor<br />
will be enrolled with their child&rsquo;s Contractor following the enrollment rules set forth in R9-31-1719.<br />
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">When a member is transferred from Title XIX to Title XXI and has not made a Contractor choice for Title<br />
XXI, the member will remain with his/her current Contractor and a Freedom of Choice notice will be sent to<br />
the member. The member may then change plans no later than 30 days from the date the Freedom of Choice<br />
notice is sent.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The effective date of enrollment for a Title XXI member (including HIFA parents) and SSDI-Temporary<br />
Medical Coverage members will be the first day of the month following notification to the Contractor. In the<br />
event that eligibility is determined on or after the 25</font>th day of the month, eligibility will begin on the 1st day of<br />
the second month following the determination.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Prior Period Coverage:</font></i></b> AHCCCS provides prior period coverage for the period of time prior to the Title XIX<br />
member&rsquo;s enrollment during which the member is eligible for covered services. The time frame is from the<br />
effective date of eligibility to the day the member is enrolled with the Contractor. The Contractor receives<br />
notification from the Administration of the member&rsquo;s enrollment. The Contractor is responsible for payment of<br />
all claims for medically necessary covered services, including all behavioral health services, provided to<br />
members during prior period coverage. This may include services provided prior to the contract year (See<br />
Section D, Paragraph 53, Compensation, for a description of the Contractor&rsquo;s reimbursement from AHCCCS<br />
for this eligibility time period).</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">For behavioral health services, the 72-hour maximum liability period specified in A.A.C. R9-22-210.01 does<br />
NOT apply to services provided during prior period coverage. Additionally, behavioral health services<br />
provided during the PPC period are not considered in the calculation of the maximum of 72 hours of inpatient<br />
emergency behavioral health services as described in the rule. Pursuant to A.R.S. 36-545 et seq., court-ordered<br />
behavioral health screening and evaluation services are the responsibility of the county. Refer also to Section<br />
D, Paragraph 12, Behavioral Health Services.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Newborns</font></i></b><i>:</i> Newborns born to AHCCCS eligible mothers enrolled at the time of the child's birth will be<br />
enrolled with the mother's Contractor, when newborn notification is received by AHCCCS. The Contractor is<br />
responsible for notifying AHCCCS of a child&rsquo;s birth to an enrolled member. Capitation for the newborn will<br />
begin on the date notification is received by AHCCCS. The effective date of AHCCCS eligibility will be the<br />
newborn&rsquo;s date of birth, and the Contractor is responsible for all covered services to the newborn, whether or<br />
not AHCCCS has received notification of the child&rsquo;s birth. AHCCCS is currently available to receive<br />
notification 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via phone or the AHCCCS website. Each eligible mother of a<br />
newborn is sent a letter advising her of her right to choose a different Contractor for her child; the date of the<br />
change will be the date of processing the request from the mother. If the mother does not request a change, the<br />
child will remain with the mother's Contractor.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Newborns of FES mothers are auto-assigned to a Contractor and mothers of these newborns sent letters<br />
advising them of their right to choose a different Contractor for their children. In the event the FES mother<br />
chooses a different Contractor, AHCCCS will recoup all capitation paid to the originally assigned Contractor<br />
and the baby will be enrolled retroactive to the date of birth with the second Contractor. The second<br />
Contractor will receive prior period capitation from the date of birth to the day before assignment and<br />
prospective capitation from the date of assignment forward. The second Contractor will be responsible for all<br />
covered services to the newborn from date of birth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Enrollment Guarantees:</font></i></b> Upon initial capitated enrollment as a Title XIX-eligible member, the member is<br />
guaranteed a minimum of five full months of continuous enrollment. Upon initial capitated enrollment as a<br />
Title XXI-eligible member, the member is guaranteed a minimum of 12 full months of continuous enrollment.<br />
Enrollment guarantees do not apply to HIFA parents and SSDI-Temporary Medical Coverage members. The<br />
enrollment guarantee is a one-time benefit. If a member changes from one Contractor to another within the<br />
enrollment guarantee period, the remainder of the guarantee period applies to the new Contractor. The<br />
enrollment guarantee may not be granted or may be terminated if the member is incarcerated, or if a minor<br />
child is adopted. AHCCCS Rules R9-22, Article 17, and R9-31, Article 3, describes other reasons for which<br />
the enrollment guarantee may not apply.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Native Americans</font></i></b><i>:</i> Native Americans, on- or off-reservation, may choose to receive services from Indian<br />
Health Service (IHS), a P.L. 93-638 tribal facility or any available Contractor. If a choice is not made within<br />
the specified time limit, Native American Title XIX members living on-reservation will be assigned to the<br />
AHCCCS American Indian Health Program (AIHP) as FFS members. The designation of a zip code as a<br />
&lsquo;reservation zip code&rsquo;, not the physical location of the residence, is the factor that determines whether a<br />
member is considered on or off-reservation for these purposes. Further, if the member resides in a zip code that<br />
contains land on both sides of a reservation boundary and the zip code is assigned as off-reservation, the<br />
physical location of the residence does not change the off-reservation designation for the member. Native<br />
American Title XIX members living off-reservation who do not make a Contractor choice will be assigned to<br />
an available Contractor using the AHCCCS protocol for family continuity and the auto-assignment algorithm.<br />
Native American Title XXI members must make a choice prior to being determined eligible. Title XXI HIFA<br />
parent members&rsquo; enrollment will follow the Title XIX enrollment rules. Native Americans may change from<br />
AHCCCS AIHP FFS to a Contractor or from a Contractor to AHCCCS AIHP FFS at any time.</p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">4.</font></b> <b>ANNUAL ENROLLMENT CHOICE</b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS conducts an Annual Enrollment Choice (AEC) for members on their annual anniversary date [42<br />
CFR 438.56(c)(2)(ii)]. AHCCCS may hold an open enrollment in any GSA or combination of GSAs, as<br />
deemed necessary. During AEC, members may change Contractors subject to the availability of other<br />
Contractors within their Geographic Service Area. A members is mailed a printed enrollment form and other<br />
information required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) 60 days prior to his/her AEC date and may<br />
choose a new Contractor by contacting AHCCCS to complete the enrollment process. If the member does not<br />
participate in the AEC, no change of Contractor will be made (except for approved changes under the ACOM<br />
<i>Change of Plan Policy</i>) during the new anniversary year. This holds true if a Contractor&rsquo;s contract is renewed<br />
and the member continues to live in a Contractor&rsquo;s service area. The Contractor shall comply with the ACOM<br />
<i>Member Transition for Annual Enrollment Choice Policy, Open Enrollment and Other Plan Changes Policy,<br />
</i>and the <i>AMPM</i>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">5.</font></b> <b>ENROLLMENT AFTER CONTRACT AWARD</b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In the event that AHCCCS does not award a CYE &rsquo;09 contract to an incumbent contractor, AHCCCS will<br />
direct enrollment effective October 1, 2008, for those members enrolled with an exiting Contractor. Members<br />
will be auto assigned to all or select Contractors utilizing the auto assignment algorithm found in the<br />
<i>Conversion Group Assignment</i> section of Attachment G, Auto-Assignment Algorithm. The members in the<br />
Conversion Group will have the opportunity to choose an alternate Contractor, according to the details in<br />
Attachment G, Auto-Assignment Algorithm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS will also use an enhanced auto-assignment algorithm in certain GSAs for new Contractors or those<br />
incumbent Contractors defined as small Contractors. This enhanced algorithm may be in effect beginning<br />
October 1, 2008, for a period of no less than three months and no more than six months. Those Contractors not<br />
defined as new or small Contractors in a GSA may not receive auto-assigned members during the enhanced<br />
algorithm period. See Attachment G, Auto-Assignment Algorithm, for details.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In addition to auto-assignment, AHCCCS will make changes to both annual enrollment choice materials and<br />
new enrollee materials prior to October 1, 2008, to reflect the change in available contractors. The auto<br />
assignment algorithm will be adjusted to exclude auto assignment of new enrollees to exiting Contractor(s)<br />
effective August 1, 2008.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">6.</font></b> <b>AUTO-ASSIGNMENT ALGORITHM</b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Members who do not exercise their right to choose and do not have family continuity are assigned to a Contractor<br />
through an auto-assignment algorithm. Once auto-assigned, AHCCCS sends a Freedom of Choice notice to the<br />
member and gives him/her 30 days to choose a different Contractor from the auto-assigned Contractor. The<br />
algorithm is a mathematical formula used to distribute members to the various Contractors in a manner that is<br />
predictable and consistent with AHCCCS goals. The algorithm favors those Contractors with lower capitation<br />
rates and higher Program scores in this procurement and as described below. For further details on the AHCCCS<br />
Auto-Assignment Algorithm, refer to Attachment G. AHCCCS may change the algorithm at any time during the<br />
term of the contract in response to Contractor-specific issues (e.g. imposition of an enrollment cap).<br />
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In future contract years, AHCCCS may adjust the auto-assignment algorithm in consideration of Contractors&rsquo;<br />
clinical performance measure results when calculating target percentages. Ranking in the algorithm may be<br />
weighted, based on the number of Performance Measures for which a Contractor is meeting the current AHCCCS<br />
Minimum Performance Standard (MPS) as a percentage of the total number of measures utilized in the<br />
calculation. AHCCCS will determine and communicate the Performance Measures to be used to evaluate<br />
Contractor performance prior to the beginning of the contract year to be measured.</font></p>

are provided covered services without regard to payer source, race, color, creed, gender, religion, age, national<br />
origin (to include those with limited English proficiency), ancestry, marital status, sexual preference, genetic<br />
information, or physical or mental handicap, except where medically indicated. The Contractor must take into<br />
account a member&rsquo;s literacy and culture when addressing members and their concerns, and must take<br />
reasonable steps to encourage subcontractors to do the same. The Contractor must make interpreters, including<br />
assistance for the vision- or hearing- impaired, available free of charge for all members to ensure appropriate<br />
delivery of covered services. The Contractor must provide members with information instructing them how to<br />
access these services.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If the Contractor knowingly executes a subcontract with a provider with the intent of allowing or permitting<br />
the subcontractor to implement barriers to care (i.e., the terms of the subcontract act to discourage the full<br />
utilization of services by some members); the Contractor will be in default of its contract.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor shall respond to requests for services potentially covered by CRSA in accordance with the<br />
related ACOM policy. The Contractor is responsible for addressing prior authorization requests if CRSA fails<br />
to comply with the timeframes specified in the related ACOM policy. The Contractor remains ultimately<br />
responsible for the provision of all covered services to its members, including emergency services not related<br />
to a CRS condition, emergency services related to a CRS condition rendered outside the CRS network, and<br />
AHCCCS-covered services denied by CRSA for the reason that it is not a service related to a CRS condition.<br />
</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Referral to CRSA does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for providing timely medically<br />
necessary AHCCCS services not covered by CRSA. In the event that CRSA denies a medically necessary<br />
AHCCCS service for the reason that it is not related to a CRS condition, the Contractor must promptly respond<br />
to the service authorization request and authorize the provision of medically necessary services. CRSA cannot<br />
contest the Contractor prior authorization determination if CRSA fails to timely respond to a service<br />
authorization request. The Contractor, through its Medical Director, may request review from the CRS<br />
Regional Medical Director when it denies a service for the reason that it is not covered by the CRS Program.<br />
The Contractor may also request a hearing with the Administration if it is dissatisfied with the CRSA<br />
determination. If the AHCCCS Hearing Decision determines that the service should have been provided by<br />
CRSA, CRSA shall be financially responsible for the costs incurred by the Contractor in providing the service.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A member with private insurance is not required to utilize CRSA. This includes members with Medicare<br />
whether they are enrolled in Medicare FFS or a Medicare Managed Care plan. If a member uses the private<br />
insurance network or Medicare for a CRS-covered condition, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable<br />
deductibles and copayments. If the member is on Medicare, the ACOM <i>Medicare Cost Sharing for Members<br />
in Traditional Fee for Service Medicare Policy</i> and <i>Medicare Cost Sharing for Members in Medicare<br />
Managed Care Plans Policy</i> shall apply. When the private insurance or Medicare is exhausted, or certain<br />
annual or lifetime limits are reached with respect to CRS-covered conditions, the Contractor shall refer the<br />
member to CRSA for determination of eligibility for CRS services. If the member with private insurance or<br />
Medicare chooses to enroll with CRS, CRS becomes the secondary payer responsible for all applicable<br />
deductibles and copayments. The Contractor is not responsible to provide services in instances when the<br />
 CRS-eligible member who has no primary insurance or Medicare refuses to receive CRS-covered services through<br />
the CRS program. If the Contractor becomes aware that a member with a CRS-covered condition refuses to<br />
participate in the CRS application process or refuses to receive services through the CRS Program, the member<br />
may be billed by the provider in accordance with AHCCCS regulations regarding billing for unauthorized<br />
services.</font></p>

AHCCCS established performance measures. Complete descriptions of the AHCCCS clinical quality<br />
Performance Measure can be found in the most recently published reports of acute-care performance measures<br />
located on the AHCCCS website. AHCCCS uses Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (also<br />
known as the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, or HEDIS) technical specifications from the<br />
National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) for all clinical quality performance Measures. The only<br />
exception to AHCCCS&rsquo; use of the HEDIS methodology is in the performance measure titled &ldquo;EPSDT<br />
Participation&rdquo;. AHCCCS bases the measurement of EPSDT Participation on the methodology established in<br />
CMS &ldquo;Form 416&rdquo; which can be found on the CMS website (www.cms.hhs.gov).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Contractors must comply with national performance measures and levels that may be identified and developed<br />
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in consultation with AHCCCS and/or other relevant<br />
stakeholders. CMS has been working in partnership with states in developing core performance measures for<br />
Medicaid and SCHIP programs. The current AHCCCS-established performance measures may be subject to<br />
change when these core measures are finalized and implemented.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS intends to implement a hybrid methodology for collecting and reporting Performance Measure rates,<br />
as allowed by NCQA, for selected HEDIS measures. Contractors shall collect data from medical records and<br />
provide these data with supporting documentation, as instructed by AHCCCS, for each hybrid measure as<br />
requested. The number of records that each Contractor will be required to collect will be based on HEDIS<br />
sampling guidelines and may be affected by the Contractor&rsquo;s previous rate for the measure being collected.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS may begin implementation of the hybrid methodology with the following measures: Adolescent<br />
Immunizations, Cervical Cancer Screening and Timeliness of Prenatal Care. AHCCCS may implement hybrid<br />
methodology for collecting and reporting additional measures in this, or future, contract years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In addition, the Contractor must have in place a process for internal monitoring of Performance Measure rates,<br />
using a standard methodology established or adopted by AHCCCS, for each required Performance Measure.<br />
The Contractor&rsquo;s Quality Assessment/Performance Improvement Program will report its performance on an<br />
ongoing basis to its Administration. It also will report this Performance Measure data to AHCCCS in<br />
conjunction with its Quarterly EPSDT and Adult Quarterly Monitoring Report.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A Contractor must show demonstrable and sustained improvement toward meeting AHCCCS Performance<br />
Standards. AHCCCS may impose sanctions on Contractors that do not show statistically significant<br />
improvement in a measure rate and require the Contractor to demonstrate that they are allocating increased<br />
administrative resources to improving rates for a particular measure or service area. AHCCCS also may<br />
require a corrective action plan and may sanction any Contractor that shows a statistically significant decrease<br />
in its rate, even if it meets or exceeds the Minimum Performance Standard.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">An evidence-based corrective action plan must be received by AHCCCS within 30 days of receipt of<br />
notification of the deficiency from AHCCCS. This plan must be approved by AHCCCS prior to<br />
implementation. AHCCCS may conduct one or more follow-up on-site reviews to verify compliance with a<br />
corrective action plan.</font></p>

</font></b><font color="black">Contractor Performance is evaluated annually on the AHCCCS-reported rate for each measure. Rates<br />
for measures that include only members under 21 years of age are reported and evaluated separately<br />
for Title XIX and Title XXI eligibility groups.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The MPS is based on the national HEDIS Medicaid mean for 2006 as reported by NCQA or, if the<br />
most recent AHCCCS statewide average is greater than the national Medicaid mean, the MPS is based<br />
on the AHCCCS statewide average for Medicaid members.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Goals are based on Healthy People 2010 Objectives; if there was no comparable objective set for a<br />
particular measure, the most recent HEDIS 90</font>th percentile rate for Medicaid plans nationally was used<br />
as the benchmark.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">(*) AHCCCS will continue to measure and report results of these individual antigens; however, a<br />
Contractor may not be held accountable for specific Performance Standards unless AHCCCS<br />
determines that completion of a specific antigen or antigens is affecting overall completion of the<br />
childhood immunization series.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">(1) NCQA is in the process of making revisions to the measure, and current AHCCCS data is not yet<br />
available.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor shall participate in immunization audits, at intervals specified by AHCCCS, based on random<br />
sampling to verify the immunization status of members at 24 months of age. If records are missing for more<br />
than 5 percent of the Contractor&rsquo;s final sample, the Contractor is subject to sanctions by AHCCCS. An<br />
External Quality Review Organization (EQRO) may conduct a study to validate the Contractor&rsquo;s reported<br />
rates.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In addition, AHCCCS shall measure and report the Contractor&rsquo;s EPSDT Participation Rate, utilizing the CMS<br />
416 methodology. The Contractor must take affirmative steps to increase member participation in the EPSDT<br />
program. The EPSDT participation rate is the number of children younger than 21 years receiving at least one<br />
medical screen during the contract year, compared to the number of children expected to receive at least one<br />
medical screen. The number of children expected to receive at least one medical screen is based on the<br />
AHCCCS EPSDT periodicity schedule and the average period of eligibility.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor shall have in place a written grievance system process for subcontractors, enrollees and non-<br />
contracted providers, which defines their rights regarding disputed matters with the Contractor. The<br />
Contractor&rsquo;s grievance system for enrollees includes a grievance process (the procedures for addressing<br />
enrollee grievances), an appeals process and access to the state&rsquo;s fair hearing process. The Contractor shall<br />
provide the appropriate personnel to establish implement and maintain the necessary functions related to the<br />
grievance systems process. Refer to Attachments H(1) and H(2) for <i>Enrollee Grievance System</i> and <i>Provider<br />
Grievance System Standards and Policy</i>, respectively.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor may delegate the grievance system process to subcontractors, however, the Contractor must<br />
ensure that the delegated entity complies with applicable Federal and State laws, regulations and policies,<br />
including, but not limited to 42 CFR Part 438 Subpart F. The Contractor shall remain responsible for<br />
compliance with all requirements. The Contractor shall also ensure that it timely provides written information<br />
to both enrollees and providers, which clearly explains the grievance system requirements. This information<br />
must include a description of: the right to a state fair hearing, the method for obtaining a state fair hearing, the<br />
rules that govern representation at the hearing, the right to file grievances, appeals and claim disputes, the<br />
requirements and timeframes for filing grievances, appeals and claim disputes, the availability of assistance in<br />
the filing process, the toll-free numbers that the enrollee can use to file a grievance or appeal by phone, that<br />
benefits will continue when requested by the enrollee in an appeal or state fair hearing request concerning<br />
certain actions which are timely filed, that the enrollee may be required to pay the cost of services furnished<br />
during the appeal/hearing process if the final decision is adverse to the enrollee, and that a provider may file an<br />
appeal on behalf of an enrollee with the enrollee&rsquo;s written consent. Information to enrollees must meet cultural<br />
competency and limited English proficiency requirements as specified in Section D, Paragraph 18, Member<br />
Information, and Section D, Paragraph 20, Cultural Competency.</font></p>

services for the representation of the Contractor in all issues relating to the grievance system and any other<br />
matters arising under this contract which rise to the level of administrative hearing or a judicial proceeding.<br />
Unless there is an agreement with the State in advance, the Contractor shall be responsible for all attorney fees<br />

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor shall develop and maintain a provider network that is designed to support a medical home for<br />
members and sufficient to provide all covered services to AHCCCS members [42 CFR 438.206(b)(1)]. It shall<br />
ensure covered services are provided promptly and are reasonably accessible in terms of location and hours of<br />
operation [42 CFR 438.206(c)(1)(i) and (ii)]. There shall be sufficient personnel for the provision of covered<br />
services, including emergency medical care on a 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week basis [42 CFR 438.206(c)(1)(iii)].</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The network shall be sufficient to provide covered services within designated time and distance limits. For<br />
Maricopa and Pima Counties only, this includes a network such that 95% of its members residing within the<br />
boundary area of metropolitan Phoenix and Tucson do not have to travel more than 5 miles to visit a PCP, dentist<br />
or pharmacy. Additionally, a Contractor in Maricopa and/or Pima counties must have at least one contracted<br />
hospital in each of the service districts specified in Attachment B. In rural counties the contractor must have a<br />
sufficient network of physicians to provide adequate inpatient and outpatient services to the Contractor&rsquo;s<br />
members.. For inpatient services Hospitalists may satisfy this requirement. See Attachment B for GSA<br />
specific requirements.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor is expected to design a network that provides a geographically convenient flow of patients<br />
among network providers. The provider network shall be designed to reflect the needs and service<br />
requirements of AHCCCS&rsquo;s culturally and linguistically diverse member population. The Contractor shall<br />
design their provider networks to maximize the availability of community based primary care and specialty<br />
care access and that reduces utilization of emergency services, one day hospital admissions, hospital based<br />
outpatient surgeries when lower cost surgery centers are available, and hospitalization for preventable medical<br />
problems. The Contractor must provide a comprehensive provider network that ensures its membership has<br />
access at least equal to community norms. Services shall be as accessible to AHCCCS members in terms of<br />
timeliness, amount, duration and scope as those services are available to non-AHCCCS persons within the same<br />
service area [42 CFR 438.210(a)(2)]. The Contractor is expected to consider the full spectrum of care when<br />
developing its network. The Contractor is encouraged to have available non-emergent after-hours physician or<br />
primary care services within its network. The Contractor must also consider communities whose residents<br />
typically receive care in neighboring states/border communities. If the Contractor is unable to provide any<br />
services locally, it must notify AHCCCS and shall provide reasonable alternatives for members to access care.<br />
These alternatives must be approved by AHCCCS. If the Contractor&rsquo;s network is unable to provide medically<br />
necessary services required under contract, the Contractor must adequately and timely cover these services<br />
through an out of network provider until a network provider is contracted. The Contractor and out of network<br />
provider must coordinate with respect to authorization and payment issues in these circumstances [42 CFR<br />
438.206(b)(4) and (5)].</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor must pay all AHCCCS registered Arizona Early Intervention Program (AzEIP) providers,<br />
regardless of their contract status with the Contractor, when Individual Family Service Plans identify and meet<br />
the requirement for medically necessary EPSDT covered services.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor is also encouraged to develop non-financial incentive programs to increase participation in its<br />
provider network.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS is committed to workforce development and support of the medical residency and dental student<br />
training programs in the state of Arizona. AHCCCS expects the Contractor to support these efforts. AHCCCS<br />
encourages plans to contract with or otherwise support the many Graduate Medical Education (GME)<br />
Residency Training Programs currently operating in the state and to investigate opportunities for resident<br />
participation in Contractor medical management and committee activities. In the event of a contract<br />
termination between the Contractor and a Graduate Medical Education Residency Training Program or training<br />
site, the Contractor may not remove members from that program in such a manner as to harm the stability of<br />
the program. AHCCCS reserves the right to determine what constitutes risk to the program. If a Residency<br />
Training Program is in need of patients in order to maintain accreditation, AHCCCS may require a Contractor<br />
within the program&rsquo;s GSA to make members available to the program. Further, the Contractor must attempt to<br />
contract with graduating residents and providers that are opening new practices in, or relocating to, Arizona,<br />
especially in rural or underserved areas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor shall not discriminate with respect to participation in the AHCCCS program, reimbursement or<br />
indemnification against any provider based solely on the provider&rsquo;s type of licensure or certification [42 CFR<br />
438.12(a)(1)]. In addition, the Contractor must not discriminate against particular providers that service high-risk<br />
populations or specialize in conditions that require costly treatment [42 CFR 438.214(c)]. This provision,<br />
however, does not prohibit the Contractor from limiting provider participation to the extent necessary to meet the<br />
needs of the Contractor&rsquo;s members. This provision also does not interfere with measures established by the<br />
Contractor to control costs consistent with its responsibilities under this contract [42 CFR 438.12(b)(1)]. If a<br />
Contractor declines to include individual or groups of providers in its network, it must give the affected providers<br />
timely written notice of the reason for its decision [42 CFR 438.12(a)(1)]. The Contractor may not include<br />
providers excluded from participation in Federal health care programs, under either section 1128 or section<br />
1128A of the Social Security Act [42 CFR 438.214(d)].</font></p>

policy, process, protocol, etc.) that could have an impact on or reasonably be foreseen to have an impact on<br />
more than 5% of the members and/or providers. The Contractor must submit the request for approval of<br />

implementation of the change. The request should contain, at a minimum, information regarding the nature of<br />
the change; the reason for the change; methods of communication to be used; and the anticipated effective<br />

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">All material changes in the Contractor's provider network must be approved in advance by AHCCCS, Division of<br />

affects, or can reasonably be foreseen to affect, the Contractor's ability to meet the performance and network<br />
standards as described in this contract. It also includes any change that would cause more than 5% of members in<br />
the GSA to change the location where services are received or rendered. The Contractor must submit the request<br />
for approval of material change, including draft notification to affected members, 60 days prior to the expected<br />
implementation of the change. The request must include a description of any short-term gaps identified as a<br />
result of the change and the alternatives that will be used to fill them. If AHCCCS does not respond within 30<br />

consider the PCP&rsquo;s total panel size (i.e., AHCCCS and non-AHCCCS patients) when making this<br />
determination. AHCCCS members shall not comprise the majority of a PCP&rsquo;s panel of patients. AHCCCS<br />
shall inform the Contractor when a PCP has a panel of more than 1,800 AHCCCS members (assigned by a<br />
single Contractor or multiple Contractors), to assist in the assessment of the size of their panel. This<br />

there is a medically necessary reason. When a new member has been assigned to the Contractor, the<br />
Contractor shall inform the member in writing of his enrollment and of his PCP assignment within 10 days of<br />
the Contractor's receipt of notification of assignment by AHCCCS. The Contractor shall include with the<br />

submitted. AHCCCS will validate the submission of applicable voids and replacement encounters upon completion of any approved recoupment that meets the qualifications of this section. All replaced or voided encounters must reach adjudicated status within 120 days of
the approval of the recoupment. The Contractor should refer to the ACOM <i>Recoupment Request Policy</i> and AHCCCS<i>Encounter Reporting User Manual</i> for further guidance.</font></p>

clean claims are adjudicated within 30 days of receipt of the clean claim and 99% are adjudicated within 60 days of receipt of the clean claim.&nbsp; Additionally, unless a shorter time period is specified in contract, the Contractor shall not pay a claim initially
submitted more than 6 months after date of service or pay a clean claim submitted more than 12 months after date of service; except as directed by AHCCCS or otherwise noted in this contract</font>.&nbsp; Claim payment requirements pertain to both contracted and
non-contracted providers.&nbsp; The receipt date of the claim is the date stamp on the claim or the date electronically received.&nbsp; The receipt date is the day the claim is received at the Contractor&rsquo;s specified claim mailing address.&nbsp; The paid date of
the claim is the date on the check or other form of payment [42 CFR 447.45(d)]. Claims submission deadlines shall be calculated from the claim end date or the effective date of eligibility posting, whichever is later as stated in A.R.S. 36-2904.H.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Effective for all non-hospital clean claims, in the absence of a contract specifying other late payment terms, a Contractor is required to pay interest on late payments.&nbsp; Late claims payments are those that are paid after
45 days of receipt of the clean claim (as defined in this contract).&nbsp; In grievance situations, interest shall be paid back to the date interest would have started to accrue beyond the applicable 45 day requirement.&nbsp; Interest shall be at the rate of ten per
cent per annum, unless a different rate is stated in a written contract.&nbsp; In the absence of interest payment terms in a subcontract, interest shall accrue starting on the first day after a clean claim is contracted to be paid.&nbsp; For hospital clean claims, a
slow payment penalty shall be paid in accordance with A.R.S. 2903.01.&nbsp; When interest is paid, the Contractor must report the interest as directed in the AHCCCS<i>Encounter Reporting User Manual.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If the Contractor or the Director's Decision reverses a decision to deny, limit, or delay authorization of services, and the member received the disputed services while an appeal was pending, the Contractor shall process a
claim for payment from the provider in a manner consistent with the Contractor's or Director's Decision and applicable statutes, rules, policies, and contract terms. The provider shall have 90 days from the date of the reversed decision to submit a clean claim to the
Contractor for payment. For all claims submitted as a result of a reversed decision, the Contractor is prohibited from denying claims for untimeliness if they are submitted within the 90 day timeframe. Contractors are also prohibited from denying claims submitted as
a result of a reversed decision because the member failed to request continuation of services during the appeals/hearing process: a member's failure to request continuation of services during the appeals/hearing process is not a valid basis to deny the
claim.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS will require the Contractor to participate in an AHCCCS workgroup to develop uniform guidelines for standardizing hospital outpatient and outpatient provider claim requirements, including billing rules and documentation

between the Contractor and hospitals in Maricopa and Pima counties to establish reimbursement levels, terms and conditions.&nbsp; Subcontracts shall be negotiated by the Contractor and hospitals to cover operational concerns, such as timeliness of claims submission
and payment, payment of discounts or penalties and legal resolution which may, as an option, include establishing arbitration procedures.&nbsp; These negotiated subcontracts shall remain under close scrutiny by AHCCCS to ensure availability of quality services within
specific service districts, equity of related party interests and reasonableness of rates.&nbsp; The general provisions of this program encompass acute care hospital services and outpatient hospital services that result in an admission.&nbsp; The Contractor, upon
request, shall make available to AHCCCS, all hospital subcontracts and amendments.&nbsp; For non-emergency patient-days, the Contractor shall ensure that at least 65% of its members use contracted hospitals.&nbsp; AHCCCS reserves the right to subsequently adjust the
65% standard.&nbsp; Further, if in AHCCCS&rsquo;s judgment the number of emergency days at a particular non-contracted hospital becomes significant, AHCCCS may require a subcontract at that hospital. In accordance with R9-22-718, unless otherwise negotiated by both

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Pursuant to federal and state law, AHCCCS is the payer of last resort except under limited situations.&nbsp; This means AHCCCS shall be used as a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment
have been exhausted.&nbsp; The Contractor shall coordinate benefits in accordance with 42 CFR 433.135 et seq., ARS 36-2903, and A.A.C. R9-22-1001 et seq. so that costs for services otherwise payable by the Contractor are cost avoided or recovered from a liable
party.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; shall be interpreted to mean &ldquo;Contractor&rdquo; for purposes of complying with the federal regulations referenced above. The Contractor may require subcontractors to be responsible for coordination of benefits for
services provided pursuant to this contract.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The two methods used in the coordination of benefits are cost avoidance and post payment recovery.&nbsp; The Contractor shall use these methods as described in A.A.C. R9-22-1001 et seq. and federal and state law.&nbsp; See
also Section D, Paragraph 60, Medicare Services and Cost Sharing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><u><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Cost Avoidance</font></u></i></b><i><u>:</u>&nbsp;</i> The Contractor shall take reasonable measures to determine all legally liable parties.&nbsp; This refers to any individual, entity or program that is or may be
liable to pay all or part of the expenditures for covered services. The Contractor shall cost-avoid a claim if it has established the probable existence of a liable party at the time the claim is filed. Establishing liability takes place when the Contractor receives
confirmation that another party is, by statute, contract, or agreement, legally responsible for the payment of a claim for a healthcare item or service delivered to a member. If the probable existence of a party&rsquo;s liability cannot be established the Contractor
must adjudicate the claim. The Contractor must then utilize post payment recovery which is described in further detail below.&nbsp; If the Administration determines that the Contractor is not actively engaged in cost avoidance activities the Contractor shall be
subject to sanctions in an amount not less than <b>three times</b> the amount that could have been cost avoided.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor shall not deny a claim for timeliness if the untimely claim submission results from a provider&rsquo;s efforts to determine the extent of liability.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If a third party insurer other than Medicare requires the member to pay any copayments, coinsurance or deductible, the Contractor is responsible for making these payments, even if the services are provided outside of the
Contractor network.&nbsp; The Contractor is not responsible for paying coinsurance and deductibles that are in excess of what the Contractor would have paid for the entire service per a written contract with the provider performing the service, or the AHCCCS FFS
payment equivalent when no contract exists. If the Contractor refers the member for services to a third-party insurer, other than Medicare, and the insurer requires payment in advance of all copayments, coinsurance and deductibles, the Contractor must make such
payments in advance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Members with CRS condition:</font></i> A member with private insurance or Medicare coverage is not required to utilize CRSA. This includes members with Medicare whether they are enrolled in Medicare FFS or a Medicare
Managed Care Plan. If the member uses the private insurance network for a CRS-covered condition, the Contractor is responsible for all applicable deductibles and copayments.&nbsp; However, if the member has Medicare coverage, the AHCCCS Policy 201- <i>Medicare Cost
Sharing for Members in Traditional Fee for Service Medicare</i> and Policy 202 - <i>Medicare Cost Sharing for Members in Medicare Managed Care Plans</i> shall apply. When the private insurance or Medicare is exhausted, or certain annual or lifetime limits are reached
with respect to CRS-covered conditions, the Contractor shall refer the member to CRSA for determination for CRS services. If the member with private insurance or Medicare chooses to enroll with CRS, CRS becomes the secondary payer responsible for all applicable
deductibles and copayments. The Contractor is not responsible to provide services in instances when the CRS-eligible member, who has no primary insurance or Medicare, refuses to receive CRS-covered services through the CRS Program.&nbsp; If the Contractor becomes
aware that a member with a CRS-covered condition refuses to participate in the CRS application process or refuses to receive services through the CRS Program, the member may be billed by the provider in accordance with AHCCCS regulations regarding billing for
unauthorized services.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><i><u><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Post-payment Recoveries</font></u></i></b><i><u>:</u>&nbsp;</i> Post-payment recovery is necessary in cases where the Contractor has not established the probable existence of a liable party at the time services were
rendered or paid for, or was unable to cost-avoid. The following sections set forth requirements for Contractor recovery actions including recoupment activities, other recoveries and total plan case requirements.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Recoupments</font></i>: The Contractor must follow the protocols established in the ACOM <i>Recoupment Request Policy</i>. The Contractor must void encounters for claims that are recouped in full.&nbsp; For recoupments that
result in an adjusted claim value, the Contractor must submit replacement encounters.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Other Recoveries</font></i>: The Contractor shall identify the existence of potentially liable parties through the use of trauma code edits, utilizing diagnostic codes 799.9 and 800 to 999.9 (excluding code 994.6), and
other procedures.&nbsp; The Contractor shall not pursue recovery in the following circumstances, unless the case has been referred to the Contractor by AHCCCS or AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative:</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restitution Recovery<br />

Estate Recovery<br />
Special Treatment Trust Recovery</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Upon identification of any of the above situations, the Contractor shall promptly report cases to AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative for determination of a &ldquo;total plan&rdquo; case. The Contractor is responsible for
all recovery actions for a &ldquo;total plan&rdquo; case. A total plan case is a case where payments for services rendered to the member are exclusively the responsibility of the Contractor; no reinsurance or fee-for-service payments are involved. By contrast, a
&ldquo;joint&rdquo; case is one where fee-for-service payments and/or reinsurance payments are involved. In joint cases, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative within 10 business days of the identification of a liable party. Failure to
report these cases may result in one of the remedies specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions. The Contractor shall cooperate with AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative in all collection efforts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Total Plan Case Requirements</font></i>: In &ldquo;total plan&rdquo; cases, the Contractor is responsible for performing all research, investigation, the mandatory filing of initial liens on cases that exceed $250, lien
amendments, lien releases, and payment of other related costs in accordance with A.R.S. 36-2915 and A.R.S. 36-2916. The Contractor shall use the AHCCCS-approved casualty recovery correspondence when filing liens and when corresponding to others in regard to casualty
recovery.&nbsp; The Contractor may retain up to 100% of its recovery collections if all of the following conditions exist:</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Total collections received do not exceed the total amount of the Contractor&rsquo;s financial<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liability for the member;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. There are no payments made by AHCCCS related to fee-for-service, reinsurance or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administrative costs (i.e., lien filing , etc.); and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Such recovery is not prohibited by state or Federal law.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Prior to negotiating a settlement on a total plan case, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCS to ensure that there is no reinsurance or fee-for-service payment that has been made by AHCCCS. Failure to report these cases prior to
negotiating a settlement amount may result in one of the remedies specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Total Plan Cases</font></i>: the Contractor shall report settlement information to AHCCCS, utilizing the AHCCCS-approved casualty recovery Notification of Settlement form, within 10 business days from the settlement date.
Failure to report these cases may result in one of the remedies specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Joint Cases</font></i>: AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative is responsible for performing all research, investigation and payment of lien-related costs, subsequent to the referral of any and all relevant case
information to AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative by the Contractor. In joint cases, AHCCCS&rsquo;s authorized representative is also responsible for negotiating and acting in the best interest of all parties to obtain a reasonable settlement in joint cases and
may compromise a settlement in order to maximize overall reimbursement, net of legal and other costs.&nbsp; The Contractor will be responsible for their prorated share of the contingency fee.&nbsp; The Contractor&rsquo;s share of the contingency fee will be deducted
from the settlement proceeds prior to AHCCCS remitting the settlement to the Contractor.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><b><u><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Other Reporting Requirements</font></u></b><u>:</u>&nbsp; If a Contractor discovers the probable existence of a liable party that is not known to AHCCCS, the Contractor must report the information to the AHCCCS
contracted vendor not later than 10 days from the date of discovery. In addition, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCS of any known changes in coverage within deadlines and in a format prescribed by AHCCCS in the Technical Interface Guidelines. Failure to report these
cases may result in one of the remedies specified in Section D, Paragraph 72, Sanctions.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">At AHCCCS&rsquo;s request, the Contractor shall provide an electronic extract of the Casualty cases, including open and closed cases.&nbsp; Data elements include, but are not limited to: the member&rsquo;s first and last name;

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS has members enrolled who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare.&nbsp; These members are referred to as &ldquo;dual eligible&rdquo;.&nbsp; Generally, the Contractor is responsible for payment of Medicare
coinsurance and/or deductibles for covered services provided to dual eligible members.&nbsp; However, there are different cost-sharing responsibilities that apply to dual eligible members based on a variety of factors.&nbsp; Unless prior approval is obtained from
AHCCCS, the Contractor must limit their cost sharing responsibility according to the ACOM <i>Medicare Cost Sharing Policy</i>.&nbsp; The Contractor shall have no cost sharing obligation if the Medicare payment exceeds what the Contractor would have paid for the same
service of a non-Medicare member. Please refer to Section D, Paragraph 10, Scope of Services, for information regarding prescription medication for Medicare Part D.</font></p>

of encounter validation studies is to compare recorded utilization information from a medical record or other source with the Contractor&rsquo;s submitted encounter data.&nbsp; Any and all covered services may be validated as part of these studies.&nbsp; Encounter
validation studies will be conducted at least yearly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS may revise study methodology, timelines, and sanction amounts based on agency review or as a result of consultations with CMS.&nbsp; The Contractor will be notified in writing of any significant change in study
methodology.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS will notify the Contractor in writing of the sanction amounts and of the selected data needed for encounter validation studies.&nbsp; The Contractor will have 90 days to submit the requested data to AHCCCS.&nbsp; In the
case of medical records requests, the Contractor&rsquo;s failure to provide AHCCCS with the records requested within 90 days may result in a sanction of $1,000 per missing medical record.&nbsp; If AHCCCS does not receive a sufficient number of medical records from
the Contractor to select a statistically valid sample for a study, the Contractor may be sanctioned up to 5% of its annual capitation payment.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

daily enrollment transaction update, that is run immediately prior to the monthly enrollment and capitation transaction, is referred to as the "last daily" and will contain all rate code changes made for the prospective month, as well as any new enrollments and
disenrollments as of the 1<sup>st</sup> of the prospective month.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">AHCCCS also produces a daily Manual Payment Transaction, which identifies enrollment or disenrollment activity that was not included on the daily enrollment transaction update due to internal edits.&nbsp; The Contractor shall
use the Manual Payment Transaction in addition to the daily enrollment transaction update to update its member records.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">On a monthly basis AHCCCS provides the Contractor with an electronic file of all Acute members who must complete a review of their eligibility in order to maintain enrollment with the Contractor. AHCCCS strongly encourages the
Contractor to utilize this file to support member retention efforts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">A weekly capitation transaction will be produced to provide the Contractor with member-level capitation payment information.&nbsp; This file will show changes to the prospective capitation payments, as sent in the monthly
file, resulting from enrollment changes that occur after the monthly file is produced.&nbsp; This file will also identify mass adjustments to and/or manual capitation payments that occurred at AHCCCS after the monthly file is produced.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The monthly enrollment and monthly capitation transaction updates are generally produced two days before the end of every month.&nbsp; The update will identify the total active population for the Contractor as of the first day
of the next month.&nbsp; These updates contain the information used by AHCCCS to produce the monthly capitation payment for the next month.&nbsp; The Contractor must reconcile their member files with the AHCCCS monthly update.&nbsp; After reconciling the monthly
update information, the Contractor will record the results of the reconciliation, which will be made available upon request, and will resume posting daily updates beginning with the last two days of the month.&nbsp; The last two daily updates are different from the
regular daily updates in that they pay and/or recoup capitation into the next month.&nbsp; If the Contractor detects an error through the monthly update process, the Contractor shall notify AHCCCS, Information Services Division.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">19) TEMPORARY MANAGEMENT/OPERATION OF A CONTRACTOR AND TERMINATION</font></b><b><br />
</b><b><i>Temporary Management and Operation of a Contractor:</i></b> Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, 42 CFR 438.700 et seq. and State Law ARS &sect;36-2903, AHCCCSA is authorized to impose temporary management for a Contractor under certain conditions.
Under federal law, temporary management may be imposed if AHCCCS determines that there is continued egregious behavior by the Contractor, including but not limited to the following: substantial failure to provide medically necessary services the Contractor is
required to provide; imposition on enrollees premiums or charges that exceed those permitted by AHCCCSA, discrimination among enrollees on the basis of health status or need for health care services; misrepresentation or falsification of information to AHCCCSA or
CMS; misrepresentation or falsification of information furnished to an enrollee or provider; distribution of marketing materials that have not been approved by AHCCCS or that are false or misleading; or behavior contrary to any requirements of Sections 1903(m) or
1932 of the Social Security Act. Temporary management may also be imposed if AHCCCSA determines that there is substantial risk to enrollees&rsquo; health or that temporary management is necessary to ensure the health of enrollees while the Contractor is correcting
the deficiencies noted above or until there is an orderly transition or reorganization of the Contractor. Under federal law, temporary management is mandatory if AHCCCSA determines that the Contractor has repeatedly failed to meet substantive requirements in Sections
1903(m) or 1932 of the Social Security Act. In these situations, AHCCCSA shall not delay imposition of temporary management to provide a hearing before imposing this sanction.</p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">State law ARS &sect;36-2903 authorizes AHCCCSA to operate a Contractor as specified in this contract. In addition to the bases specified in 42 CFR 438.700 et seq., AHCCCSA may directly operate the Contractor if, in the
judgment of AHCCCSA, the Contractor's performance is in material breach of the contract or the Contractor is insolvent. Under these circumstances, AHCCCSA may directly operate the Contractor to assure delivery of care to members enrolled with the Contractor until
cure by the Contractor of its breach, by demonstrated financial solvency or until the successful transition of those members to other Contractors. <u></u>Prior to operation of the Contractor by AHCCCSA pursuant to state statute, the Contractor shall have the
opportunity for a hearing. If AHCCCSA determines that emergency action is required, operation of the Contractor may take place prior to hearing. Operation by AHCCCSA shall occur only as long as it is necessary to assure delivery of uninterrupted care to members, to
accomplish orderly transition of those members to other Contractors, or until the Contractor reorganizes or otherwise corrects contract performance failure.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If AHCCCS undertakes direct operation of the Contractor, AHCCCS, through designees appointed by the Director, shall be vested with full and exclusive power of management and control of the Contractor as necessary to ensure the

assistants, to execute any instrument in the name of the Contractor, to commence, defend and conduct in its name any action or proceeding in which the Contractor may be a third party; such powers shall only apply with respect to activities occurring after AHCCCS

other contracts. In such situations, AHCCCSA reserves the right to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches of contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received. The Contracting Officer shall mail written notice of the termination and the
reason(s) for it to the Contractor by certified mail, return receipt requested. Pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and 42 CFR 438.708, AHCCCSA shall provide the contractor with a pre-termination hearing before termination of the contract.</font></p>

Offeror. No alterations or changes are permitted, except for shaded areas which identify the Offeror. The Offeror may print the form on its letterhead or insert its name or logo in the box at the top of the forms. The completed LOI or an executed contract will be
acceptable evidence of an Offeror&rsquo;s proposed network.</font></p>

be obtained for each service site.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The algorithm employs a data table and a formula to assign cases (a case may be a member or a household of members) to Contractors using the target percentages developed.&nbsp; The algorithm data table consists of all the
geographic service areas (GSA) in the state, all Contractors serving each GSA, and the target percentages by risk group within each GSA.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Contractor farthest away from its target percentage within a GSA and risk group, the largest negative difference, is assigned the next case for that GSA.&nbsp; The equation used is:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (t/T) &ndash; P = d</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">t =&nbsp; The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, for the Contractor<br />
T =&nbsp; The total members assigned to the GSA, per risk group category, all Contractors combined<br />
P =&nbsp; The target percentage of members per risk group for the Contractor<br />
d =&nbsp; The difference</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The algorithm is calculated after each assignment to give a new difference for each Contractor.&nbsp; When more than one Contractor has the same difference, and their differences are greater than all other Contractors, the
Contractor with the lowest Health Plan I.D. Number will be assigned the case.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Assignment by the algorithm applies to:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

after the member moves to a new GSA<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and did not choose a new Contractor within the prescribed time
limits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">All Contractors, within a given geographic service area (GSA) and for each risk group, will have a placement in the algorithm and will receive members accordingly.&nbsp; A Contractor with a more favorable target percentage in
the algorithm will receive proportionally more members.&nbsp; Conversely, a Contractor with a lower target percentage in the algorithm will receive proportionally fewer members.&nbsp; The initial algorithm formula favors Contractors with both lower awarded capitation
rates and higher scores on the Program Component of the proposal.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In future contract years, AHCCCS may adjust the auto-assignment algorithm in consideration of Contractors&rsquo; clinical performance measure results when calculating target percentages. Ranking in the algorithm may be
weighted based on the number of Performance Measures for which a Contractor is meeting the current AHCCCS Minimum Performance Standard (MPS) as a percentage of the total number of measures utilized in the calculation. AHCCCS will determine the Performance Measures
used to evaluate Contractor performance and apply the criterion universally when making the adjustment.</font></p>
