such Loan is made or such other Obligations are incurred to the date paid at a rate equal to the
daily Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal plus four and one-half percent (4.5%).
This rate may change daily and any change in the interest rate will take effect on the following

or any other Loan Document, Borrower shall not be required to pay, and Lender shall not be
permitted to collect, any amount of interest in excess of the maximum amount of interest permitted
by applicable law (&#147;Excess Interest&#148;). If any Excess Interest is provided for or determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have been provided for in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, then in such event: (1)&nbsp;the provisions of this subsection shall govern and control; (2)
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay any Excess Interest; (3)&nbsp;any Excess Interest that Lender may
have received hereunder shall be, at Lender&#146;s option, (a)&nbsp;applied as a credit against the
outstanding principal balance of the Obligations or accrued and unpaid interest (not to exceed the
maximum amount permitted by law), (b)&nbsp;refunded to the payor thereof, or (c)&nbsp;any combination of the
foregoing; (4)&nbsp;the interest rate(s) provided for herein shall be automatically reduced to the
maximum lawful rate allowed from time to time under applicable law (the &#147;Maximum Rate&#148;), and this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been and shall be, reformed and
modified to reflect such reduction; and (5)&nbsp;Borrower shall not have any action against Lender for
any damages arising out of the payment or collection of any Excess Interest. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if for any period of time interest on any Obligations is calculated at the Maximum Rate
rather than the applicable rate under this Agreement, and thereafter such applicable rate becomes
less than the Maximum Rate, the rate of interest payable on such Obligations shall remain at the
Maximum Rate until Lender shall have received the amount of interest which Lender would have
received during such period on such Obligations had the rate of interest not been limited to the
Maximum Rate during such period.
