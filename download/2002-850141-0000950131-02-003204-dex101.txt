       one or more commercial banks or other financial institutions (any such
       bank or other financial institution being called an "Augmenting Lender"),
       which may include any Lender, to extend Commitments or increase their
       existing Commitments in an aggregate amount up to, but not greater than,
       the requested increase, provided that each Augmenting Lender, if not
       already a Lender hereunder (i) shall extend a new Commitment of not less
       than $5,000,000, (ii) shall execute all such documentation as the
       Administrative Agent shall specify to evidence its status as a Lender
       hereunder and (iii) shall be consented to by the Administrative Agent. If
       (and only if) Lenders (including Augmenting Lenders) shall have agreed to
       increase their aggregate Commitments or to extend new Commitments in an
       aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 in the aggregate, such
       increases and such new Commitments shall become effective on the date
       agreed to by the Borrower, the Augmenting Lenders and the Administrative
       Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the aggregate
       Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective
       under this paragraph unless, on the date of such increase, the conditions
       set forth in Section 9.2 shall be satisfied (with all references in such
       paragraphs to a Loan being deemed to be references to such increase) and
       the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect
       dated such date and executed by an Authorized Officer of the Borrower.

              Upon the effectiveness of any increase pursuant to this Section
       2.1.2 of the aggregate Commitments and any resulting adjustment in the
       Funding Percentage, the Lenders and the Augmenting Lenders will purchase
       from each other and sell to each other outstanding Loans sufficient to
       cause the outstanding Loans of each Lender and Augmenting Lender to equal
       its Funding Percentage (as so adjusted) of the aggregate outstanding
       Loans. Such purchase and sale shall be made pursuant to Section 12.2
       except that no minimum amount shall be required, no processing fee shall
       be charged and, if any Lender shall suffer a loss or incur an expense as
       a result of the effectiveness of such purchase or sale being during an
       Interest Period, the Borrower shall reimburse such Lender the amount of
       such loss or expense. Each such Lender shall furnish the Borrower with a
       certificate setting forth the basis for determining the amount to be paid
       to it hereunder.

              SECTION 2.2 Types of Loans. The Loans shall be denominated as Base
Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans (each being herein called a "Type" of Loan), as
the Borrower shall specify in the related Borrowing Request pursuant to Section
2.3 or Continuation/Conversion Notice pursuant to Section 4.5. Base Rate Loans
and Eurodollar Loans may be outstanding at

                                       15

<PAGE>

the same time, provided that (a) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, not more than
three (3) different Interest Periods shall be outstanding at any one time for
all such Loans, and (b) the Borrower shall specify Types of Loans and Interest
Periods such that no payment or prepayment of any principal on any Eurodollar
Loan shall result in an interruption of any Interest Period. In the absence of
instructions to the contrary in any Borrowing Request and in the absence of the
delivery of any Continuation/Conversion Notice, the Borrower shall be deemed to
have requested that any affected Loan be made or converted to a Base Rate Loan.

              SECTION 2.3 Borrowing Request. By delivering to the Agent a
Borrowing Request at or before 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on a Business Day, the
Borrower may from time to time irrevocably request, on not less than two (2)
Business Days' notice, that a Borrowing be made in an amount equal to all or any
portion of the unused Commitment Amount (i.e., the Commitment Amount minus the
aggregate amount of all outstanding Loans).

              SECTION 2.4 Funding of Borrowing. On each Borrowing Date, each
Lender shall deposit with the Administrative Agent same day funds, at or before
10:00 a.m., Chicago time, in an amount equal to its Funding Percentage of the
requested Borrowing. Such deposit shall be made to such account as the
Administrative Agent shall specify. After timely receipt of such funds, the
Administrative Agent shall, at or before 1:00 p.m., Chicago time, on the
Borrowing Date, make such funds available to the Borrower by wire transfer in
same day funds to such accounts of the Borrower as the Borrower shall have
specified in writing. No Lender's obligation to make any portion of the Loans
shall be affected by any other Lender's failure to make any portion of the
Loans.

                                  ARTICLE III

                      RECORDKEEPING; NOTE; PAYMENTS; SETOFF

              SECTION 3.1 Evidence of Debt. The Loans made by each Lender shall
be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by
the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or
records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be
conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Loans made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall
evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each
Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

              SECTION 3.2 Payment of the Loans.

              3.2.1 Required Payments.

                                       16

<PAGE>

              (a) If at any time the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
       the Loans shall exceed the Commitment Amount in effect at such time, the
       Borrower shall make a principal repayment of the Loans in an amount equal
       to such excess.

              (b) The Borrower shall, immediately upon any acceleration of the
       maturity date of the Loans pursuant to Section 11.2, repay the Loans.

              3.2.2 Voluntary Payments. The Borrower may, from time to time on
       any Business Day, make a voluntary payment, in whole or in part, of the
       outstanding principal amount of any Loans, subject to Section 3.3.3.

              3.2.3 Conditions Applicable to all Payments.

              (a) Each payment of a portion of the Loans shall be made pro rata
       among Loans of the same Type and, if applicable, having the same Interest
       Period of all Lenders.

              (b) No payment of any Eurodollar Loan may be made on any day other
       than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan.

              (c) All voluntary payments shall require at least three but no
       more than five Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative
       Agent.

              (d) All voluntary partial payments shall be in an aggregate
       minimum amount of $1,000,000 and an integral multiple of $100,000.

              (e) All payments of principal of the Loans (in whole or in part)
       shall be accompanied by the payment of interest accrued on the principal
       amount being prepaid.

              SECTION 3.3 Making of Payments. All payments of principal of, or
interest on, the Note and of all fees and other Obligations to be made by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement shall be made by the Borrower without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff to
the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account or for the
benefit of the Lenders, as applicable, in immediately available Dollars. All
such payments shall be deposited to the Borrower's Account No. 74-50915 at Bank
of America (or such other account as the Administrative Agent may from time to
time specify), not later than 10:00 am., Chicago time, on the date due. The
Administrative Agent shall have the authority to debit such account for the
amount of any payments due in order to effect each such payment. Funds received
after 11:30 a.m., Chicago time, shall be deemed to have been received by the
Administrative Agent on the next following Business Day (unless such failure to
receive funds in a timely fashion is due to the Administrative Agent's failure
to debit the Borrower's account).

              SECTION 3.4 Due Date Extension. If any payment of principal or
interest with respect to the Loans falls due on a day which is not a Business
Day, then such due date shall be extended to the next following Business Day,
and additional interest shall accrue and be payable for the period of such
extension.

              SECTION 3.5 Set-off. The Borrower agrees that each of the Lenders,
the Administrative Agent and any Participant shall have all rights of set-off
provided by applicable

                                       17

<PAGE>

law, and in addition thereto, the Borrower agrees that at any time (a) any
payment or amount owing by the Borrower under or in connection with this
Agreement or the Loan Documents is then due or (b) any Unmatured Event of
Default pursuant to Section 10.1.5 or Event of Default exists, each Lender, the
Administrative Agent or any Participant may apply to the payment of such payment
or other amount any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of
the Borrower then or thereafter with such Lender, the Administrative Agent or
any Participant; provided, that, any proceeds or recoveries obtained by any such
Lender, the Administrative Agent or any Participant from any such appropriation
and application in excess of such entity's pro rata share of such payments or
amounts shall be shared with the other Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the
participants on a pro rata basis; provided, further however, no such set-off
shall be undertaken by any Lender or Participant domiciled in or with respect to
property located in California without the written consent of the Administrative
Agent.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                     INTEREST; CONVERSION; EURODOLLAR LOANS

              SECTION 4.1 Interest Rates. The Borrower shall pay interest on the
unpaid principal amount of the Loans for the period commencing on the date of
each such Loan until such Loan is paid in full, at the rates per annum specified
below:

              (a) On the outstanding principal amount of the Loans maintained
       from time to time as Base Rate Loans, interest shall accrue at the Base
       Rate from time to time in effect; and

              (b) On the outstanding principal amount of each Loan maintained
       from time to time as a Eurodollar Loan, interest shall accrue at a rate
       per annum equal to the Offshore Rate from time to time in effect for the
       related Interest Period plus the Applicable Eurodollar Interest Rate
       Margin in effect from time to time; and

              (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) any amount past due shall
       bear interest at a rate per annum (the "Default Rate") equal to the Base
       Rate Loan from time to time in effect (but not less than the Base Rate as
       in effect at such occurrence date) plus 3.5% per annum, and (ii) upon the
       occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default, and after
       notice by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower of the Required
       Lenders' intent to apply the Default Rate of interest the outstanding
       principal amount of the Loans and any other monetary Obligations shall
       bear interest at the Default Rate.

              SECTION 4.2 Interest Payment Dates. Accrued interest on the Loans
shall be paid on each Payment Date, commencing with the first such date
following the Effective Date. After maturity, accrued interest on the Loans
shall be payable on demand.

              SECTION 4.3 Setting of Rates. Interest rates hereunder shall be
calculated from time to time by the Administrative Agent and each such
calculation of an interest rate shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower
in the absence of manifest error. Any change in the Applicable Eurodollar Rate
Margin resulting from a change in the Borrower's public ratings shall be
effective on the date such public rating change is announced.

                                       18

<PAGE>

              SECTION 4.4 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on Base
Rate Loans, when based on the "prime rate," shall be computed on the basis of
actual days elapsed and a year consisting of 365 or 366 days, as applicable. All
other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed
and a year consisting of 360 days.

              SECTION 4.5 Continuation and Conversion Elections. At the election
of the Borrower pursuant to a Continuation/ Conversion Notice delivered to the
Administrative Agent at or before 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, the Borrower may
elect, from time to time on not less than three (3) Business Days' notice:

              (a) that all, or any portion, in an aggregate minimum amount of
       $1,000,000 and an integral multiple of $100,000, of the Loans be
       converted from Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans; and

              (b) on the expiration of the Interest Period applicable to any
       Eurodollar Loans, that all, or any portion, in an aggregate minimum
       amount of $1,000,000 and an integral multiple of $100,000, of such Loans
       be continued as Eurodollar Loans or converted into Base Rate Loans;

provided, however, that:

                     (i)  no portion of the outstanding principal amount of any
              Loan may be continued as, or be converted into, a Eurodollar Loan
              when any Default has occurred and is continuing; and

                     (ii) no portion of the outstanding principal amount of any
              Loan may be made or continued as, or be converted into, a
              Eurodollar Loan if, after giving effect to such action, the
              Interest Period applicable thereto shall extend beyond the date of
              any mandatory payment of such Loan unless a sufficient principal
              amount of the Loans is being maintained as Base Rate Loans or as
              Eurodollar Loans having Interest Periods ending on or prior to the
              date of any such mandatory prepayment to permit such repayment to
              be applied in full to Base Rate Loans.

              SECTION 4.6 Funding. In the event the Borrower elects to obtain
any portion of the Loans as Eurodollar Loans, or elects to convert any portion
of the principal amount of any Base Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Loan, each
Lender may, if it so elects, fulfill its obligation to make or continue any
portion of the principal amount of the Loans as, or to convert any portion of
the principal amount of any Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan in accordance with any
election made by the Borrower by causing a foreign branch or Affiliate of such
Lender or an international banking facility created by such Lender to make such
Eurodollar Loan; provided, however, that in such event such Eurodollar Loan
shall be deemed to have been made by such Lender for the purpose of all
provisions of this Agreement, and the obligation of the Borrower to repay such
Eurodollar Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender and shall be deemed to be
held by it, to the extent of such Eurodollar Loan, for the account of such
foreign branch, Affiliate or international banking facility.

                                       19

<PAGE>

              SECTION 4.7 Eurodollar Rate Lending Unlawful. If as the result of
any Regulatory Change, any Lender shall determine (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower) that it is unlawful for such Lender to
make, continue, or maintain any Loan as, or to convert any Loan into, a
Eurodollar Loan, the obligations of all Lenders to make, continue or maintain
any portion of the principal amount of any Loan as, or to convert any Loan into,
a Eurodollar Loan shall be, upon such determination (and telephonic notice
thereof, confirmed in writing, to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower),
forthwith suspended until such Lender shall notify the Administrative Agent that
the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist, and all Eurodollar
Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that
each Lender shall take any reasonable actions available to it (including the
designation of its lending office) consistent with legal and regulatory
restrictions that will avoid the need for such suspension and will not, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to
the Lender.

              SECTION 4.8 Eurodollar Deposits Unavailable. If prior to the date
on which all or any portion of the principal amount of any Loan is to be made or
continued as, or be converted into, a Eurodollar Loan, the Administrative Agent
shall have determined (and telephonic notice thereof, confirmed in writing,
shall have been given to the Borrower and the Lenders) that:

              (a) Dollar deposits in the relevant amount and for the relevant
       Interest Period are not available to the Administrative Agent or any
       Lender in the interbank eurodollar market; or

              (b) by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar
       market in Dollars, adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the
       interest rate applicable hereunder to such Eurodollar Loan;

then, the obligations of all Lenders to make or continue any portion of the
principal amount of any Loan as, or to convert any portion of any Loan into,
Eurodollar Loans shall forthwith be suspended until the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such
suspension no longer exist; provided, however, that each Lender shall take any
reasonable actions available to it (including the designation of its lending
office) consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions that will avoid the
need for such suspension and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Lender.

                                   ARTICLE V

                                      FEES

              SECTION 5.1 Payment of Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay the fees
set forth in this Article V. Where such fees are paid to the Administrative
Agent for the benefit of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall, upon
receipt of any such fees, promptly transmit to each Lender such Lender's ratable
portion of such fees.

              SECTION 5.2 Non-Use Fee. The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Lenders a fee for the period
commencing on the Effective

                                       20

<PAGE>

Date and ending on the Commitment Termination Date, equal to the Applicable
Non-Use Fee Rate in effect from time to time in each case applied to the daily
average unused portion of the Commitment Amount from time to time. Accrued
non-use fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each Fiscal Quarter
of Borrower and on the Commitment Termination Date.

       SECTION 5.3 Compensation of Administrative Agent. The Borrower shall pay
to the Administrative Agent such fees and other amounts as each shall agree to
in writing with the Borrower from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                  INCREASED COSTS AND OTHER SPECIAL PROVISIONS

       SECTION 6.1 Increased Costs. If, after the date hereof, any Regulatory
Change, or compliance by the Administrative Agent or any Lender with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any Governmental
Authority, shall subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to any Included
Tax or capital adequacy requirement with respect to, or shall otherwise increase
the effective cost of the Loans or such Lender's obligation to make, issue or
maintain the Loans (except for taxes, duties or similar charges including any
interest or penalties thereon which do not constitute Included Taxes), or shall
impose on a Lender any other condition, except with respect to taxes, duties or
similar charges including any interest or penalties thereon which do not
constitute Included Taxes, affecting the Loan, or such Lender's obligation to
make the Loans and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
any Lender of making, issuing or maintaining the Loans, or to reduce the amount
of, or any rate of return on, any sum received or receivable by such Lender
under this Agreement or under the Note with respect thereto, then upon written
notice of such occurrence to the Borrower by such Lender (which notice shall
contain a statement setting forth a description of such occurrence and shall be
signed by an authorized officer of such Lender), the Borrower shall pay directly
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
for such increased cost or such reduction; provided, however, that each Lender
shall take any reasonable actions available to it (including the designation of
a different lending office) consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions
that will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and
will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

       SECTION 6.2 Payment for Credits. If the Borrower is required pursuant to
Section 6.1 to pay and pays a Lender for any increased costs or any reduction of
any rate of return, and if such Lender, in good faith, determines that it has
received or been granted a credit against or relief or remission for or
repayment of any tax paid or payable by it, it shall, to the extent that it
could do so without prejudice to the retention of the amount of such credit,
relief, remission or repayment, pay to the Borrower such amount as such Lender
shall, in good faith, have determined to be attributable to such payment by the
Borrower.

       SECTION 6.3 Certificate Requirements. Each Lender that is not an entity
organized under the laws of the United States shall deliver to the Borrower
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) an accurate and complete original
signed copy of an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI properly
claiming complete exemption from withholding,

                                       21

<PAGE>

within thirty days of the signing of this Agreement, and shall promptly deliver
such additional or supplemental forms thereafter as may be required in order to
maintain the effectiveness and accuracy of such forms. In addition, each Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documentation as the Borrower
may reasonably request in order to comply with the United States tax laws.

       SECTION 6.4 General Funding Losses. The Borrower hereby agrees that upon
demand by the Administrative Agent (which demand shall be accompanied by a
statement signed by an authorized officer of the Administrative Agent setting
forth the basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed) the Borrower
will indemnify such Lender against any loss or expense which each Lender may
sustain or incur as reasonably determined by such Lender in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 6.4, as a result of any failure of the Borrower to
borrow, continue, convert or repay any Loan on a date specified therefor in a
notice (whether written or oral) of borrowing continuation, conversion or
repayment pursuant to this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 6.4 such
loss or expense for each Lender shall include an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (a) its cost of obtaining in the interbank eurodollar market the funds
for the Loans being repaid or not borrowed for the period from the date of such
prepayment or failure to borrow to the last day of the then current Interest
Period for such Loans (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the Interest
Period for such Loans that would have commenced on the date of such failure)
over (b) the amount of interest that such Lender would have earned had it
invested the entire amount of funds so prepaid or the entire amount of funds
acquired to effect, fund or maintain the Loans not borrowed, at the Federal
Funds Rate. For this purpose, all notices to a Lender or the Administrative
Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be irrevocable.

       SECTION 6.5 Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Lender shall be entitled
to fund and maintain its funding of all or its portion of the Loans in any
manner it sees fit; provided, however, that each Lender shall take any
reasonable actions available to it (including the designation of its lending
office) consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions that will avoid
increased cost to the Borrower and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such
Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Lender.

       SECTION 6.6 Conclusiveness of Statements: Survival of Provisions. In
making the determinations contemplated by this Article VI, the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders may make such reasonable estimates, assumptions,
allocations and the like that the Administrative Agent or the Lenders in good
faith determine to be appropriate. Upon making any determination pursuant to
this Article VI, the Administrative Agent shall provide the Borrower with a
certificate signed by an authorized officer of the Administrative Agent setting
forth any estimates, assumptions, allocations or other similar calculations made
by the Administrative Agent in connection with such determination. Subject to
the foregoing, determinations and statements of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders pursuant to this Article VI and any certificates delivered in connection
therewith shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The provisions of this
Article VI shall survive termination of this Agreement.

                                       22

                                  ARTICLE VII

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

       To induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make Loans
hereunder, the Borrower represents and warrants to each Lender that:


       SECTION 7.1 Due Organization, Authorization, etc. Each of the Borrower
and each Subsidiary (a) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation, (b) is duly
qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction where,
because of the nature of its activities or properties, such qualification is
required, which jurisdictions are set forth with respect to the Borrower and
each Subsidiary on Schedule 7.1, (c) has the requisite corporate power and
authority and the right to own and operate its properties, to lease the property
it operates under lease, and to conduct its business as now and proposed to be
conducted, and (d) has obtained all material licenses, permits, consents or
approvals from or by, and has made all filings with, and given all notices to,
all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction, to the extent required for
such ownership, operation and conduct (including, without limitation, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) as to each of
the foregoing except where the failure to do so would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Borrower, or on the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action (including, without limitation, shareholder approval,
if required). Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has received all
material governmental and other consents and approvals (if any shall be
required) necessary for such execution, delivery and performance, and such
execution, delivery and performance do not and will not contravene or conflict
with, or create a Lien or right of termination or acceleration under, any
Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation binding upon the Borrower or such
Subsidiaries. This Agreement and each of the Loan Documents is (or when executed

but failure to do so shall not impair the effect of such declaration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the effect as an Event of Default of any event
described in Section 10.1.1 may not be waived except by consent of all of the
Lenders in writing.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

              SECTION 11.1 Appointment and Authorization of Administrative
Agent. Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of
this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and
perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the Administrative
Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set
forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Administrative Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence,
the use of the term "agent" herein and in the other Loan Documents with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom,
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

              SECTION 11.2 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may
execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any other Loan Document by or
through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice
of counsel and other consultants or experts concerning all matters pertaining to
such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact that it selects in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                                       38

              SECTION 11.3 Liability of Administrative Agent. No Agent-Related
Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of
them under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
the transactions contemplated hereby (except for its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct in connection with its duties expressly set forth herein), or
(b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender or participant for any recital,
statement, representation or warranty made by any Loan Party or any officer
thereof, contained herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate,
report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received
by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure
of any Loan Party or any other party to any Loan Document to perform its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any
obligation to any Lender or participant to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof.

              SECTION 11.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent.

              (a) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
       be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, communication,
       signature, resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate,
       affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
       electronic mail message, statement or other document or conversation
       believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or
       made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of
       legal counsel (including counsel to any Loan Party), independent
       accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The
       Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to
       take any action under any Loan Document unless it shall first receive
       such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems
       appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its
       satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense
       which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any
       such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
       protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement
       or any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the
       Required Lenders (or such greater number of Lenders as may be expressly
       required hereby in any instance) and such request and any action taken or
       failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lender.

              (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
       specified in Section 9.11, each Lender that has signed this Agreement
       shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be
       satisfied with, each document or other matter required thereunder to be
       consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender
       unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from such
       Lender prior to the proposed the date of Closing specifying its objection
       thereto.

              SECTION 11.5 Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall not
be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default, except
with respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required
to be paid to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received

                                       39

<PAGE>

written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."
The Administrative Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such
notice. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such
Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article X;
provided, however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received
any such direction, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to)
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

              SECTION 11.6 Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by
Administrative Agent. Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has
made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Administrative
Agent hereafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment
or review of the affairs of any Loan Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person
to any Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have
disclosed material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to
the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon
any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make
such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-Related
Person.

              SECTION 11.7 Indemnification of Administrative Agent. Whether or
not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Lenders shall
indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not reimbursed by
or on behalf of any Loan Party and without limiting the obligation of any Loan
Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by it; provided, however,
that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of
any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities to the extent determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from such Agent-Related Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct;
provided, however, that no action taken in accordance with the directions of the
Required Lenders shall be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful
misconduct for purposes of this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing,
each Lender shall reimburse the Administrative Agent upon demand for its ratable
share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred
by the

                                       40

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery,
administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or
any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the
Administrative Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive termination of the
combined Commitments, the payment of all other Obligations and the resignation
of the Administrative Agent.

       SECTION 11.8  Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. Bank of
America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of credit for the
account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and generally
engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting or other
business with each of the Loan Parties and their respective Affiliates as though
Bank of America were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without notice
to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates may receive information regarding
any Loan Party or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of such Loan Party or such Affiliate) and
acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no obligation to
provide such information to them. With respect to its Loans, Bank of America
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender
and may exercise such rights and powers as though it were not the Administrative
Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders" include Bank of America in its
individual capacity.

       SECTION 11.9  Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
may resign as Administrative Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the
Administrative Agent resigns under this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall
appoint from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders,
which successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at
all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent
of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation
of the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may appoint, after
consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor administrative agent
from among the Lenders. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor
administrative agent hereunder, the Person acting as such successor
administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent and the term "Administrative Agent shall mean such
successor administrative agent and the retiring Administrative Agent's
appointment, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder as
Administrative Agent, the provisions of this Article XI and Sections 13.4 and
13.5 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken
by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement. If no successor
administrative agent has accepted appointment as Administrative Agent by the
date which is 30 days following a retiring Administrative Agent's notice of
resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall nevertheless
thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the duties of
the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

       SECTION 11.10 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement,

                                       41

<PAGE>

adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to any Loan Party,
the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan
shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise
and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand
on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise

              (a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the
       principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all
       other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other
       documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of
       the Lenders and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the
       reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
       Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and
       counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the Administrative
       Agent under Article V and Section 13.4 allowed in such judicial
       proceeding; and

              (b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
       deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Article V and Section 13.4.

       Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any
plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                         ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS

       SECTION 12.1  Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender and no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an
Eligible Assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.2, (ii) by way
of participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.4, or (iii) by
way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions
of Section 12.6 (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied,
shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto,
their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the
extent provided in

                                       42

<PAGE>

subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby,
the Indemnitees) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement.

       SECTION 12.2  Assignments. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or
more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at
the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of
the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans
at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund (as defined in subsection (g) of this
Section) with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which
for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such
assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if "Trade Date"
is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not
be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise
consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii)
each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part
of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement with
respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned; (iii) any assignment of a
Commitment must be approved by the Administrative Agent unless the Person that
is the proposed assignee is itself a Lender (whether or not the proposed
assignee would otherwise qualify as an Eligible Assignee); and (iv) the parties
to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an
Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing and recordation fee of
$3,500. Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the Eligible Assignee thereunder
shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 6.1, 6.4, 13.4 and 13.5 with respect
to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d) of this Section.

       SECTION 12.3  Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative
Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the

                                       43

<PAGE>

contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

       SECTION 12.4  Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the
consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell
participations to any Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any
of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a "Participant") in all or
a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it);
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or other modification
requiring consent of all Lenders that directly affects such Participant. Subject
to subsection (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant
shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 6.1 and 6.4 to the same extent as
if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to
subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.5 as though it were a
Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.5 as though
it were a Lender.

       SECTION 12.5  Greater Payment. A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 6.4 or 6.4 than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a
Lender not organized in the United States shall not be entitled to the benefits
of Section 6.1 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to
comply with Section 6.4 as though it were a Lender.

       SECTION 12.6  Pledge. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from
any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
such Lender as a party hereto.

       SECTION 12.7  Definitions. As used herein, the following terms have the
following meanings:

       "Eligible Assignee" means (a) a Lender; (b) an Affiliate of a Lender; (c)
   an Approved Fund; and (d) any other Person (other than a natural person)
   approved by (i) the Administrative Agent, and (ii) unless an Event of Default
   has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower (each such approval not to be
   unreasonably withheld or

                                       44

<PAGE>

       delayed); provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, "Eligible
       Assignee" shall not include the Borrower or any of the Borrower's
       Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

              "Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is (or
       will be) engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in
       commercial loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course
       of its business.

              "Approved Fund" means any Fund that is administered or managed by
       (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an
       Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                     GENERAL

              SECTION 13.1 Waiver; Amendments. No delay on the part of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or any holder of a Note or other Obligation
in the exercise of any right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise by any of them of any right, power or
remedy preclude other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. No amendment, modification or waiver of, or consent with
respect to, any provision of this Agreement or the Note or any Loan Document
shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed
and delivered by the Borrower and the Required Lenders and acknowledged by the
Administrative Agent and then any such amendment, modification, waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment,
modification, waiver or consent which would do any of the following shall be
effective unless in writing and signed by the Borrower and each of the Lenders
and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent: (a) extend the due date for, or
reduce the amount of, any payment or prepayment of principal of or interest on
any Loan (or reduce the principal amount of or rate of interest on any Loan) or
any fees; (b) change the definition of Required Lenders or subject any Lender to
any additional obligations including, without limitation, any increase in the
Commitment Amount; (c) waive any of the conditions precedent set forth in
Article IX (other than Sections 9.1.5, 9.1.6, 9.1.7, and 9.1.8), or (d) amend
this Section 13.1, Section 10.2 with regard to the waiver of an Event of Default
under Section 10.1.1 or 13.9. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provisions of
Article XI shall be amended, modified or waived without the written consent the
Administrative Agent.

              SECTION 13.2 Confirmations. The Borrower and the Administrative
Agent (or any holder of a Note) agree from time to time, upon written request
received by it from the other, to confirm to the other in writing the aggregate
unpaid principal amount of the Loan then outstanding under such Note.

              SECTION 13.3 Notices and Other Communications; Facsimile Copies.

              (a) General. Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all
       notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in
       in writing (including by facsimile transmission). All such written
       notices shall be mailed, faxed or delivered to the

                                       45

<PAGE>

       applicable address, facsimile number or (subject to subsection (c) below)
       electronic mail address, and all notices and other communications
       expressly permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to
       the applicable telephone number, as follows:

                     (i)  if to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, to the
              address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone
              number specified for such Person on Schedule 13.3 or to such other
              address, facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone
              number as shall be designated by such party in a notice to the
              other parties; and

                     (ii) if to any other Lender, to the address, facsimile
              number, electronic mail address or telephone number specified in
              its Administrative Questionnaire or to such other address,
              facsimile number, electronic mail address or telephone number as
              shall be designated by such party in a notice to the Borrower and
              the Administrative Agent.

All such notices and other communications shall be deemed to be given or made
upon the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt by the relevant party hereto and
(ii) (A) if delivered by hand or by courier, when signed for by or on behalf of
the relevant party hereto; (B) if delivered by mail, four Business Days after
deposit in the mails, postage prepaid; (C) if delivered by facsimile, when sent
and receipt has been confirmed by telephone; and (D) if delivered by electronic
mail (which form of delivery is subject to the provisions of subsection (c)
below), when delivered; provided, however, that notices and other communications
to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until
actually received by such Person. In no event shall a voicemail message be
effective as a notice, communication or confirmation hereunder.

              (b) Effectiveness of Facsimile Documents and Signatures. Loan
       Documents may be transmitted and/or signed by facsimile. The
       effectiveness of any such documents and signatures shall, subject to
       applicable Law, have the same force and effect as manually-signed
       originals and shall be binding on the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
       and the Lenders. The Administrative Agent may also require that any such
       documents and signatures be confirmed by a manually-signed original
       thereof; provided, however, that the failure to request or deliver the
       same shall not limit the effectiveness of any facsimile document or
       signature.

              (c) Limited Use of Electronic Mail. Electronic mail and Internet
       and intranet websites may be used only to distribute routine
       communications, such as financial statements and other information as
       provided in Section 8.1, and to distribute Loan Documents for execution
       by the parties thereto, and may not be used for any other purpose.

              (d) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The
       Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act
       upon any notices (including telephonic Borrowing Requests and
       Continuation/Conversion Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of the
       Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified
       herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other
       form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood
       by the recipient, varied

                                       46

       from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify each
       Agent-Related Person and each Lender from all losses, costs, expenses and
       liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice
       purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. All telephonic notices
       to and other communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded
       by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby
       consents to such recording.

              SECTION 13.4 Attorney Costs, Expenses and Taxes. The Borrower
agrees to pay or reimburse the Administrative Agent and each Lender for all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement, attempted
enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents (including all such costs and expenses incurred during
any "workout" or restructuring in respect of the Obligations and during any
legal proceeding, including any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency
laws), including all Attorney Costs. The foregoing costs and expenses shall
include all search, filing, recording, title insurance and appraisal charges and
fees and taxes related thereto, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and the cost of independent public accountants and other
outside experts retained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender. All amounts
due under this Section 13.4 shall be payable within ten Business Days after
demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall survive the termination of
the aggregate Commitments and repayment of all other Obligations.

              SECTION 13.5 Indemnification by the Borrower. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Agent-Related Person, each Lender and their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, claims, demands, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs)
of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any way relating to or arising out
of or in connection with (a) the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance
or administration of any Loan Document or any other agreement, letter or
instrument delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, (b) any Commitment or
Loan or the use or proposed use of the proceeds therefrom or (c) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory (including
any investigation of, preparation for, or defense of any pending or threatened
claim, investigation, litigation or proceeding) and regardless of whether any
Indemnitee is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified
Liabilities"); provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, demands, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and
nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee. No Indemnitee shall be liable for any damages
arising from the use by others of any information or other materials obtained
through IntraLinks or other similar information transmission systems in
connection with this Agreement, nor shall any Indemnitee have any liability for
any indirect or consequential damages relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or arising out of its activities in connection herewith or
therewith (whether before or after the Closing Date). All amounts due under this
Section 13.5 shall be payable within ten

                                       47

<PAGE>

Business Days after demand therefor. The agreements in this Section shall
survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any
Lender, the termination of the aggregate Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

              SECTION 13.6 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Loan, and shall continue in full force and effect
as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid or
unsatisfied.

              SECTION 13.7 GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND
THE NOTE SHALL BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER AND GOVERNED BY THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE
STATE OF ILLINOIS WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. WHENEVER
POSSIBLE EACH PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN SUCH MANNER AS
TO BE EFFECTIVE AND VALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, BUT IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE PROHIBITED BY OR INVALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SUCH PROVISION
SHALL BE INEFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH PROHIBITION OR INVALIDITY, WITHOUT
INVALIDATING THE REMAINDER OF SUCH PROVISION OR THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT. ALL OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER AND RIGHTS OF ANY LENDER EXPRESSED
HEREIN OR IN THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE IN ADDITION TO AND NOT IN LIMITATION OF
THOSE PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR IN ANY OTHER WRITTEN INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT
RELATING TO ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS.

              SECTION 13.8 JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY
RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY,
OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY
IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM ANY
RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS,
AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND
NOT BEFORE A JURY.

              SECTION 13.9 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be
binding upon Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their
respective successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective successors
and assigns; provided, however, that the Borrower shall have no right to assign
its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement. This Agreement and the
Loan Documents contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect
to the matters covered hereby.

                      FORM OF OPINION OF BORROWER'S COUNSEL

                                  May ___, 2002

To:  Bank of America, N.A., as
     Administrative Agent, and
     the Lenders referred to below
     231 South LaSalle Street
     Chicago, Illinois 60697

          Re:  Horace Mann Educators Corporation

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     I refer to that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of May ___, 2002 (the
"Credit Agreement"), between Horace Mann Educators Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the "Borrower"), various financial institutions which are, or may
become, parties thereto (the "Lenders") and Bank of America, N.A., as
Administrative Agent for the Lenders (the "Administrative Agent"). I am the
General Counsel of the Borrower and have represented the Borrower in connection
with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.

     This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 9.1.4 of the Credit
Agreement. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the
definitions assigned to such terms in the Credit Agreement, unless the context
otherwise requires.

     I have examined such matters of law and such certificates, documents and
records of public officials and of officers of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
as I have deemed necessary for purposes of this opinion, including, but not
limited to, the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. As to questions
of fact material to such opinions, I have relied on certificates of officers of
the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

     In rendering this opinion, I have made the following assumptions:

     (a)  All documents submitted to or reviewed by me are accurate and complete
          and if not originals are true and correct copies of the originals. The
          signatures on each of such documents by the parties thereto (other
          than the Borrower) are genuine. Each individual who signed such
          documents on behalf of any Person (other than the Borrower) had the
          legal capacity to do so. All individuals who signed such documents on
          behalf of a corporation (other than the Borrower) were duly authorized
          to do so.

<PAGE>

     (b)  The Lenders and the Administrative Agent have the corporate power and
          authority to execute and deliver the Credit Agreement and other Loan
          Documents to which they are parties and to perform their obligations
          under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

     (c)  The execution and delivery by the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
          of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which they are
          parties have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action
          and such documents have been duly executed and delivered by the
          Administrative Agent and the Lenders.

     Based upon the foregoing and subject to the limitations, qualifications and
exceptions set forth herein, I am of opinion that:

     1.   Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary (i) is a corporation duly
          organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
          state of incorporation, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and in
          good standing in each jurisdiction where, because of the nature of its
          activities or properties, such qualification is required, which
          jurisdictions are set forth with respect to the Borrower and each
          Subsidiary on Schedule 7.10 of the Credit Agreement , (iii) has the
          requisite corporate power and authority and the right to own and
          operate its properties, to lease the property it operate under lease,
          and to conduct its business as now and proposed to be conducted and
          (iv) has obtained all material licenses, permits, consents or
          approvals from or by, and has made all filings with, and given all
          notices to, all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction, to the
          extent required for such ownership, operation and conduct (including,
          without limitation, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
          by the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents) as to each of
          the foregoing except where the failure to do so would not have a
          Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as
          a whole.

     2.   The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of the Credit
          Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
          thereby are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized
          by all necessary corporate action (including, without limitation,
          shareholder approval, if required).

     3.   Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has received all material
          governmental and other consents and approvals (if any shall be
          required) necessary for such execution, delivery and performance, and
          such execution, delivery and performance do not and will not
          contravene or conflict with, or create a Lien or right of termination
          or acceleration under, any Requirement of Law or Contractual
          Obligation binding upon the Borrower or such Subsidiaries.

     4.   The Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
          party have been executed by the Borrower and constitute the legal,
          binding and enforceable obligations of Borrower enforceable against
          the Borrower in accordance with their respective terms.

<PAGE>

     5.   Other than Horace Mann Investors, Inc., neither the Borrower nor any
          of its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company
          "controlled by an investment company", within the meaning of the
          Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     6.   (a) Except as set forth in Schedule 7.4 of the Credit Agreement and
          (b) except for claims which are covered by Insurance Policies,
          coverage for which has not been denied in writing, or which relate to
          Ordinary Course Litigation, no claim, litigation (including, without
          limitation, derivative actions), arbitration, governmental
          investigation or proceeding or inquiry is pending or threatened
          against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) which would, if
          adversely determined, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Borrower
          or its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) which relates to any of
          the transactions contemplated hereby, and there is no basis known to
          the Borrower for any of the foregoing.

     The opinions expressed herein are limited (i) to the extent that general
equitable principles limit the availability of equitable remedies, including but
not limited to the remedy of specific performance, injunctive relief, the
appointment of a receiver, and rights of acceleration; and (ii) to the extent
that the enforceability of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents is
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, and other debtor relief laws of
general applicability.

     This opinion is based on my knowledge of the law and facts as of the date
hereof. I assume no duty to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any
facts or circumstances which may hereafter come to my attention or to reflect
any changes in any law which may hereafter occur or become effective.

                                   Respectfully submitted,



                                   ________________________________

                                     FORM OF
                       ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

     THIS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of
the date set forth in Item 1 (each reference to an "Item" herein shall be deemed
to refer to such Item on Schedule I hereto), is made by the party designated as
the Assignor on the signature pages hereto (the "Assignor") to the Person
designated as the Assignee on the signature pages hereto (the "Assignee").

                               W I T N E S E T H:

     The Assignor has entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of May ___, 2002
(as such agreement may be amended, supplemented, amended and restated or
otherwise modified from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), among Horace Mann
Educators Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), certain
financial institutions as are or may become parties thereto, including the
Assignor (collectively, the "Lenders"), and Bank of America, N.A., as
administrative agent (the "Administrative Agent") for the Lenders, under which
the Assignor has agreed to make Loans in the amounts of up to the amount set
forth in Item 2 (such amount equals the current Commitment of the Assignor and
may have been, or may be, reduced by Section 2.1.1 of the Credit Agreement and
by other assignments by or to the Assignor, and will be reduced by the
assignment under this Agreement) and the Lenders have agreed to make Loans in
the amounts of up to the current aggregate Commitment Amount set forth in Item
3. Such Loans are sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Advances" or each,
an "Advance". Unless otherwise defined, all terms used herein have the meanings
provided in the Credit Agreement.

     In consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants contained herein,
the Assignor and the Assignee hereby covenant and agree as follows:

     1.   Assignment and Assumption. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Assignor and the Assignee agree that:

          (a)  the Assignor hereby sells, transfers, assigns and delegates to
     the Assignee, in consideration of the Assignee's entering into this
     Agreement and the Assignee's payment to the Assignor of the amount set
     forth in Item 4; and

          (b)  the Assignee hereby purchases, assumes and undertakes from the
     Assignor, without recourse and without representation or warranty of any
     kind (except as expressly provided in this Agreement),

a share (equal to the Funding Percentage set forth in Item 5 expressed as a
percentage of the aggregate Commitment Amount of the Lenders) of the Assignor's
Commitment, Advances, rights, benefits, obligations, liabilities and indemnities
under and in connection with the Credit Agreement and all of the Advances,
including without limitation the right to receive payment of principal and
interest on such percentage of the Assignor's Advances, and the obligation to
fund

<PAGE>

all future Advances in respect of such assignment, and to indemnify the
Administrative Agent or any other party under the Credit Agreement and to pay
all other amounts payable by a Lender (in its respective percentage of the
aggregate obligations of the Lenders) under or in connection with the Credit
Agreement but not including any fees except as otherwise agreed by the Assignor
and the Assignee.

     The interest of the Assignor under the Credit Agreement (including the
portion of the Assignor's Advances and all such Commitments, Advances, rights,
benefits, obligations, liabilities and indemnities) which the Assignee purchases
and assumes hereunder is hereinafter referred to as its "Assigned Share". The
day upon which the Assignee shall make the payment described in the prior
paragraph is hereinafter referred to as the "Funding Date". Upon completion of
the assignment hereunder, the Assignor will have the revised share of the total
Commitment Amount as of the Lenders and Funding Percentage set forth in Item 6.

     2.   Future Payments. The Assignor shall notify the Administrative Agent to
make all payments with respect to the Assigned Share after the Funding Date
directly to the Assignee. The Assignor and Assignee agree and acknowledge that
all payments of interest, commitment fees and other fees accrued up to, but not
including, the Funding Date are the property of the Assignor, and not the
Assignee. The Assignee shall, upon payment of any interest, commitment fees or
other fees, remit to the Assignor all of such interest, commitment fees and
other fees accrued up to, but not including, the Funding Date.

     3.   No Warranty or Recourse. The sale, transfer, assignment and delegation
of the Assigned Share is made without warranty or recourse against the Assignor
of any kind, except that the Assignor warrants that it has not sold or otherwise
transferred any other interest in the Assigned Share to any other party. The
Assignor may, however, have sold and may hereafter sell participations in, or
may have assigned or may hereafter assign, portions of its interest in the
Advances and the Credit Agreement.

     4.   Covenants and Warranties. To induce each other to enter into this
Agreement, each of the Assignee and the Assignor warrants and covenants with
respect to itself that:

          (a)  Existence and Organization. It is, in each case, the type of
     institution, and duly organized under the laws of the jurisdiction, set
     forth in Item 7.

          (b)  Authority and Authorization. It is duly authorized to execute,
     deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and all acts and
     conditions required to be done and performed and to have occurred prior to
     the execution and delivery of, and performance of its obligations under,
     this Agreement have been done and performed and have occurred in compliance
     with all applicable laws.

          (c)  No Conflict. The execution and delivery of, and performance of
     its obligations under, this Agreement do not conflict with any provision of
     law or of the charter or by-laws (or equivalent constituent documents) of
     such party, or of any agreement binding upon it; and

<PAGE>

          (d)  Valid and Binding. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid
     and binding obligation of such party enforceable against such party in
     accordance with its terms.

     5.   Covenants and Warranties by the Assignee. To induce the Assignor to
enter into this Agreement, the Assignee warrants and covenants that (a) it is
purchasing and assuming the Assigned Share in the course of making loans in the
ordinary course of its business, and (b) it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Assignor, the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and
based upon such financial statements and other documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into
this Agreement. The Assignee acknowledges that the Assignor, the Administrative
Agent or any other Lender have not made and do not make any representations or
warranties or assume any responsibility with respect to the validity,
genuineness, enforceability or collectibility of the Advances, the Credit
Agreement or any related instrument, document or agreement. The Assignee
warrants and covenants that it is an Eligible Assignee.

     6.   Payments to the Assignor. All amounts payable to the Assignor in U.S.
Dollars shall be paid by transfer of federal funds to the Assignor as set forth
in Item 9.

     7.   Other Transactions. The Assignee shall have no interest in any
property in the Assignor's possession or control, or in any deposit held or
other indebtedness owing by the Assignor, which may be or become collateral for
or otherwise be available for payment of the Advances by reason of the general
description of secured obligations contained in any security agreement or other
agreement or instrument held by the Assignor or by reason of the right of
set-off, counterclaim or otherwise, except that if such interest is provided for
in provisions of the Credit Agreement regarding sharing of set-off, the Assignee
shall have the same rights as any other Lender that is a party to the Credit
Agreement. The Assignor and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to, act as trustee under indentures for and generally engage in any kind of
business with the Borrower, and any person who may do business with or own
securities of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Assignee shall have
no interest in any property taken as security for any other loan or any other
credits extended to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries by the Assignor.

     8.   Expenses. In the event of any action to enforce the provisions of this
Agreement against a party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover all costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith, including
without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses.

     9.   Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure the benefit of and
be binding upon the successors and assigns of the Assignor and the Assignee.

     10.  Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS.

     11.  Amendments, Changes and Modifications. This Agreement may not be
amended, changed, modified, altered, or terminated except by an agreement in
writing signed by the

<PAGE>

Assignor and the Assignee (or their permitted successors or assigns) and the
consent of the Borrower (which shall not be unreasonably withheld).

     12.  Withholding Taxes. The Assignee (a) represents and warrants to the
Assignor, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that under applicable law
and treaties no tax will be required to be withheld by the Assignor with respect
to any payments to be made to the Assignee hereunder, (b) agrees to furnish (if
it is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States
or any State thereof and if it is not otherwise prohibited or prevented by
applicable law or court order) to the Assignor, the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, either U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8 BEN or U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 ECI, and agrees
to provide (if not otherwise prohibited or prevented by applicable law or court
order) new Forms W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI upon (1) the expiration or obsolescence of
any previously delivered Form W-8 BEN or Form W-8 ECI or comparable statements
in accordance with applicable U.S. law and regulations and amendments thereto,
duly executed and completed by the Assignee, and (ii) in any event, in the case
of Form W-8 BEN, on each calendar year following the Funding Date, and, in the
case of Form W-8 ECI, at the end of each three-year period following the Funding
Date, and (c) agrees to comply with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations
with regard to such withholding tax exemption.

     13.  Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding
of the parties (except for any side letter between the Assignor and the Assignee
with reference to fees and other items) and supersedes any and all prior
agreements, arrangements, and understandings relating to the subject matter
hereof. No representation, promise, inducement or statement of intent has been
made by any party which is not embodied in this Agreement, and no party shall be
bound by or liable for any alleged representation, promise, inducement or
statement of intention not expressly set forth herein.

     14.  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement.

<PAGE>

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party hereto has caused this Agreement to be
executed on its behalf by its duly Authorized Officer as of the day and year
first above written.
