Managing Agent of any such notice being the <I>&#147;</I><B><I>Assignment Date</I></B><I>&#148;</I>). Each related Alternate Lender
hereby agrees, unconditionally and irrevocably and under all circumstances, without setoff,
counterclaim or defense of any kind, to pay the full amount of its Assignment Amount on such
Assignment Date to its related Conduit Lender or Conduit Lenders in immediately available funds to
an account designated by the related Managing Agent. Upon payment of its Assignment Amount, each
such Alternate Lender shall acquire an interest in such Facility Group&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Notes equal to
that transferred by the Conduit Lender. In the event that the aggregate of the Assignment Amounts
paid by any Facility Group&#146;s Alternate Lenders pursuant to this paragraph on any Assignment Date
occurring is less than the principal balance of the Class&nbsp;A Notes of the applicable Conduit Lender
on such Assignment Date, then to the extent payments are therefore received by the applicable
Managing Agent hereunder in respect of such Class&nbsp;A Notes in excess of the aggregate of the
unrecovered Assignment Amounts funded by the related Alternate Lenders, such excess shall be
remitted by the applicable Managing Agent to the applicable Conduit Lenders.
