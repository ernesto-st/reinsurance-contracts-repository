SUPPLIER AGREEMENT</P>
<P>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTRODUCTION</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Purchasing Opportunities for Members</U>. Novation, LLC ("Novation") is engaged in providing purchasing opportunities with respect to high quality products and services to participating health care providers ("Members"). Members are entitled to participate in Novation's programs through their membership or other participatory status in any of the following client organizations: VHA Inc., University HealthSystem Consortium, and HealthCare Purchasing Partners International, LLC (collectively, "Clients"). Novation is acting as the exclusive agent for each of the Clients and certain of each Client's subsidiaries and affiliates, respectively (and not collectively), with respect to this Agreement. A current listing of Members is maintained by Novation in the electronic database described in the Guidebook referred to in Subsection 7.c below ("Novation Database"). A provider will become a "Member" for purposes of this Agreement at the time Novation adds the provider to the Novation Database and will cease to be a "Member" for such purposes at the time Novation deletes the provider from the Novation Database.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Supplier</U>. Supplier is the manufacturer of products listed on Exhibit A, the provider of installation, training and maintenance services for such products, and the provider of any other services listed on Exhibit A (such products and/or services are collectively referred to herein as "Products").</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Bid</U>. Supplier has responded to Novation's Invitation to Bid by submitting its written offer ("Bid") to Novation consisting of this Agreement, the listing of Products and pricing therefor ("Award Prices") attached hereto as Exhibit A, the other specifications attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Non-Price Specification"), the Special Conditions attached hereto as Exhibit C ("Special Conditions"), and any other materials required to be submitted in accordance with the Bid Instructions.</P>
<P>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONTRACT AWARD</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Letter of Award</U>. By executing and delivering the Letter of Award attached hereto as Exhibit D ("Award Letter") to Supplier, Novation will have accepted the Bid, and Novation and Supplier therefore agree that Supplier will make the Products available for purchase by the Members at the Award Prices in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that Novation's award of this Agreement to Supplier will not constitute a commitment by any person to purchase any of the Products. No obligations of Novation set forth in this Agreement will be valid or enforceable against Novation unless and until the Award Letter has been duly executed by Novation and attached as an exhibit hereto. Supplier acknowledges that, in making its award to Supplier, Novation has materially relied on all representations, warranties and agreements made by Supplier as part of the Bid and that all such representations, warranties and agreements will survive acceptance of the Bid.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Optional Purchasing Arrangement</U>. Novation and Supplier agree that each Member will have the option of purchasing the Products under the terms of this Agreement or under the terms of any other purchasing or pricing arrangement that may exist between such Member and Supplier at any time during the Term; provided, however, that, regardless of the arrangement, Supplier will comply with Sections 7 and 9 below. If any Member uses any other purchasing or pricing arrangement with Supplier when ordering products covered by any contract between Supplier and Novation, Supplier will notify such Member of the pricing and other significant terms of the applicable Novation contract.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Market Competitive Terms</U>. Supplier agrees that the prices, quality, value and technology of all Products purchased under this Agreement will remain market competitive at all times during the Term. Supplier agrees to provide prompt written notice to Novation of all offers for the sale of the Products made by Supplier during the Term on terms that are more favorable to the offeree than the terms of this Agreement. Supplier will lower the Award Prices or increase any discount applicable to the purchase of the Products as necessary to assure market competitiveness. If at any time during the Term Novation receives information from any source suggesting that Supplier's prices, quality, value or technology are not market competitive, Novation may provide written notice of such information to Supplier, and Supplier will, within five (5) business days for Novation's private label Products and with ten (10) business days for all other Products, advise Novation in writing of and fully implement all adjustments necessary to assure market competitiveness.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Changes in Award Prices</U>. Unless otherwise expressly agreed in any exhibit to this Agreement, the Award Prices will not be increased and any discount will not be eliminated or reduced during the Term. In addition to any changes made to assure market competitiveness, Supplier may lower the Award Prices or increase any discount applicable to the purchase of the Products at any time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notification of Changes in Pricing Terms</U>. Supplier will provide not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice to Novation and not less than forty-five (45) days prior written notice to all Members of any change in pricing terms permitted or required by this Agreement. For purposes of the foregoing notification requirements, a change in pricing terms will mean any change that affects the delivered price to the Member, including, without limitation, changes in list prices, discounts or pricing tiers or schedules. Such prior written notice will be provided in such format and in such detail as may be required by Novation from time to time, and will include, at a minimum, sufficient information to determine line item pricing of the Products for all affected Members.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Underutilized Businesses</U>. Certain Members may be required by law, regulation and/or internal policy to do business with underutilized businesses such as Minority Business Enterprises (MBE), Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE), Small Business Enterprises (SBE), Historically Underutilized Businesses (HUB) and/or Women-owned Business Enterprises (WBE). To assist Novation in helping Members meet these requirements, Supplier will comply with all Novation policies and programs with respect to such businesses and will provide, on request, Novation or any Member with statistical or other information with respect to Supplier's utilization of such businesses as a vendor, distributor, contractor or subcontractor.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>E-Commerce Business</U>. Certain Members have chosen to utilize the services of the Marketplace@Novation&trade; through Novation's relationship with Neoforma.com, Inc. ("Neoforma"), to transact business associated with this Agreement with Supplier. To assist Novation in helping Members meet those needs, Supplier agrees to sign and comply with the Neoforma Master Supplier Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit F and support Novation's programs with respect to e-commerce.</P>
<P>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERM AND TERMINATION</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Term</U>. This Agreement will be effective as of the effective date set forth in the Award Letter ("Effective Date"), and, unless sooner terminated, will continue in full force and effect for the initial term set forth in the Non-Price Specifications and for any renewal terms set forth in the Non-Price Specifications by Novation's delivery of written notice of renewal to Supplier not less than ten (10) days prior to the end of the initial term or any renewal term, as applicable. The initial term, together with the renewal terms, if any, are collectively referred to herein as the "Term".</P>

In addition, Novation may terminate this Agreement immediately by delivering written notice thereof to Supplier upon the occurrence of either of the following events:</P>

Supplier agrees to give Novation prior written notice of any offer Supplier makes to any Member to sell products that are not covered by this Agreement in conjunction with Products covered by this Agreement under circumstances where the Member has no real economic choice other than to accept such bundled terms.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Discontinuation of Products; Changes in Packaging</U>. Supplier will have no unilateral right to discontinue any of the Products or to make any changes in packaging which render any of the Products substantially different in use, function or distribution. Supplier may request Novation in writing to agree to a proposed discontinuation of any Products or a proposed change in packaging for any Products at least ninety (90) days prior to the proposed implementation of the discontinuation or change. Under no circumstances will any Product discontinuation or packaging changes be permitted under this Agreement without Novation's agreement to the discontinuation or change. In the event Supplier implements such proposed discontinuation or change without Novation's agreement thereto in writing, in addition to any other rights and remedies Novation or the Members may have by reason of such discontinuation or change, (i) Novation will have the right to terminate any or all of the Product(s) subject to such discontinuation or change or to terminate this Agreement in its entirety immediately upon becoming aware of the discontinuation or change or any time thereafter by delivering written notice thereof to Supplier; (ii) the Members may purchase products equivalent to the discontinued or changed Products from other sources and Supplier will be liable to the Members for all reasonable costs in excess of the Award Prices plus any other damages which they may incur; and (iii) Supplier will be liable to Novation and the Clients for any loss of Marketing Fees resulting from such unacceptable discontinuation or change plus any other damages which they may incur.</P>

Supplier may request Novation in writing to agree to a replacement of any of the Products or the addition of a new product that is closely related by function or use to an existing Product at least sixty (60) days prior to the proposed implementation of the replacement or to the new product introduction. Under no circumstances will any Product replacement or new product addition to this Agreement be permitted without Novation's agreement to the replacement or new product.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Member Services</U>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Failure to Supply</U>. In the event of Supplier's failure to perform its supply obligations in accordance with the terms of this Section 4, the Member may purchase products equivalent to the Products from other sources and Supplier will be liable to the Member for all reasonable costs in excess of the Award Prices plus any other damages which they may incur. In such event, Supplier will also be liable to Novation and the Clients for any loss of Marketing Fees resulting from such failure plus any other damages which they may incur.

Supplier further represents and warrants that the Products will conform to the specifications, drawings, and samples furnished by Supplier or contained in the Non-Price Specifications and will be safe for their intended use. If any Products are defective and a claim is made by a Member on account of such defect, Supplier will, at the option of the Member, either replace the defective Products or credit the Member. Supplier will bear all costs of returning and replacing the defective Products, as well as all risk of loss or damage to the defective Products from and after the time they leave the physical possession of the Member. The warranties contained in this Subsection will survive any inspection, delivery, acceptance or payment by a Member. In addition, if there is at any time widespread failure of the Products, the Member may return all said Products for credit or replacement, at its option. This Subsection and the obligations contained herein will survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement. The remedies set forth in this Subsection are in addition to and not a limitation on any other rights or remedies that may be available against Supplier.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Product Compliance</U>.

Supplier will pay to Novation, as the authorized collection agent for each of the Clients and certain of each Client's subsidiaries and affiliates, respectively (and not collectively), marketing fees ("Marketing Fees") belonging to any of the Clients or certain of their subsidiaries or affiliates equal to the Agreed Percentage of the aggregate gross charges of all net sales of the Products to the Members directly or indirectly from Supplier, whether under the pricing and other terms of this Agreement or under the terms of any other purchasing or pricing arrangements that may exist between the Members and Supplier.
