or delayed (<U>provided</U> that no consent of Borrower shall be required if the successor Agent is also a Lender, is an Eligible Assignee or if an Event of Default then exists). If no successor Agent appointed by the Lenders shall have accepted
such appointment within sixty&nbsp;(60) days after delivery of notice of resignation or removal, then the departing Agent may, after consultation with the Lenders and Borrower, appoint a successor Agent with the consent of Borrower, which shall not

Borrower shall grant or deny its consent within ten&nbsp;(10) Business Days after request therefor (and if denying consent, shall specify in reasonable detail the basis of its denial) and Borrower shall be deemed to have consented if Borrower shall
fail to reply within such period. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as an Agent hereunder by a successor Agent and upon the recordation of a written designation and acceptance, Agent&#146;s resignation shall become effective and such successor
Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents other than its

in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as an administrative agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. The new Agent shall promptly deliver to Borrower a copy of the resignation and acceptance. If
no successor Agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the effective date of a retiring Agent&#146;s resignation or removal, the retiring Agent&#146;s resignation or removal shall nevertheless be effective and the Lender or Lenders, as applicable,
with the greatest Ratable Share (whether or not the Ratable Share of each such Lender is equal to or greater than the Agent Minimum Hold) shall perform all of the duties of Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Lender appoints a successor
Agent as provided for above; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if two&nbsp;(2) or more Lenders then hold the greatest Ratable Share of the Loan, such successor Agent shall be one of such Lenders as chosen by a vote of the requisite Lenders.
