JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Without Amending or limiting the arbitration agreement of each party under the Principals Agreement, each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware or if such court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding
shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;5.7</U>, however, shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law or at equity. </P>
