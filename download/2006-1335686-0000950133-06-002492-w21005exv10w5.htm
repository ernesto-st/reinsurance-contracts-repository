<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U>Present Assignment</U>. Assignor does hereby presently and unconditionally assign to
Agent, Assignor&#146;s right, title and interest in and to any and all Leases and Rents, it being
intended by Assignor that this Assignment constitute a present assignment and not an agreement to

substance satisfactory to Agent, as may hereinafter be requested by Agent to further evidence and
confirm said assignment. Such assignment to Agent shall not be construed to bind Agent to the
performance of any of the covenants, conditions, or provisions contained in any of the Leases or
otherwise to impose any obligation upon Agent. Agent is hereby granted and assigned by Assignor
the right to enter the Property for the purpose of enforcing its interest in the Leases and the
Rents, this Assignment constituting a present and unconditional assignment of the Leases and Rents.
Assignor shall authorize and direct, and does hereby authorize and direct, each and every present
and future tenant under the Leases to pay all Rents directly to Agent upon receipt of written
demand from Agent. It is the intent of Assignor and Agent hereunder that the Rents hereby
absolutely assigned are no longer, during the term of this Assignment, property of Assignor or

Paragraph&nbsp;1, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Assignor shall have the
right to act as lessor under the Leases to the extent not prohibited by the Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<U>License</U>. Although this Assignment constitutes a present assignment of all Rents,
so long as there shall exist no Event of Default under the Instrument or the Credit Agreement,
Assignor shall have a license (revocable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default) to collect and
receive the Rents as trustee for the benefit of Agent, and apply the Rents so collected to the
Secured Obligations, to the extent then due and payable, then to the payment of normal and
customary operating expenses for the Property which are then due and payable, with the balance, so
long as no Event of Default has occurred, to the account of Assignor. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default, the license granted in this Paragraph&nbsp;2 shall automatically, without further act
by Agent, cease and terminate, and thereafter, any Rents received by Assignor shall be held in
trust for the benefit of, and shall be immediately remitted by Assignor to, Agent.

Agreement shall have occurred and be continuing, Agent may collect and receive all the Rents,
including those past due as well as those accruing thereafter, and, Assignor hereby authorizes
Agent or Agent&#146;s agents to collect the Rents and hereby directs such tenants, lessees and licensees
of the Property to pay the Rents to Agent or Agent&#146;s agents. Assignor agrees that each and every
tenant, lessee and licensee of the Property may pay, and hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs
each and every tenant, lessee and licensee of the Property to pay, the Rents to Agent or Agent&#146;s
agents on Agent&#146;s written demand therefor (which demand may be made by Agent at any time after the
occurrence of an Event of Default) without any obligation on the part of said tenant, lessee or
licensee to inquire as to the existence of an Event of Default and notwithstanding any notice or
claim of Assignor to the contrary, and Assignor agrees that Assignor shall have no right or claim
against said tenant, lessee or licensee for or by reason of any Rents paid to Agent following
receipt of such written demand. Anything in this Paragraph&nbsp;3 to the contrary notwithstanding,
Agent shall not be obligated to discharge or perform the duties of a landlord or lessor to any
tenant or other occupant or incur any liability as a result of the exercise by Agent of its rights
under this Assignment, and Agent shall be liable to account only for the rents, income, issues,
profits and revenues actually received by Agent. In connection with any action taken by the Agent
pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;3, the Agent shall not be liable for any loss sustained by Assignor
resulting from any act or omission of the Agent, including a loss arising from the ordinary
negligence of the Agent, unless such loss is caused by its own gross negligence or willful
misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction after the expiration of all
applicable appeal periods, nor shall the Agent be obligated to perform or discharge any obligation,
duty or liability of Assignor. Assignor hereby assents to, ratifies and confirms any and all
actions of the Agent with respect to the Property taken under this Paragraph&nbsp;3.

of Assignor or the Agent for the account of Assignor received from or in connection with said
revenues or proceeds and apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of the Secured Obligations, when

prosecute and defend any and all actions or legal proceedings deemed advisable by the Agent in
order to collect such funds and to protect the interests of the Agent and/or Assignor, with all
costs, expenses and attorney&#146;s fees incurred in connection therewith being paid by Assignor.

reserved to Agent by this Assignment is intended to be exclusive of any other right, power or
remedy, but each and every such right, power and remedy shall be cumulative and concurrent and
shall be in addition to any other right, power and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute. No delay or omission of Agent or of any Banks to
exercise any right, power or remedy accruing upon any default shall exhaust or impair any such
right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default, or acquiescence
therein; and every right, power and remedy given by this Assignment to Agent may be exercised from
time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by Agent. No consent or waiver, expressed or
implied, by Agent to or of any breach or default by Assignor in the performance of the obligations
thereof hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any other breach
or default in the performance of the same or any other obligations of Assignor hereunder. Failure
on the part of Agent to complain of any act or failure to act or to declare an Event of Default
under the Instrument, the Credit Agreement, the Guaranty or the other Loan Documents, irrespective
of how long such failure continues, shall not constitute a waiver by Agent of its rights hereunder
or impair any rights, powers or remedies of Agent consequent on any breach or default by Assignor.
Nothing contained in this Assignment and no act done or omitted by Agent pursuant to the power and
rights granted to Agent hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver by Agent of its rights and
remedies under the other Loan Documents and this Assignment is made and accepted without prejudice
to any of the rights and remedies possessed by Agent under the terms thereof. The right of the
Agent to collect the Rents and to enforce any other security thereof held by it may be exercised by
Agent either prior to simultaneously with or subsequent to any action taken by it hereunder.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<U>Conflict with Credit Agreement Provisions</U>. Assignor hereby acknowledges and agrees
that, in the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of the Credit Agreement,
the terms of the Credit Agreement shall control.

constituting Agent a &#147;mortgagee in possession&#148; in the absence of the taking of actual possession of
the Property by Agent. In the exercise of the powers herein granted to Agent, no liability shall
be asserted or enforced against Agent, all such liability being expressly waived and released by
Assignor.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>No Oral Change</U>. This Assignment may not be modified, amended, waived, extended,
changed, discharged or terminated orally, or by any act or failure to act on the part of Assignor
or Agent, but only by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom the enforcement of
any modification, amendment, waiver, extension, change, discharge or termination is sought.

subject to Agent&#146;s option under Section&nbsp;1.03 hereof, on the days that monthly installments of
interest are payable under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum (hereinafter referred to
as the &#147;<U>Funds</U>&#148;) reasonably estimated by Agent to provide an amount necessary for payment of
the following items in full thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior to when such items become due (hereinafter
collectively referred to as the &#147;<U>Impositions</U>&#148;): (a)&nbsp;the yearly real estate taxes, ad

installments for the insurance covering the Property and required by the Credit Agreement. The
Impositions shall be reasonably estimated initially and from time to time by Agent on the basis of

permitted under this Section&nbsp;1.02, within ten (10)&nbsp;days after Grantor furnishes Agent with
reasonably satisfactory evidence that Grantor has paid one or more of the items comprising the
Impositions, Agent shall reimburse Grantor (or the one paying the Impositions) therefor to the
extent of the Funds (plus accrued interest) then held by Agent. Alternatively, Agent shall apply
the Funds to pay the Impositions with respect to which the Funds were paid to the extent of the
Funds then held by Agent and provided Grantor has delivered to Agent the assessments or bills
therefor. Grantor shall be permitted to pay any Imposition early in order to take advantage of any
available discounts. Agent shall make no charge for so holding and applying the Funds or for
verifying and compiling said assessments and bills. The Funds are pledged as additional security
for the Secured Obligations, and may be applied, at Agent&#146;s option and without notice to Grantor,
to the payment of the Secured Obligations upon the occurrence of any Event of Default. If at any
time the amount of the Funds held by Agent shall be less than the amount reasonably deemed
necessary by Agent to pay Impositions as such become due, Grantor shall pay to Agent any amount
necessary to make up the deficiency within fifteen (15)&nbsp;business days after notice from Agent to
Grantor requesting payment thereof. Upon payment and performance in full of the Secured

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference is made to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of May&nbsp;1, 2006 (as
the same may hereafter be amended, the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) by and among Republic Property Limited
Partnership (the &#147;Borrower&#148;), Republic Property Trust (&#147;RPB&#148;), KeyBank National Association for
itself and as Agent, and the other Lenders from time to time party thereto. Terms defined in the
Credit Agreement and not otherwise defined herein are used herein as defined in the Credit
Agreement.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, RPB is furnishing to you herewith (or have most recently

Such financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly the consolidated financial position of
Borrower and RPB, respectively, at the date thereof and the results of its operations for the
periods covered thereby.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certificate is submitted in compliance with requirements of &#167;2.10(d), &#167;5.4(b), &#167;7.4(c),
&#167;7.5(e), &#167;8.8(g), &#167;10.12 or &#167;11.3 of the Credit Agreement. If this certificate is provided under a
provision other than &#167;7.4(c), the calculations provided below are made using the consolidated
financial statements of Borrower and RPB, respectively, as of the Balance Sheet Date adjusted in
the best good faith estimate of Borrower to give effect to the making of a Loan, issuance of a
Letter of Credit, acquisition or disposition of property or other event that occasions the
preparation of this certificate; and the nature of such event and the estimate of Borrower of its
effects are set forth in reasonable detail in an attachment hereto. The undersigned officer is the
chief financial officer or chief accounting officer of RPB.

reviewed and have no knowledge of any Default or Event of Default. (Note: If the signer does have
knowledge of any Default or Event of Default, the form of certificate should be revised to specify
the Default or Event of Default, the nature thereof and the actions taken, being taken or proposed
to be taken by the Borrower with respect thereto.)
