     The Company will authorize the issue and sale of $100,000,000 aggregate

SECTION 2. SALE AND PURCHASE OF NOTES.

     Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company will
issue and sell to each Purchaser and each Purchaser will purchase from the
Company, at the Closing provided for in Section 3, Notes in the principal amount
specified opposite such Purchaser's name in Schedule A at the purchase price of
100% of the principal amount thereof. The Purchasers' obligations hereunder are
several and not joint obligations and no Purchaser shall have any liability to
any Person for the performance or non-performance of any obligation by any other
Purchaser hereunder.

occur at the offices of Chapman and Cutler LLP, 111 West Monroe Street, Chicago,

September 30, 2005 or on such other Business Day thereafter on or prior to
October 3, 2005 as may be agreed upon by the Company and the Purchasers. At the

Phoenix, Arizona 85004, ABA Number 021000021. If at the Closing the Company
shall fail to tender such Notes to any Purchaser as provided above in this
Section 3, or any of the conditions specified in Section 4 shall not have been
fulfilled to such Purchaser's satisfaction, such Purchaser shall, at its
election, be relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement, without
thereby waiving any rights such Purchaser may have by reason of such failure or
such nonfulfillment.

Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Neither any Obligor nor any
Subsidiary shall have entered into any transaction since the date of the

recourse to provisions (such as section 1405(a)(8) of the New York Insurance

as to the character of the particular investment, (b) not violate any applicable
law or regulation (including, without limitation, Regulation T, U or X of the

If requested by such Purchaser, such Purchaser shall have received an Officer's
Certificate certifying as to such matters of fact as such Purchaser may
reasonably specify to enable such Purchaser to determine whether such purchase
is so permitted.

     SECTION 4.6. SALE OF OTHER NOTES. Contemporaneously with the Closing the
Company shall sell to each other Purchaser and each other Purchaser shall
purchase the Notes to be purchased by it at the Closing as specified in Schedule
A.

rendered to the Company at least one Business Day prior to the Closing.

purports to own or hold under lease, to transact the business it transacts and
proposes to transact, to execute and deliver the Financing Agreements to which
it is a party, and to perform the provisions thereof.

     SECTION 5.2. AUTHORIZATION, ETC. The Financing Agreements have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate, limited liability company or partnership
action on the part of each Obligor party thereto, and this Agreement and the
Guarantee Agreement constitute, and upon execution and delivery thereof each
Note and other Financing Agreement will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each Obligor party hereto and/or thereto, as the case may be,
enforceable against such Obligor in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

     SECTION 5.3. DISCLOSURE. The Company, through its agent, J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc., has delivered to each Purchaser a copy of a Private Placement
Memorandum, dated September, 2005 (the "MEMORANDUM"), relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement, the Memorandum and the
financial statements delivered to the Purchasers by or on behalf of the Obligors
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and identified in
Schedule 5.5 (this Agreement, the Memorandum and such financial statements
delivered to each Purchaser prior to September 20, 2005 being referred to,
collectively, as the "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENTS") fairly describe, in all material
respects, the general nature of the business and principal properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Disclosure Documents, taken
as a whole, do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading
in light of the circumstances under which they were made. Except as disclosed in
the Disclosure Documents, since December 31, 2004, there has been no change in
the financial condition, operations, business, properties or prospects of any
Obligor or any Subsidiary except changes that individually or in the aggregate
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There is no
fact known to any Obligor that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect that has not been set forth herein or in the Disclosure
Documents.

     SECTION 5.4. ORGANIZATION AND OWNERSHIP OF SHARES OF SUBSIDIARIES;
AFFILIATES. (a) Schedule 5.4 contains (except as noted therein) complete and
correct lists (i) of the Company's Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary,
the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of its organization, and the
percentage of shares of each class of its capital stock or similar equity
interests outstanding owned by the Company and each other Subsidiary and whether
such Subsidiary will on the date of the Closing be a Guarantor and Obligor under
this

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Agreement and (ii) of the Company's directors and senior officers. There are no
Persons that are Affiliates of the Company which are not Subsidiaries.

     (b) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
interests of each Subsidiary shown in Schedule 5.4 as being owned by the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear of any Lien
(except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 5.4).

     (c) Each Subsidiary identified in Schedule 5.4 is a corporation or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation or other legal entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which such qualification is required by law, other than those jurisdictions
as to which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each such Subsidiary has the corporate or other power and
authority to own or hold under lease the properties it purports to own or hold
under lease and to transact the business it transacts and proposes to transact.

     (d) No Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any legal,
regulatory, contractual or other restriction (other than the Bank Credit
Agreement, the Financing Agreements, the agreements listed on Schedule 5.4 and
limitations imposed by corporate law or similar statutes or by applicable
regulatory or taxing authorities) restricting the ability of such Subsidiary to
pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that owns outstanding shares of
capital stock or similar equity interests of such Subsidiary.

     SECTION 5.5. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; MATERIAL LIABILITIES. The Company or
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as agent for the Company, has delivered to each
Purchaser copies of the financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
listed on Schedule 5.5. All of said financial statements (including in each case
the related schedules and notes) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates specified in such Schedule and the consolidated results of
their operations and cash flows for the respective periods so specified and have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the
periods involved except as set forth in the notes thereto (subject, in the case
of any interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments and absence
of footnotes). The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any Material
contingent obligations that are not disclosed on such financial statements or
otherwise disclosed in the Disclosure Documents.

     SECTION 5.6. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, OTHER INSTRUMENTS, ETC. The execution,
delivery and performance by each Obligor of the Financing Agreements to which it
is a party will not (i) contravene, result in any breach of, or constitute a
default under, or (except with respect to any Collateral created pursuant to the
terms of the Financing Agreements) result in the creation of any Lien in respect
of any property of such Obligor or any Subsidiary under, any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan, purchase or credit agreement, lease, corporate
charter or by-laws, or any other agreement or instrument to which such Obligor
or any Subsidiary is bound or by which such Obligor or any Subsidiary or any of
their respective properties may be bound or

affected, (ii) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any order, judgment, decree, or ruling of any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to such Obligor or any
Subsidiary or (iii) violate any provision of any statute or other rule or
regulation of any Governmental Authority applicable to such Obligor or any
Subsidiary.

     SECTION 5.7. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC. No consent, approval or
authorization of, or registration, filing or declaration with, any Governmental
Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
by any Obligor of the Financing Agreements to which it is a party other than
Form 8-K filings to be filed with the SEC within five Business Days after the
Closing (and the failure to make such filing would not affect the legality,
validity or enforceability of the Financing Agreements against the Obligors).

     SECTION 5.8. LITIGATION; OBSERVANCE OF AGREEMENTS, STATUTES AND ORDERS.
Except as set forth in Schedule 5.8:

     (a) there are no actions, suits, investigations or proceedings pending or,
to the knowledge of any Obligor, threatened against or affecting such Obligor or
any Subsidiary or any property of such Obligor or any Subsidiary in any court or
before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any Governmental Authority
that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; and

     (b) neither any Obligor nor any Subsidiary is in default under any term of
any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound, or
any order, judgment, decree or ruling of any court, arbitrator or Governmental
Authority or is in violation of any applicable law, ordinance, rule or
regulation (including without limitation Environmental Laws or the USA Patriot
Act) of any Governmental Authority, which default or violation, individually or
in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

     SECTION 5.9. TAXES. To the extent a failure to do so could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, each Obligor and its
Subsidiaries have filed all tax returns that are required to have been filed in
any jurisdiction, and have paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on such
returns and all other taxes and assessments levied upon them or their
properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent such taxes and
assessments have become due and payable and before they have become delinquent,
except for any taxes and assessments the amount, applicability or validity of
which is currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and
with respect to which such Obligor or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, has
established adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP. No Obligor knows of any
basis for any other tax or assessment that could reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. The Federal income tax liabilities of each Obligor
and its Subsidiaries have been finally determined (whether by reason of
completed audits or the statute of limitations having run) for all fiscal years
up to and including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001.

     SECTION 5.10. TITLE TO PROPERTY; LEASES. Each Obligor and its Subsidiaries
have good and sufficient title to their respective properties that individually
or in the aggregate are Material, including all such properties reflected in the
most recent audited balance sheet referred to in Section 5.5 or purported to
have been acquired by any Obligor or any Subsidiary after said date


                                       -7-

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

(except as sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), in
each case free and clear of Liens prohibited by the Financing Agreements. All
leases that individually or in the aggregate are Material are valid and
subsisting and are in full force and effect in all material respects.

     SECTION 5.11. LICENSES, PERMITS, ETC. (a) Each Obligor and its Subsidiaries
own or are licensed to use all patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks
and trade names, or rights thereto, that individually or in the aggregate are
Material and no Obligor or Subsidiary is infringing upon the intellectual
property rights of any other Person, except for such infringements that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in
a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) To the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of each Obligor,
there is no Material violation by any Person of any right of such Obligor or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any patent, copyright, proprietary software,
service mark, trademark, trade name or other right owned or used by such Obligor
or any of its Subsidiaries.

     SECTION 5.12. ERISA AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) Neither the Company nor any
ERISA Affiliate maintains, contributes to, or is obligated to maintain or
contribute to, or has, at any time within the past six years, maintained,
contributed to or been obligated to maintain or contribute to, any Plan or
Multiemployer Plan.

     (b) The expected postretirement benefit obligation (determined as of the
last day of the Company's most recently ended fiscal year in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, without regard to
liabilities attributable to continuation coverage mandated by section 4980B of
the Code) of the Obligors and their Subsidiaries is not Material.

     (c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Guarantee
Agreement and the issuance and sale of the Notes hereunder will not involve any
transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA or in
connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to section
4975(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Code. The representation by the Obligors to each
Purchaser in the first sentence of this Section 5.12(e) is made in reliance upon
and subject to the accuracy of such Purchaser's representation in Section 6.2 as
to the sources of the funds used to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be
purchased by such Purchaser.

     SECTION 5.13. PRIVATE OFFERING BY THE OBLIGORS. Neither any Obligor nor
anyone acting on its behalf has offered the Notes or the Guarantee Agreement or
any similar securities for sale to, or solicited any offer to buy any of the
same from, or otherwise approached or negotiated in respect thereof with, any
person other than the Purchasers and not more than 30 other Institutional
Investors, each of which has been offered the Notes at a private sale for
investment. Neither any Obligor nor anyone acting on its behalf has taken, or
will take, any action that would subject the issuance or sale of the Notes and
the Guarantee Agreement to the registration requirements of Section 5 of the
Securities Act or to the registration requirements of any securities or blue sky
laws of any applicable jurisdiction.

     SECTION 5.14. USE OF PROCEEDS; MARGIN REGULATIONS. The Company will apply
the proceeds of the sale of the Notes to refinance and permanently retire
outstanding Indebtedness under the Loan Agreement dated as of July 1, 2005
entered into among the Company, the certain lenders party thereto and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and for general corporate purposes.
No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be used,
directly or indirectly, for the purpose of buying or carrying any margin stock
within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (12 CFR 221), or for the purpose of buying or carrying or trading
in any securities under such circumstances as to involve the Company in a
violation of Regulation X of said Board (12 CFR 224) or to involve any broker or
dealer in a violation of Regulation T of said Board (12 CFR 220). Margin stock
does not constitute more than 5.0% of the value of the consolidated assets of
any Obligor and its Subsidiaries and no Obligor has any present intention that
margin stock will constitute more than 5.0% of the value of such assets. As used
in this Section, the terms "MARGIN STOCK" and "PURPOSE OF BUYING OR CARRYING"
shall have the meanings assigned to them in said Regulation U.

     SECTION 5.15. EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS; FUTURE LIENS. (a) Except as described
therein, Schedule 5.15 sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding
Indebtedness of each Obligor and its Subsidiaries as of July 1, 2005 (including
a description of the obligors and obligees, principal amount outstanding and
collateral therefor, if any, and Guaranty thereof, if any), since which date
there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates, sinking funds,
installment payments or maturities of the Indebtedness of such Obligor or its
Subsidiaries. Neither any Obligor nor any Subsidiary is in default and no waiver
of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or interest
on any Indebtedness of such Obligor or such Subsidiary and no event or condition
exists with respect to any Indebtedness of any Obligor or any Subsidiary that
would permit (or that with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would permit)
one or more Persons to cause such Indebtedness to become due and payable before
its stated maturity or before its regularly scheduled dates of payment.

     (b) Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.15, neither any Obligor nor any
Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future (upon the
happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether now owned
or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 10.5.

     (c) Neither any Obligor nor any Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise
subject to any provision contained in, any instrument evidencing Indebtedness of
such Obligor or such Subsidiary, any agreement relating thereto or any other
agreement (including, but not limited to, its charter or other organizational
document) which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the
incurring of, Indebtedness of such Obligor, other than the Bank Credit Agreement
and the Financing Agreements.

     SECTION 5.16. FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL REGULATIONS, ETC. (a) Neither the sale
of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor the Guaranty by the Guarantors under
the Guarantee Agreement nor their use of the proceeds thereof will violate the
Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control
regulations of the United States Treasury

Department (31 CFR, Subtitle B, Chapter V, as amended) or any enabling
legislation or executive order relating thereto.

     (b) Neither any Obligor nor any Subsidiary (i) is a Person described or
designated in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the
Office of Foreign Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order or
(ii) to the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of any Obligor, engages
in any material dealings or transactions with any such Person. Each Obligor and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance, in all material respects, with the USA
Patriot Act.

     (c) No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder will be
used, directly or indirectly, for any payments to any governmental official or
employee, political party, official of a political party, candidate for
political office, or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to
obtain, retain or direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation
of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, assuming
in all cases that such Act applies to the Obligors.

     SECTION 5.17. STATUS UNDER CERTAIN STATUTES. Neither any Obligor nor any
Subsidiary is subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended, the ICC
Termination Act of 1995, as amended, or the Federal Power Act, as amended.

     SECTION 5.18. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. (a) Neither any Obligor nor any
Subsidiary has knowledge of any claim or has received any notice of any claim,
and no proceeding has been instituted raising any claim against such Obligor or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective real properties now or
formerly owned, or, to the actual knowledge of any Responsible Officer of any
Obligor, leased or operated by any of them or other assets, alleging any damage
to the environment or violation of any Environmental Laws, except, in each case,
such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

     (b) No Responsible Officer of any Obligor has actual knowledge of any facts
which would give rise to any claim, public or private, of violation of
Environmental Laws or damage to the environment emanating from, occurring on or
in any way related to real properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated
by such Obligor or any Subsidiary or to other assets or their use, except, in
each case, such as could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

     (c) Neither any Obligor nor any Subsidiary has, to the actual knowledge of
any Responsible Officer of any Obligor, stored any Hazardous Materials on real
properties now or formerly owned, leased or operated by any of them and has not
disposed of any Hazardous Materials in a manner contrary to any Environmental
Laws in each case in any manner that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect; and

     (d) All buildings on all real properties now owned, leased or operated by
each Obligor or any Subsidiary are (to the actual knowledge of any Responsible
Officer of any Obligor with respect to such leased or operated real properties)
in compliance with applicable Environmental

Laws, except where failure to comply could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 5.19. PARI PASSU RANKING. Except for Indebtedness specifically
identified as such on Schedule 5.15, the Company's obligations under the
Financing Agreements will, upon issuance of the Notes, rank at least pari passu,
without preference or priority, with all of its other outstanding unsubordinated
unsecured Indebtedness (including, without limitation, the Bank Credit Agreement
and the other Loan Documents). Except for Indebtedness specifically identified
as such on Schedule 5.15, each Obligor's (other than the Company) obligations
under the Financing Agreements will, upon issuance thereof, rank at least pari
passu, without preference or priority, with all of such Obligor's other
outstanding unsubordinated unsecured Indebtedness (including, without
limitation, the Bank Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents). Each Person
which is a borrower, guarantor or other obligor, in each case, under the Bank
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents is an Obligor under the Financing
Agreements. No Subsidiary or Affiliate has provided, directly or indirectly, any
security, collateral or other credit enhancement in respect of the Bank Credit
Agreement and the other Loan Documents which has not been provided to the
Purchasers.

SECTION 6. REPRESENTATIONS OF THE PURCHASERS.

     SECTION 6.1. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT. Each Purchaser severally represents
that it is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of subparagraph (a) of
Rule 501 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act. Each Purchaser severally
represents that it is purchasing the Notes for its own account or for one or
more separate accounts maintained by such Purchaser or for the account of one or
more pension or trust funds, each of which is also an "accredited investor", and
not with a view to the distribution thereof, provided that the disposition of
such Purchaser's or their property shall at all times be within such Purchaser's
or their control. Each Purchaser understands that the Notes and the Guarantee
Agreement have not been registered under the Securities Act and may be resold
only if registered pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Act or if an
exemption from registration is available, except under circumstances where
neither such registration nor such an exemption is required by law, and that the
Obligors are not required to register the Notes or the Guarantee Agreement.

     SECTION 6.2. SOURCE OF FUNDS. Each Purchaser severally represents that at
least one of the following statements is an accurate representation as to each
source of funds (a "SOURCE") to be used by such Purchaser to pay the purchase
price of the Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser hereunder:

          (a) the Source is an "insurance company general account" (as the term
     is defined in the United States Department of Labor's Prohibited
     Transaction Exemption ("PTE") 95-60) in respect of which the reserves and
     liabilities (as defined by the annual statement for life insurance
     companies approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
     (the "NAIC ANNUAL STATEMENT")) for the general account contract(s) held by

     set forth in the NAIC Annual Statement filed with such Purchaser's state of
     domicile; or

          (b) the Source is a separate account that is maintained solely in
     connection with such Purchaser's fixed contractual obligations under which
     the amounts payable, or credited, to any employee benefit plan (or its
     related trust) that has any interest in such separate account (or to any
     participant or beneficiary of such plan (including any annuitant)) are not
     affected in any manner by the investment performance of the separate
     account; or

          (c) the Source is either (i) an insurance company pooled separate
     account, within the meaning of PTE 90-1 or (ii) a bank collective
     investment fund, within the meaning of the PTE 91-38 and, except as
     disclosed by such Purchaser to the Company in writing pursuant to this
     clause (c), no employee benefit plan or group of plans maintained by the
     same employer or employee organization beneficially owns more than 10% of
     all assets allocated to such pooled separate account or collective
     investment fund; or

          (d) the Source constitutes assets of an "investment fund" (within the
     meaning of Part V of PTE 84-14 (the "QPAM EXEMPTION")) managed by a
     "qualified professional asset manager" or "QPAM" (within the meaning of
     Part V of the QPAM Exemption), no employee benefit plan's assets that are
     included in such investment fund, when combined with the assets of all
     other employee benefit plans established or maintained by the same employer
     or by an affiliate (within the meaning of Section V(c)(1) of the QPAM
     Exemption) of such employer or by the same employee organization and
     managed by such QPAM, exceed 20% of the total client assets managed by such
     QPAM, the conditions of Part I(c) and (g) of the QPAM Exemption are

     Exemption) owns a 5% or more interest in the Company and (i) the identity
     of such QPAM and (ii) the names of all employee benefit plans whose assets
     are included in such investment fund have been disclosed to the Company in
     writing pursuant to this clause (d); or

          (e) the Source constitutes assets of a "plan(s)" (within the meaning
     of Section IV of PTE 96-23 (the "INHAM EXEMPTION")) managed by an "in-house
     asset manager" or "INHAM" (within the meaning of Part IV of the INHAM
     exemption), the conditions of Part I(a), (g) and (h) of the INHAM Exemption

     account or trust fund comprised of one or more employee benefit plans, each
     of which has been identified to the Company in writing pursuant to this
     clause (g); or

          (h) the Source does not include assets of any employee benefit plan,
     other than a plan exempt from the coverage of ERISA.

As used in this Section 6.2, the terms "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN," "GOVERNMENTAL
PLAN," and "SEPARATE ACCOUNT" shall have the respective meanings assigned to
such terms in section 3 of ERISA.

SECTION 7. INFORMATION AS TO COMPANY.

     SECTION 7.1. FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS INFORMATION. The Obligors shall deliver
to each holder of Notes that is an Institutional Investor:

     consent will not be unreasonably withheld) its independent public
     accountants, and (with the consent of the Company, which consent will not
     be unreasonably withheld) to visit the other offices and properties of such
     Obligor and each Subsidiary, all at such reasonable times and as often as
     may be reasonably requested in writing; and

          (b) Default -- if a Default or Event of Default then exists, at the
     expense of the Obligors (which shall not exceed the reasonable expenses

     SECTION 7.4. LIMITATION ON DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION. No Obligor shall be

<PAGE>

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     of Section 20, such Obligor would be prohibited from disclosing by
     applicable privacy laws or regulations; or

          (b) information that, notwithstanding the confidentiality requirements
     of Section 20, such Obligor is prohibited from disclosing by the terms of
     an obligation of confidentiality contained in any agreement with any
     non-Affiliate binding upon such Obligor and not entered into in
     contemplation of this clause (b), provided that such Obligor shall use
     commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consent from the party in whose
     favor the obligation of confidentiality was made to permit the disclosure
     of the relevant information and provided further that such Obligor has
     received a written opinion of counsel confirming that disclosure of such
     information without consent from such other contractual party would
     constitute a breach of such agreement.

     Promptly after a request therefor from any holder of Notes that is an
     Institutional Investor, the Company will provide such holder with a written
     opinion of counsel (which may be addressed to the Company) relied upon as
     to any requested information that any Obligor is prohibited from disclosing
     to such holder under circumstances described in this Section 7.4.

SECTION 8. PAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.

     SECTION 8.1. MATURITY. As provided therein, the entire unpaid principal
balance of the Notes shall be due and payable on the stated maturity date
thereof.

     SECTION 8.2. OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. (a) The Company may, at its option, upon
notice as provided below, prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part
of, the Notes, in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of
the principal amount so prepaid, and the Make-Whole Amount determined for the
prepayment date with respect to such principal amount. The Company will give
each holder of Notes notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2
not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such
prepayment. Each such notice shall specify such date (which shall be a Business
Day), the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid on such date,
the principal amount of each Note held by such holder to be prepaid (determined
in accordance with Section 8.4), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment
date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and shall be
accompanied by a certificate of a Senior Financial Officer as to the estimated
Make-Whole Amount due in connection with such prepayment (calculated as if the
date of such notice were the date of the prepayment), setting forth the details
of such computation. Two Business Days prior to such prepayment, the Company
shall deliver to each holder of Notes a certificate of a Senior Financial
Officer specifying the calculation of such Make-Whole Amount as of the specified
prepayment date.

     (b) In the event of any Debt Prepayment Application pursuant to Section
10.6, the Company shall offer to prepay each outstanding Note in a principal
amount which equals the Ratable Portion for such Note (which offer shall be in
writing and shall offer to make such prepayment on a Business Day which is not
less than 30 and not more than 60 days after the date


                                      -17-

of the notice of offer (the "DISPOSITION PREPAYMENT DATE")), together with
accrued interest thereon to the date of such prepayment. Each holder of a Note
shall notify the Company of such holder's acceptance or rejection of such offer
within 10 Business Days of receipt thereof by giving notice of such acceptance
or rejection to the Company, provided, however, that any holder who fails to so
notify the Company within 10 Business Days of receipt of the notice of offer of
prepayment shall be deemed to have rejected such offer. If any holder rejects or
is deemed to have rejected such offer of prepayment in accordance with the
preceding sentence, then, for the purposes of determining compliance with
Section 10.6(c), the Company nevertheless will be deemed to have made a Debt
Prepayment Application in an amount equal to the Ratable Portion for such Note.
The Company shall prepay on the Disposition Prepayment Date the Ratable Portion
of each Note held by the holders who have accepted such offer in accordance with
this Section 8.2(b), together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such
prepayment. "RATABLE PORTION" for any Note means, with respect to a Debt
Prepayment Application, an amount equal to the product of (x) the Net Sales
Amount being so applied to the payment of Senior Debt multiplied by (y) a
fraction the numerator of which is the outstanding principal amount of such Note
and the denominator of which is the aggregate principal amount of Senior Debt of
the Obligors and their Subsidiaries that is being offered to be paid as part of
such Debt Prepayment Application. The Make-Whole Amount shall not be payable in
connection with any Debt Prepayment Application made with respect to the Notes
from the Net Sale Amount (or portion thereof) arising from Asset Dispositions.

     SECTION 8.3. PREPAYMENT OF NOTES UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL.

     (a) Notice of Change in Control. Within five Business Days of a Change in
Control, the Company shall have given to each holder of Notes written notice
containing and constituting an offer to prepay Notes as described in
subparagraph (b) of this Section 8.3, accompanied by the certificate described
in subparagraph (e) of this Section 8.3.

     (b) Offer to Prepay Notes. The offer to prepay Notes contemplated by
subparagraph (a) of this Section 8.3 shall be an offer to prepay, in accordance
with and subject to this Section 8.3, all, but not less than all, the Notes held
by each holder (in this case only, "HOLDER" in respect of any note registered in
the name of a nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such
beneficial owner) on the date specified in such offer (the "PROPOSED PREPAYMENT
DATE") that is not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days after the date of
such offer.

     (c) Acceptance; Rejection. A holder of Notes may accept the offer to prepay
made pursuant to this Section 8.3 by causing a notice of such acceptance to be
delivered to the Company at least 10 Business Days prior to the Proposed
Prepayment Date. A failure by a holder of Notes to respond to an offer to prepay
made pursuant to this Section 8.3 shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of
such offer by such holder.

     (d) Prepayment. Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to this
Section 8.3 shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together
with interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment and without any
Make-Whole Amount. The prepayment shall be made on the Proposed Prepayment Date.

<PAGE>

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     (e) Officer's Certificate. Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant to this
Section 8.3 shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a Senior
Financial Officer of the Company and dated the date of such offer, specifying:
(i) the Proposed Prepayment Date; (ii) that such offer is made pursuant to this
Section 8.3; (iii) the principal amount of each Note offered to be prepaid; (iv)
the interest that would be due on each Note offered to be prepaid, accrued to
the Proposed Prepayment Date; (v) that the conditions of this Section 8.3 have
been fulfilled; and (vi) in reasonable detail, the nature and date or proposed
date of the Change in Control.

     (f) Certain Definitions. "CHANGE IN CONTROL" means (a) the acquisition of
ownership, directly or indirectly, beneficial or of record, by any "person" or
"group" (within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules
of the SEC thereunder as in effect on the date of Closing), of Equity Interest
representing more than 35% of the aggregate ordinary voting power represented by
the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of the Company; (b) occupation of a
majority of the seats (other than vacant seats) on the board of directors of the
Company by Persons who were neither (i) nominated by the board of directors of
the Company nor (ii) appointed by directors so nominated; or (c) the acquisition
of direct or indirect Control of the Company by any Person or group.

     SECTION 8.4. ALLOCATION OF PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS. In the case of each partial
prepayment of the Notes pursuant to Section 8.2(a), the principal amount of the
Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time
outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid
principal amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.

     SECTION 8.5. MATURITY; SURRENDER, ETC. In the case of each prepayment of
Notes pursuant to this Section 8, the principal amount of each Note to be
prepaid shall mature and become due and payable on the date fixed for such
prepayment (which shall be a Business Day), together with interest on such
principal amount accrued to such date and, in the case of prepayments pursuant
to Section 8.2(a), the applicable Make-Whole Amount, if any. From and after such
date, unless the Company shall fail to pay such principal amount when so due and
payable, together with the interest and Make-Whole Amount, if any, as aforesaid,
interest on such principal amount shall cease to accrue. Any Note paid or
prepaid in full shall be surrendered to the Company and cancelled and shall not
be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount
of any Note.

     SECTION 8.6. PURCHASE OF NOTES. The Company will not and will not permit
any Affiliate to purchase, redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or
indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment or prepayment
of the Notes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Notes. The
Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant
to any payment or prepayment of Notes pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement and no Notes may be issued in substitution or exchange for any such
Notes.

     SECTION 8.7. MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT.

     "MAKE-WHOLE AMOUNT" means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with
respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called
Principal, provided that the

<PAGE>

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

Make-Whole Amount may in no event be less than zero. For the purposes of
determining the Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following
meanings:

     "CALLED PRINCIPAL" means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such
Note that is to be prepaid pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or has become or is
declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the
context requires.

     "DISCOUNTED VALUE" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note,
the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect
to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the
Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with
accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same
periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the
Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.

     "REINVESTMENT YIELD" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any
Note, .50% over the yield to maturity implied by (i) the yields reported as of
10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the
Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated
as "Page PX1" (or such other display as may replace Page PX1 on Bloomberg
Financial Markets ("Bloomberg") or, if Page PX1 (or its successor screen on
Bloomberg) is unavailable, the Telerate Access Service screen which corresponds
most closely to Page PX1 for the most recently issued actively traded U.S.
Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of
such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date, or (ii) if such yields are not
reported as of such time or the yields reported as of such time are not
ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), the Treasury Constant
Maturity Series Yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have
been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date
with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release
H.15 (519) (or any comparable successor publication) for actively traded U.S.
Treasury securities having a constant maturity equal to the Remaining Average
Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. Such implied yield
will be determined, if necessary, by (a) converting U.S. Treasury bill
quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial
practice and (b) interpolating linearly between (1) the actively traded U.S.
Treasury security with the maturity closest to and greater than such Remaining
Average Life and (2) the actively traded U.S. Treasury security with the
maturity closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment
Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the
interest rate of the applicable Note.

     "REMAINING AVERAGE LIFE" means, with respect to any Called Principal, the
number of years (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth year) obtained by
dividing (i) such Called Principal into (ii) the sum of the products obtained by
multiplying (a) the principal component of each Remaining Scheduled Payment with
respect to such Called Principal by (b) the number of years (calculated to the
nearest one-twelfth year) that will elapse between the Settlement Date with
respect to such Called Principal and the scheduled due date of such Remaining
Scheduled Payment.

     "REMAINING SCHEDULED PAYMENTS" means, with respect to the Called Principal
of any Note, all payments of such Called Principal and interest thereon that
would be due after the


                                      -20-

Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal if no payment of such
Called Principal were made prior to its scheduled due date, provided that if
such Settlement Date is not a date on which interest payments are due to be made
under the terms of the Notes, then the amount of the next succeeding scheduled
interest payment will be reduced by the amount of interest accrued to such
Settlement Date and required to be paid on such Settlement Date pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) or Section 12.1.

     "SETTLEMENT DATE" means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note,
the date on which such Called Principal is to be prepaid pursuant to Section
8.2(a) or has become or is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant
to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

SECTION 9. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

     The Obligors, jointly and severally, covenant that so long as any of the
Notes are outstanding:

     SECTION 9.1. COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Without limiting Section 10.4, each
Obligor will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all laws,
ordinances or governmental rules or regulations to which each of them is
subject, including, without limitation, ERISA, the USA Patriot Act and
Environmental Laws, and will obtain and maintain in effect all licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations
necessary to the ownership of their respective properties or to the conduct of
their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary to ensure that
non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules or regulations
or failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses, certificates,
permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations could not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 9.2. INSURANCE. Each Obligor will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers,
insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against
such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such
amounts as is customary in the case of entities engaged in the same or a similar
business and similarly situated.

     SECTION 9.3. MAINTENANCE OF PROPERTIES. Each Obligor will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and
kept, their respective properties in good repair, working order and condition
(other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times, provided that this
Section shall not prevent any Obligor or any Subsidiary from discontinuing the
operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such discontinuance is
desirable in the conduct of its business and such Obligor has concluded that
such discontinuance could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 9.4. PAYMENT OF TAXES AND CLAIMS. Each Obligor will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, file all tax returns required to be filed in any
jurisdiction and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on
such returns and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or levies

franchises, to the extent such taxes and assessments have become due and payable
and before they have become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become
due and payable that have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of such
Obligor or any Subsidiary, provided that neither such Obligor nor any Subsidiary
need pay any such tax or assessment or claims if (i) the amount, applicability
or validity thereof is contested by such Obligor or such Subsidiary on a timely
basis in good faith and in appropriate proceedings, and such Obligor or such
Subsidiary has established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP on
the books of the Company or such Subsidiary, or (ii) the nonpayment of all such
taxes, assessments and claims in the aggregate could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     SECTION 9.5. CORPORATE EXISTENCE, ETC. Each Obligor will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its corporate, limited
liability company or partnership existence and the rights, licenses, permits,
privileges and franchises Material to the conduct of its business; provided that
the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger, consolidation, liquidation,
dissolution or sale permitted under Sections 10.2 or 10.6.

     SECTION 9.6. BOOKS AND RECORDS. Each Obligor will, and will cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, maintain proper books of record and account in conformity
with GAAP in all material respects.

     SECTION 9.7. GUARANTORS. (a) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that,
as promptly as possible but in any event within thirty (30) days (or such later
date as may be agreed upon by the Required Holders) after any Person becomes a
Material Subsidiary or any Subsidiary qualifies independently as, or is
designated by the Company as, a Material Subsidiary pursuant to the definition
of "Material Subsidiary," the Company shall provide the holders with notice
thereof setting forth information in reasonable detail describing the material
assets of such Subsidiary and shall cause each such Subsidiary to enter into a
Joinder Agreement or otherwise deliver another Guarantee Agreement reasonably
acceptable to the Required Holders, in each case, for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes.

     In addition to the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, the Company
hereby covenants and agrees that, in any other event where any Subsidiary which
is not then a Guarantor guarantees the Company's obligations under the Bank
Credit Agreement, it will cause such Subsidiary to, concurrently therewith,
enter into a Joinder Agreement or otherwise deliver another Guarantee Agreement
reasonably acceptable to the Required Holders, in each case, for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and
agreed that no Subsidiary shall become a borrower or an obligor under the Bank
Credit Agreement, other than by reason of a Guaranty thereof (which Guaranty of
the Bank Credit Agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement).

     Concurrently with the delivery of a Joinder Agreement or another Guarantee
Agreement by a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Section 9.7, the Company
will cause such Subsidiary to deliver appropriate corporate resolutions, other
corporate documentation and legal opinions (such legal opinions to be from staff
or independent counsel, in each case, reasonably


                                      -22-

satisfactory to the Required Holders), all in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Required Holders and their counsel.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Guarantor is no
longer obligated to any Lender pursuant to any Guaranty thereof and (x) no
Default or Event of Default exists or would exist immediately after such
release, and (y) such Guarantor is not a Material Subsidiary (including as a
result of a sale, transfer or other conveyance of such Guarantor permitted by
Section 10.6), the holders of the Notes hereby agree to, and they hereby do,
release such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantee Agreement. The
holders of the Notes will evidence such release pursuant to such instruments of
release as may be reasonably requested by the Company. For avoidance of doubt, a
disposition of a Guarantor that is permitted by Section 10.6 shall result in the
release of such Guarantor provided that the terms and conditions of this Section
9.7(b) are then satisfied.

     (c) For purposes of this Section 9.7, "MATERIAL SUBSIDIARY" means each
Domestic Subsidiary (i) the EBITDA of which, as of the most recent fiscal
quarter of the Company, for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then
ended, for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section
7.1(a) and (b) was greater than five percent (5%) of Consolidated EBITDA for
such period or (ii) the consolidated total assets of which as of the end of such
fiscal quarter were greater than five percent (5%) of Consolidated Total Assets
as of such date; provided that, if at any time the aggregate amount of the
EBITDA or consolidated total assets of all Domestic Subsidiaries that are not
Guarantors exceeds ten percent (10%) of Consolidated EBITDA for any such period
or ten percent (10%) of Consolidated Total Assets as of the end of any such
fiscal quarter, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 30 days)
designate sufficient Domestic Subsidiaries as "Material Subsidiaries" to
eliminate such excess, and such designated Subsidiaries shall for all purposes
of this Agreement constitute Guarantors.

     SECTION 9.8. PARI PASSU RANKING. (a) The Company's obligations under the
Financing Agreements will at all times rank at least pari passu, without
preference or priority, with all of its other outstanding unsubordinated
unsecured Indebtedness (including, without limitation, the Bank Credit Agreement
and the other Loan Documents). Each Obligor's (other than the Company)
obligations under the Financing Agreements will at all times rank at least pari
passu, without preference or priority, with all of such Obligor's other
outstanding unsubordinated unsecured Indebtedness (including, without
limitation, the Bank Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents).

     In addition to the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, if at any time
the Company or any other Obligor is required to grant a security interest in or
pledge any assets pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 9.8, then (i) the
Company's obligations under, and any security interest in Collateral granted
under, the Financing Agreements will at all times rank at least pari passu,
without preference or priority, with all of its obligations under the Bank
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents secured by the same Collateral and
(ii) each Obligor's (other than the Company) obligations under, and any security
interest in Collateral granted under, the Financing Agreements will at all times
rank at least pari passu, without preference or priority, with all of such
Obligor's obligations under the Bank Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents secured by the same Collateral.

     (b) Each Obligor hereby covenants and agrees that, if such Obligor or any
Subsidiary grants a security interest and Lien in any Collateral as security for
the Company's or any Subsidiary's obligations under the Bank Credit Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, it will, and/or will cause such Subsidiary to,
concurrently therewith, (a) grant to the holders of the Notes or a Collateral
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Lenders, a
security interest in such property pursuant to Collateral Documents acceptable
to the Required Holders, on a pari passu basis with the Lenders and (b) deliver
appropriate corporate resolutions, other corporate documentation and legal
opinions (such legal opinions to be from staff or independent counsel, in each
case, reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders), all in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and their counsel.
Each Obligor further agrees to deliver to the Collateral Agent (with a copy to
each holder of the Notes) or directly to the holders of the Notes, as the case
may be, all such Collateral Documents, together with appropriate corporate
documentation, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Required Holders and their counsel, and in a manner that the Required Holders
shall be satisfied that the holders have a first priority perfected security
interest and Lien in such property. Each Obligor shall ensure that at the time
that such Obligor or any Subsidiary grants a security interest and Lien in any
Collateral as security for the Company's or any Subsidiary's obligations under
the Bank Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, such security interest
and Lien is subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
is in full force and effect and that the Lenders are a party thereto.

     SECTION 10. NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

     The Obligors, jointly and severally, covenant that so long as any of the
Notes are outstanding:

     SECTION 10.1. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. No Obligor will, or will permit
any Subsidiary to, enter into directly or indirectly any transaction or group of
related transactions (including without limitation the purchase, lease, sale or
exchange of properties of any kind or the rendering of any service) with any
Affiliate (other than any Obligor or another Subsidiary), except (a) in the
ordinary course of business and at prices and/or terms and conditions no less
favorable to such Obligor or such Subsidiary than would be obtained on an
arm's-length basis with a Person not an Affiliate, (b) advances to officers,
directors or employees of such Obligor or such Subsidiary in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice, (c) employment, indemnification, and
compensation arrangements (including arrangements made with respect to bonuses
and equity-based awards) entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice with members of the board of directors, officers
and employees of such Obligor or such Subsidiary and (d) any payment of
dividends, redemptions of stock or other distributions to the shareholders of
such Obligor or such Subsidiary, provided, that in the case of the transactions
in clause (d), no Default or Event of Default exists at the time of, or would
exist after giving effect to, such transactions.

     SECTION 10.2. MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, ETC. No Obligor will consolidate with
or merge with any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially
all of its assets in a single transaction or series of transactions to any
Person (except that any Obligor may merge with or into, or convey, transfer or
lease all or substantially all of its assets to, the Company or another

Obligor if (1) in any such merger or consolidation involving the Company, the
Company is the survivor and (2) immediately after giving effect to any such
merger, consolidation or conveyance, transfer or lease, no Default or Event of
Default would exist) unless :

          (a) the successor formed by such consolidation or the survivor of such
     merger or the Person that acquires by conveyance, transfer or lease all or
     substantially all of the assets of such Obligor as an entirety, as the case
     may be, shall be a solvent corporation, limited liability company, limited
     partnership or business trust organized and existing under the laws of the
     United States or any State thereof (including the District of Columbia),
     and, if such Obligor is not such corporation, limited liability company,
     limited partnership or business trust, (i) such corporation, limited
     liability company, limited partnership or business trust shall have
     executed and delivered to each holder of any Notes its assumption of the
     due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition
     of the Financing Agreements to which such Obligor is a party, (ii) such
     corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or business
     trust shall have caused to be delivered to each holder of any Notes an
     opinion of staff or independent counsel, in each case, reasonably
     satisfactory to the Required Holders, to the effect that all agreements or
     instruments effecting such assumption are enforceable in accordance with
     their terms and comply with the terms hereof and (iii) each other Obligor
     who was not a party to such consolidation, merger or conveyance, transfer
     or lease of assets, shall have executed and delivered an acknowledgement
     that the Financing Agreements to which they are a party continue in full
     force and effect; and

          (b) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such
     transaction, (i) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing and (ii) such Obligor (or the successor to such Obligor, as the
     case may be) could incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
     to Sections 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10, treating such transaction, for purposes
     of determining compliance with Sections 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10, as having
     been consummated as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal
     quarter.

No such conveyance, transfer or lease of substantially all of the assets of an
Obligor shall have the effect of releasing such Obligor or any successor
corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or business trust
that shall theretofore have become such in the manner prescribed in this Section
10.2 from its liability under the Financing Agreements to which it is a party,
other than the release of a Guarantor pursuant to the terms and conditions of
Section 9.7(b).

     This Section 10.2 shall not prohibit a disposition of a Subsidiary or the
assets thereof (including as a result of any merger or consolidation) if such
disposition is pursuant to and in accordance with the provision of Section 10.6

     SECTION 10.3. LINE OF BUSINESS. Each Obligor will not and will not permit
any Subsidiary to engage in any business if, as a result, the general nature of
the business in which the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, would
then be engaged would be substantially changed

the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List of the Office of
Foreign Assets Control or in Section 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Order or (b) with
the actual knowledge of any Senior Financial Officer of any Obligor, engage in
any material dealings or transactions with any such Person.

     SECTION 10.5. LIENS. No Obligor will, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to,

happening of a contingency or otherwise) any Lien on or with respect to any
property or asset (including, without limitation, any document or instrument in
respect of goods or accounts receivable) of such Obligor or any such Subsidiary,
whether now owned or held or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits

     such Obligor and its Subsidiaries or the ownership of their property,

          (f) easements, zoning restrictions, rights of way and similar

     taken as a whole;

          within 180 days after, such acquisition or the completion of such
          construction, or

               (ii) any Lien in property existing in such property at the time

     Subsidiaries under the Financing Agreements and the Bank Credit Agreement
     and the other Loan Documents, on a pari passu basis, provided, that the
     Intercreditor Agreement is entered into by the holders of the Notes and
     each Lender with respect to such Collateral and is in full force and
     effect; and

          (o) Liens on assets (other than the Collateral) securing Indebtedness
     of such Obligor or any Subsidiary in addition to those described in clauses
     (a) through (n) above, provided, that no such Liens shall be incurred if at
     the time thereof or after giving effect thereto, a Default or Event of
     Default exists or would exist hereunder, including, without limitation,
     under Section 10.7.

     For the purposes of this Section 10.5, all of the Liens of any Person
becoming a Subsidiary after the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be
outstanding Liens at the time it becomes a Subsidiary, and any Obligor or
Subsidiary extending, renewing or refunding any Indebtedness secured by any Lien
shall be deemed to have incurred such Lien at the time of such extension,
renewal or refunding.

     SECTION 10.6. SALE OF ASSETS. Except as permitted under Section 10.2, no
Obligor will, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

          (a) in the good faith opinion of such Obligor or Subsidiary making the
     Asset Disposition, the Asset Disposition is in exchange for consideration
     having a fair market value at least equal to that of the property exchanged

     in the best interest of such Obligor or such Subsidiary;

          (b) immediately after giving effect to the Asset Disposition, (i) no
     Default or Event of Default would exist and (ii) such Obligor or such
     Subsidiary could incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
     to Sections 10.8, 10.9 and 10.10, assuming such Asset Disposition occurred
     as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter; and

          (c) immediately after giving effect to the Asset Disposition, the sum
     of (i) the Disposition Value of the property subject to such Asset
     Disposition, plus (ii) the aggregate Disposition Value for all other
     property that was the subject of an Asset Disposition during the then
     current fiscal year, would not exceed 15% of Consolidated Total Assets
     determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year preceding
     such Asset Disposition.

To the extent that the Net Sales Amount arising from Asset Dispositions is
applied or offered to be applied to a Debt Prepayment Application or applied to
a Property Reinvestment Application, in each case, within one year after such
Asset Disposition, then such Asset Disposition (or, if less than all such Net
Sales Amount is applied as contemplated hereinabove, the pro rata percentage
thereof which corresponds to the Net Sales Amount so applied (or offered in the
case of a Debt

subsection (c) of this Section 10.6 as of any date, shall be deemed not to be an
Asset Disposition.

in the release of such Guarantor provided that the terms and conditions of
Section 9.7(b) are then satisfied.

     SECTION 10.7. PRIORITY DEBT. The Company will not, at any time, permit
Priority Debt to exceed 20% of Consolidated Net Worth. For purposes of this
Section 10.7, Consolidated Net Worth shall be determined as of the end of the
most recently ended fiscal quarter.

     SECTION 10.8. SUBSIDIARY DEBT LIMITATION. The Company will not, at any
time, permit any Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume,
guarantee, have outstanding, or otherwise become or remain directly or
indirectly liable with respect to, any Indebtedness other than:

          (a) Indebtedness of a Guarantor that is subject to the Intercreditor
     Agreement;

          (b) Indebtedness of a Guarantor that is not subject to the
     Intercreditor Agreement in an aggregate amount for such Guarantor not in
     excess of $20,000,000, provided that if such Indebtedness is in excess of
     $20,000,000, then all Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not subject to
     the Intercreditor Agreement (including all amounts less than $20,000,000)
     shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this Section 10.8
     unless otherwise permitted by another paragraph of this Section 10.8;

     Subsidiary;

          (e) Indebtedness of a Subsidiary outstanding at the time such
     Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary and any extension or renewal of such
     Indebtedness that does not increase the principal amount then outstanding,
     provided that (i) such Indebtedness shall not have been incurred in
     contemplation of such Subsidiary becoming a Subsidiary and (ii) immediately
     after such Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary (and, if applicable, at the time
     of any such renewal or extension) no Default or Event of Default shall
     exist; and

          (f) Indebtedness of a Subsidiary in addition to that otherwise
     permitted by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this Section 10.8, provided that
     on the date such Subsidiary incurs or otherwise becomes liable with respect
     to any such additional Indebtedness and immediately after giving effect
     thereto and the concurrent retirement of any other Indebtedness, no Default
     or Event of Default exists under Section 10.7 or, assuming the incurrence
     of such additional Indebtedness and the concurrent retirement of such other

     quarter, no Default or Event of Default would exist under Sections 10.9 and
     10.10.

     SECTION 10.9. CONSOLIDATED TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO CONSOLIDATED EBITDA. The
Company will not permit, as at the end of each fiscal quarter, the ratio of
Consolidated Total Indebtedness outstanding on such date to Consolidated EBITDA
for the immediately preceding four quarter period ending with the end of such
fiscal quarter, to be greater than 3.00 to 1.00.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of determining the ratio of
Consolidated Total Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA pursuant to this Section
10.9, any Indebtedness incurred by the Company in order to make settlement
advances to or on behalf of processing customers in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice shall not be included in the calculation
of Consolidated Total Indebtedness to the extent that such Indebtedness is
repaid within 5 days after the incurrence thereof.

     SECTION 10.10. MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE. The Company will not permit,

encompasses clause (i) of Section 11(g)) has occurred, all the Notes then
outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

     (b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any
holder or holders of at least 51% in principal amount of the Notes at the time
outstanding may at any time at its or their option, by notice or notices to the
Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and
payable.

     (c) If any Event of Default described in Section 11(a) or (b) has occurred
and is continuing, any holder or holders of Notes at the time outstanding
affected by such Event of Default may at any time, at its or their option, by
notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes held by it or them to be
immediately due and payable.

     Upon any Notes becoming due and payable under this Section 12.1, whether
automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire
unpaid principal amount of such Notes, plus (x) all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon (including, but not limited to, interest accrued thereon at the Default
Rate) and (y) the Make-Whole Amount determined in respect of such principal
amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be
immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand,
protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived. Each Obligor
acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note has the
right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the Company
(except as herein specifically provided for) and that the provision for payment
of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or
are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.

     SECTION 12.2. OTHER REMEDIES. If any Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of whether any Notes have become or
have been declared immediately due and payable under Section 12.1, the holder of
any Note at the time outstanding may proceed to protect and enforce the rights
of such holder by an action at law, suit in equity or other appropriate
proceeding, whether for the specific performance of any agreement contained
herein, in any Note or in any other Financing Agreement, or for an injunction
against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

     SECTION 12.3. RESCISSION. At any time after any Notes have been declared
due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1(b) or (c), the Required Holders, by
notice to the Company, may rescind and annul any such declaration and its
consequences if (a) the Company has paid all overdue interest on the Notes, all
principal of and Make-Whole Amount, if any, on any Notes that are due and
payable and are unpaid other than by reason of such declaration, and all
interest on such overdue principal and Make-Whole Amount, if any, and (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) any overdue interest in respect of the
Notes, at the Default Rate, (b) neither the Company nor any other Person shall
have paid any amounts which have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, (c) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than non-payment of
amounts that have become due solely by reason of such declaration, have been
cured or have been waived pursuant to Section 17, and (d) no judgment or decree
has been entered for the

annulment under this Section 12.3 will extend to or affect any subsequent Event
of Default or Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

     SECTION 12.4. NO WAIVERS OR ELECTION OF REMEDIES, EXPENSES, ETC. No course
of dealing and no delay on the part of any holder of any Note in exercising any
right, power or remedy shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice
such holder's rights, powers or remedies. No right, power or remedy conferred by
this Agreement, any Note or any other Financing Agreement upon any holder
thereof shall be exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to
herein or therein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or
otherwise. Without limiting the obligations of the Company under Section 15, the
Company will pay to the holder of each Note on demand such further amount as
shall be sufficient to cover all costs and expenses of such holder incurred in
any enforcement or collection under this Section 12, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses and disbursements.

     SECTION 13.1. REGISTRATION OF NOTES. The Company shall keep at its
principal executive office a register for the registration and registration of

registration of transfer, the Person in whose name any Note shall be registered

instrument of transfer duly executed by the registered holder of such Note or
such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing and accompanied by the
relevant name, address and other information for notices of each transferee of
such Note or part thereof), within ten Business Days thereafter, the Company
shall execute and deliver, at the Company's expense (except as provided below),
one or more new Notes (as requested by the holder thereof) in exchange therefor,
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of the
surrendered Note. Each such new Note shall be payable to such Person as such
holder may request and shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1. Each
such new Note shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest
shall have been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the
surrendered Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon. The Company may

charge imposed in respect of any such transfer of Notes. Notes shall not be
transferred in denominations of less than $1,000,000, other than (a) if

holding of Notes, one Note may be in a denomination of less than $1,000,000, (b)

address and to the attention of the designated officer (all as specified in
Section 18(iii)) of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the ownership of

Investor of such ownership and such loss, theft, destruction or mutilation), and

          (a) in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity reasonably
     satisfactory to it (provided that if the holder of such Note is, or is a
     nominee for, an original Purchaser or another holder of a Note with a
     minimum net worth of at least $50,000,000 or a Qualified Institutional
     Buyer, such Person's own unsecured agreement of indemnity shall be deemed
     to be satisfactory), or

          (b) in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
     thereof,

within ten Business Days thereafter, the Company at its own expense shall
execute and deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note, dated and bearing interest
from the date to which interest shall have been paid on such lost, stolen,

mutilated Note if no interest shall have been paid thereon.

long as such place of payment shall be either the principal office of the
Company in such jurisdiction or the principal office of a bank or trust company
in such jurisdiction.

     SECTION 14.2. HOME OFFICE PAYMENT. So long as any Purchaser or its nominee
shall be the holder of any Note, and notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 14.1 or in such Note to the contrary, the Company will pay all sums
becoming due on such Note for principal, Make- Whole Amount, if any, and
interest by the method and at the address specified for such purpose below such
Purchaser's name in Schedule A, or by such other method or at such other address

by the Company pursuant to Section 14.1. Prior to any sale or other disposition
of any Note held by a Purchaser or its nominee, such Purchaser will, at its

certificate or other instrument delivered by or on behalf of any Obligor
pursuant to any Financing Agreement shall be true and correct as of the date
made and shall be deemed representations and warranties of such Obligor under

SECTION 17. AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.

     SECTION 17.1. REQUIREMENTS. This Agreement, the Notes and the other
Financing Agreements may be amended, and the observance of any term hereof, of
the Notes or of any other Financing Agreement may be waived (either
retroactively or prospectively), with (and only with) the written consent of the
Obligors and the Required Holders, except that (a) no amendment or waiver of any
of the provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 21 or 22 hereof, or any defined
term (as it is used therein), will be effective as to any Purchaser unless
consented to by such Purchaser in writing, and (b) no such amendment or waiver
may, without the written consent of the holder of each Note at the time
outstanding affected thereby, (i) subject to the provisions of Section 12
relating to acceleration or rescission, change the amount or time of any
prepayment or payment of principal of, or reduce the rate or change the time of
payment or method of computation of interest or of the Make-Whole Amount on, the
Notes, (ii) change the percentage of the principal amount of the Notes the
holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment or waiver, or
(iii) amend any of Sections 8, 11(a), 11(b), 12, 17, 20 or 22.

     SECTION 17.2. SOLICITATION OF HOLDERS OF NOTES.

     (a) Solicitation. The Company will provide each holder of the Notes
(irrespective of the amount of Notes then owned by it) with reasonably
sufficient information, reasonably far enough in advance of the date a decision
is required, to enable such holder to make an informed and considered decision
with respect to any proposed amendment, waiver or consent in respect of any of
the provisions hereof or of the Notes. The Company will deliver executed or true
and correct copies of each amendment, waiver or consent effected pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 17 to each holder of outstanding Notes promptly
following the date on which it is executed and delivered by, or receives the
consent or approval of, the requisite holders of Notes.

     (b) Payment. No Obligor will directly or indirectly pay or cause to be paid
any remuneration, whether by way of supplemental or additional interest, fee or
otherwise, or grant any security or provide other credit support, to any holder
of Notes as consideration for or as an inducement to the entering into by any
holder of Notes of any waiver or amendment of any of the terms and provisions
hereof unless such remuneration is concurrently paid, or security is
concurrently granted or other credit support concurrently provided, on the same
terms, ratably to each holder of Notes then outstanding even if such holder did
not consent to such waiver or amendment.

     SECTION 17.3. BINDING EFFECT, ETC. Any amendment or waiver consented to as
provided in this Section 17 applies equally to all holders of Notes and is
binding upon them and upon each future holder of any Note and upon the Obligors
without regard to whether such Note has been marked to indicate such amendment
or waiver. No such amendment or waiver will extend to or affect any obligation,
covenant, agreement, Default or Event of Default not expressly amended or waived
or impair any right consequent thereon. No course of dealing between the
Obligors and the holder of any Note nor any delay in exercising any rights
hereunder or under any Note shall operate as a waiver of any rights of any
holder of such Note. As used herein, the term "this Agreement" and references
thereto shall mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or
supplemented.

     No. (480) 629-1499; Email address: George_W_Gresham@efunds.com), or at such
     other address as the Company shall have specified to the holder of each
     Note in writing.

Notices under this Section 18 will be deemed given (i) when actually received if
sent by email communication or telefacsimile, (ii) in four Business Days if sent
by mail, and (iii) in one Business Day if sent by overnight delivery service.

SECTION 19. REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS.

     This Agreement and all documents relating thereto, including, without
limitation, (a) consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, (b) documents received by any Purchaser at the Closing (except the
Notes themselves), and (c) financial statements, certificates and other
information previously or hereafter furnished to any Purchaser, may be
reproduced by such Purchaser by any photographic, photostatic, electronic,

document so reproduced. The Obligors agree and stipulate that, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, any such

reproduction shall be admissible in evidence as the original itself in any
judicial or administrative proceeding (whether or not the original is in
existence and whether or not such reproduction was made by such Purchaser in the
regular course of business) and any enlargement, facsimile or further
reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence. This
Section 19 shall not prohibit the Obligors or any other holder of Notes from
contesting any such reproduction to the same extent that it could contest the
original, or from introducing evidence to demonstrate the inaccuracy of any such
reproduction.

SECTION 20. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

     For the purposes of this Section 20, "Confidential Information" means
information delivered to any Purchaser by or on behalf of any Obligor or any
Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement that is proprietary in nature and that was clearly
marked or labeled or otherwise adequately identified when received by such
Purchaser as being confidential information of such Obligor or such Subsidiary,
provided that such term does not include information that (a) was publicly known
or otherwise known to such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b)
subsequently becomes publicly known through no act or omission by such Purchaser
or any person acting on such Purchaser's behalf, (c) otherwise becomes known to
such Purchaser other than through disclosure by such Obligor or such Subsidiary
or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser under
Section 7.1 that are otherwise publicly available. Each Purchaser will maintain
the confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with
procedures adopted by such Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential
information of third parties delivered to such Purchaser, provided that such
Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential Information to (i) its directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys and affiliates (to the extent such
disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of the investment
represented by its Notes), (ii) its financial advisors and other professional
advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential Information
substantially in accordance with the terms of this Section 20, (iii) any other
holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which it sells or offers
to sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation therein (if such
Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential
Information to be bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (v) any Person
from which it offers to purchase any security of an Obligor (if such Person has
agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential Information to be
bound by the provisions of this Section 20), (vi) any federal or state
regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Purchaser, (vii) the NAIC or
the SVO or, in each case, any similar organization, or any nationally recognized
rating agency that requires access to information about such Purchaser's
investment portfolio, or (viii) any other Person to which such delivery or
disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w) to effect compliance with any
law, rule, regulation or order applicable to such Purchaser, (x) in response to
any subpoena or other legal process, (y) in connection with any litigation to
which such Purchaser is a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing, to the extent such Purchaser may reasonably determine such
delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement or for
the protection of the rights and remedies under such Purchaser's Notes, this
Agreement and the other Financing Agreements, provided that prior to disclosure
under this clause (viii) (other than sub clause (z) thereof), such Purchaser
will endeavor to provide notice to the Company reasonably far enough in advance
to enable the Company to seek protective orders to maintain the confidentiality
of information to be so


                                      -39-

disclosed, provided, however, such Purchaser shall have no liability for its
failure to so notify the Company. Each holder of a Note, by its acceptance of a
Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the
benefits of this Section 20 as though it were a party to this Agreement. On
reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery to any holder
of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder under this
Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a party to
this Agreement or its nominee), such holder will enter into an agreement with
the Company embodying the provisions of this Section 20. Each Purchaser agrees
that for purposes of the Company's compliance with Regulation FD of the SEC, the
provisions of this Section 20 constitute a confidentiality agreement within the
meaning of Rule 100(b)(2)(ii) of Regulation FD of the SEC.

SECTION 21. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.

     Each Purchaser shall have the right to substitute any one of its Affiliates
as the purchaser of the Notes that it has agreed to purchase hereunder, by
notice to the Company, which notice shall be signed by both such Purchaser and
such Affiliate, shall contain such Affiliate's agreement to be bound by this
Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Affiliate of the accuracy
with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6. Such
substituted Purchaser shall provide to the Company in such notice of such
transfer information reasonably requested by the Company in order to facilitate
delivery of notices to such substituted Purchaser, including wire transfer
information similar to the information provided by other Purchasers in Schedule
A. Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this
Agreement (other than in this Section 21), shall be deemed to refer to such
Affiliate in lieu of such original Purchaser. In the event that such Affiliate
is so substituted as a Purchaser hereunder and such Affiliate thereafter
transfers to such original Purchaser all of the Notes then held by such
Affiliate, upon receipt by the Company of notice of such transfer, any reference
to such Affiliate as a "Purchaser" in this Agreement (other than in this Section
21), shall no longer be deemed to refer to such Affiliate, but shall refer to
such original Purchaser, and such original Purchaser shall again have all the
rights of an original holder of the Notes under this Agreement.

SECTION 22. GUARANTEE AGREEMENT.

     SECTION 22.1. GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS. (a) Each Guarantor hereby,
irrevocably, unconditionally, absolutely, jointly and severally with each other
Guarantor, guarantees to each holder of Notes, as and for such Guarantor's own
debt, until final and indefeasible payment has been made the due and punctual
payment by the Company of the principal of, and interest (including default
interest and post-petition interest), and the Make-Whole Amount or any other
premium on, the Notes at any time outstanding and the due and punctual payment
of all other amounts payable, and all other Indebtedness owing, by the Company
to the holders of the Notes under this Agreement, the Notes and the other
Financing Agreements (all such obligations so guaranteed are herein collectively
referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations"), in each case when and as the same
shall become due and payable, whether at maturity, pursuant to mandatory or
optional prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise, all in accordance with the
terms and provisions hereof and thereof.

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     (b) In addition to and without limiting the foregoing, each of the
Guarantors covenants that, so long as any Guaranteed Obligations shall remain
unpaid, it will, and, if necessary, will enable the Company to, fully comply
with those covenants and agreements of the Company and such Guarantor applicable
to such Guarantor set forth in this Agreement and the other Financing
Agreements.

     SECTION 22.2. PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. In the event that the
Company fails to make, on or before the due date thereof, any payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or if any Obligor shall fail to perform, keep, observe,
or fulfill any other obligation referred to in clause (a) or clause (b) of
Section 22.1 in the manner provided in this Agreement, the Notes or the other
Financing Agreements after in each case giving effect to any applicable grace
periods or cure provisions or waivers or amendments, each Guarantor shall cause
forthwith to be paid the moneys, or to be performed, kept, observed, or
fulfilled each of such obligations, in respect of which such failure has
occurred in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the
Notes and the other Financing Agreements.

     SECTION 22.3. WAIVERS. To the fullest extent permitted by law, each
Guarantor does hereby waive:

          (a) notice of acceptance of this Guarantee Agreement;

          (b) notice of any purchase of the Notes under this Agreement, or the
     creation, existence or acquisition of any of the Guaranteed Obligations,
     subject to such Guarantor's right to make inquiry of each holder of Notes
     to ascertain the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations at any reasonable
     time;

          (c) notice of the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, subject to
     such Guarantor's right to make inquiry of each holder of Notes to ascertain
     the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations at any reasonable time;

          (d) notice of adverse change in the financial condition of the
     Company, any other Obligor or any other guarantor or any other fact that
     might increase or expand such Guarantor's risk hereunder;

          (e) notice of any Default or Event of Default;

          (f) all other notices and demands to which such Guarantor might
     otherwise be entitled;

          (g) the defense of the "single action" rule or any similar right or
     protection, and the right by statute or otherwise to require any holder of
     Notes to institute suit against the Company, any other Obligor or any other
     guarantor or to exhaust its rights and remedies against the Company, any
     other Obligor or any other guarantor, such Guarantor being bound to the
     payment of each and all Guaranteed Obligations, whether now existing or
     hereafter accruing, as fully as if such Guaranteed Obligations were
     directly owing to the holders of Notes by such Guarantor;

<PAGE>

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

          (h) any defense of the Company or any other Obligor under the Notes,
     this Agreement or any other Financing Agreement other than the full and
     timely performance thereof;

          (i) any defense relating to the validity or enforceability (or absence
     or failure thereof) of any term of the Notes, this Agreement or any other
     Financing Agreement;

          (j) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense
     (other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been
     fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid) of the Company or by
     reason of the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the
     Company in respect thereof, and any other defense that such Guarantor may
     otherwise have against the Company or any holder of Notes;

          (k) any stay (except in connection with a pending appeal), valuation,
     appraisal redemption or extension law now or at any time hereafter in force
     which, but for this waiver, might be applicable to any sale of property of
     such Guarantor made under any judgment, order or decree based on this
     Agreement, and such Guarantor covenants that it will not at any time insist
     upon or plead, or in any manner claim or take the benefit or advantage of
     such law;

          (l) any defense based on an increase in principal amount of the Notes
     or the interest rate thereunder; and

          (m) any other defense which such Guarantor may have to the full and
     complete performance of its obligations hereunder.

     SECTION 22.4. CERTAIN WAIVERS OF SUBROGATION, REIMBURSEMENT AND INDEMNITY.
Until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been fully and finally paid,
each Guarantor shall have no right of subrogation, reimbursement or indemnity
whatsoever and no right of recourse to or with respect to any assets or property
of the Company, any other Obligor or any other guarantor. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Guarantor will in the event of a dissolution of an Obligor: (a)
take steps to recover (whether directly or by set-off, counterclaim or
otherwise) or accept money or other property, or exercise or enforce rights in
respect of, Indebtedness of that Obligor to that Guarantor so long as there is
any Guaranteed Obligations due by that Obligor, nor (b) claim, prove or accept
payment in composition by, or a dissolution of, that Obligor in competition with
any holder of Notes. Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of a
Guarantor hereunder except the full and final performance and indefeasible
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations.

     SECTION 22.5. RELEASES. Each Guarantor consents and agrees that, without
notice to or by such Guarantor and without impairing, releasing, abating,
deferring, suspending, reducing, terminating or otherwise affecting the
obligations of such Guarantor hereunder, each holder of Notes, in the manner
provided herein, by action or inaction, may:

          (a) compromise or settle, renew or extend the period of duration or
     the time for the payment, or discharge the performance of, or may refuse
     to, or otherwise not,

     enforce, or may, by action or inaction, release all or any one or more
     parties to, any one or more of this Agreement, the Notes or the other
     Financing Agreements;

          (b) assign, sell or transfer, or otherwise dispose of, any one or more
     of the Notes;

          (c) grant waivers, extensions, consents and other indulgences to the
     Company, any other Obligor or any other guarantor in respect of any one or
     more of this Agreement, the Notes or the other Financing Agreements;

          (d) amend, modify or supplement in any manner and at any time (or from
     time to time) any one or more of this Agreement, the Notes or the other
     Financing Agreements or increase the principal amount of the Notes or the
     interest rate thereunder;

          (e) add, release or substitute any one or more of the endorsers or
     guarantors of the Guaranteed Obligations whether parties hereto or not;

          (f) sell, exchange, release or surrender any property at any time
     pledged or granted as security in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations,
     whether so pledged or granted by such Guarantor or another guarantor of any
     Company's obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or the other
     Financing Agreements;

          (g) exchange, enforce, waive, or release, by action or inaction, any
     security for the Guaranteed Obligations or any other guarantee of any of
     the Notes; and

          (h) do any other act or event which could have the effect of releasing
     any Guarantor from the full and complete performance of its obligations
     hereunder.

     SECTION 22.6. MARSHALING. Each Guarantor consents and agrees that:

          (a) each holder of Notes shall be under no obligation to marshal any
     assets in favor of such Guarantor or against or in payment of any or all of
     the Guaranteed Obligations; and

          (b) to the extent the Company or another guarantor makes a payment or
     payments to any holder of Notes, which payment or payments or any part
     thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
     preferential, set aside, or required, for any of the foregoing reasons or
     for any other reason, to be repaid or paid over to a custodian, trustee,
     receiver, or any other party under any bankruptcy law, common law, or
     equitable cause, then to the extent of such payment or repayment, the
     obligation or part thereof intended to be satisfied thereby shall be
     revived and continued in full force and effect as if said payment or
     payments had not been made and such Guarantor shall be primarily liable for
     such obligation.

     SECTION 22.7. LIABILITY. Each Guarantor agrees that the liability of such
Guarantor in respect of this Section shall be immediate, and shall not be
contingent upon the exercise or


                                      -43-

enforcement by any holder of Notes of whatever remedies such holder may have
against the Company, any other Obligor or any other guarantor or the enforcement
of any Lien or realization upon any security such holder may at any time
possess.

     SECTION 22.8. CHARACTER OF OBLIGATION. The Guaranty set forth in this
Section is a primary and original obligation of each Guarantor and is an
absolute, unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guarantee of payment and
performance (and not of collectibility) and shall remain in full force and
effect until the full, final and indefeasible payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations without respect to future changes in conditions.

     The obligations of each Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement and the
rights of the holders of Notes to enforce such obligations by any proceedings,
whether by action at law, suit in equity or otherwise, shall not be subject to
any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination, whether by reason of any
claim of any character whatsoever or otherwise, including, without limitation,
claims of waiver, release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be
subject to any defense, set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination
whatsoever, other than the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations have been
fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid in full in cash.

     Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected
by:

          (a) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the
     performance by the Company of any obligations of any kind or character
     whatsoever of the Company;

          (b) any creditors' rights, bankruptcy, receivership or other
     insolvency proceeding of the Company or any other Person or in respect of
     the property of the Company or any other Person or any merger,
     consolidation, reorganization, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of
     the Company or any other Person;

          (c) impossibility or illegality of performance on the part of the
     Company of its obligations under the Notes, this Agreement, any other
     Financing Agreement or any other instruments or agreements;

          (d) the validity or enforceability of the Notes, this Agreement, any
     other Financing Agreement or any other instruments or agreements;

          (e) in respect of the Company or any other Person, any change of
     circumstances, whether or not foreseen or foreseeable, whether or not
     imputable to the Company or any other Person, or other impossibility of
     performance through fire, explosion, accident, labor disturbance, floods,
     droughts, embargoes, wars (whether or not declared), civil commotions, acts
     of terrorism, acts of God or the public enemy, delays or failure of
     suppliers or carriers, inability to obtain materials, action of any federal
     or state regulatory body or agency, change of law or any other causes
     affecting performance, or any other force majeure, whether or not beyond
     the control of the Company or any other Person and whether or not of the
     kind hereinbefore specified;

          (f) any attachment, claim, demand, charge, lien, order, process,
     encumbrance or any other happening or event or reason, similar or
     dissimilar to the foregoing, or any withholding or diminution at the
     source, by reason of any taxes, assessments, expenses, debt, obligations or
     liabilities of any charter, foreseen or unforeseen, and whether or not
     valid, incurred by or against any Person, or any claims, demands, charges
     or Liens of any nature, foreseen or unforeseen, incurred by any Person, or
     against any sums payable under this Agreement, the Notes or any other
     Financing Agreement, so that such sums would be rendered inadequate or
     would be unavailable to make the payments herein provided;

          (g) any order, judgment, decree, law, ruling or regulation (whether or
     not valid) of any court of any nation or of any political subdivision
     thereof or any body, agency, department, official or administrative or
     regulatory agency of any thereof or any other action, happening, event or
     reason whatsoever which shall delay, interfere with, hinder or prevent, or
     in any way adversely affect, the performance by any party of its respective
     obligations under any instruments; or

          (h) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense
     available to, or a discharge of, any Guarantor in respect of the
     obligations of such Guarantor under this Guarantee Agreement, other than
     the defense that the Guaranteed Obligations have been fully and finally
     performed and indefeasibly paid in full in cash.

     SECTION 22.9. ELECTION TO PERFORM OBLIGATIONS. Any election by a Guarantor
to pay or otherwise perform any of the obligations of the Company under this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Financing Agreement, whether pursuant to this
Section or otherwise, shall not release the Company from such obligations
(except to the extent such obligation is indefeasibly performed) or any of such
Person's other obligations under this Agreement, the Notes or any other
Financing Agreement.

     SECTION 22.10. NO ELECTION. Each holder of Notes shall have the right to
seek recourse against any Guarantor to the fullest extent provided for in this
Section 22 and elsewhere as provided in this Agreement, the Notes and any other
Financing Agreement, and against the Company, to the full extent provided for in
this Agreement, the Notes and such other Financing Agreements. Each Guarantor
hereby acknowledges that it has other undertakings in this Agreement and running
in favor of each of the holders of Notes that are separate and apart from their
obligations under this Section 22. No election to proceed in one form of action
or proceeding, or against any party, or on any obligation, shall constitute a
waiver of the right of such holder of Notes to proceed in any other form of
action or proceeding or against other parties unless such holder of Notes has
expressly waived such right in writing. Specifically, but without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no action or proceeding by any holder of Notes
against the Company or any Guarantor under any document or instrument evidencing
obligations of the Company or such Guarantor to such holder of Notes shall serve
to diminish the liability of a Guarantor under this Agreement (including,
without limitation, this Section 22) except to the extent that such holder of
Notes finally and unconditionally shall have realized payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations by such action or proceeding, notwithstanding the effect of any such
action or proceeding upon such Guarantor's right of subrogation against the
Company.

eFUNDS CORPORATION                                       NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

     SECTION 22.11. SEVERABILITY. Each of the rights and remedies granted under
this Section 22 to the holder of Notes in respect of the Notes held by such
holder may be exercised by such holder without notice by such holder to, or the
consent of or any other action by, any other holder of Notes.

     SECTION 22.12. OTHER ENFORCEMENT RIGHTS. Each holder of Notes may proceed
to protect and enforce the Guaranty under this Section 22 by suit or suits or
proceedings in equity, at law or in bankruptcy, and whether for the specific
performance of any covenant or agreement contained in this Section 22 or in
execution or aid of any power herein granted or for the recovery of judgment for
or in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations or for the enforcement of any other
proper, legal or equitable remedy available under applicable law.

     SECTION 22.13. DELAY OR OMISSION; NO WAIVER. No course of dealing on the
part of any holder of Notes and no delay or failure on the part of such holder
to exercise any right under this Agreement, the Notes or the other Financing
Agreements shall impair such right or operate as a waiver of such right or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers and remedies hereunder. Every
right and remedy given in or by this Section 22 or by law to any holder of Notes
may be exercised from time to time as often as may be deemed expedient by such
Person.

     SECTION 22.14. RESTORATION OF RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. If any holder of Notes
shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this
Agreement, under any Note held by such holder or under any other Financing
Agreement and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason, or shall have been determined adversely to such holder, then and in
every such case each such holder, the Company and each Guarantor shall, except
as may be limited or affected by any determination in such proceeding, be
restored severally and respectively to their respective former positions
hereunder and thereunder, and thereafter the rights and remedies of such holder
shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

     SECTION 22.15. CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No remedy under this Agreement, the
Notes or the other Financing Agreements is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, but each and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any and
every other remedy given pursuant to this Agreement, the Notes or the other
Financing Agreements.

     SECTION 22.16. SURVIVAL. So long as the Guaranteed Obligations shall not
have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid, the obligations of
each Guarantor under this Section 22 shall survive the transfer and payment of
any Note and the payment in full of all the Notes.

     SECTION 22.17. MISCELLANEOUS. So long as the Guaranteed Obligations shall
not have been fully and finally performed and indefeasibly paid, each Guarantor
(to the fullest extent that it may lawfully do so) expressly waives any claim of
any nature arising out of any right of indemnity, contribution, reimbursement or
any similar right in respect of any payment made under this Section 22 or in
connection with this Section 22 or otherwise, or any claim of subrogation
arising with respect to any payment made under this Section 22 or otherwise,
against the Company or the estate of the Company (including Liens on the
property of the Company or


                                      -46-

the estate of the Company), in each case if, and for so long as, the Company is
the subject of any proceeding brought under any bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, insolvency, administration, readjustment of debt, dissolution or
liquidation law of any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in effect, and
further agrees that it will not file any claims against the Company or the
estate of the Company in the course of such proceeding in respect of the rights
referred to in this Section 22, and further agrees that each holder of Notes may
specifically enforce the provisions of this Section 22. This clause creates a
promise which is intended to create obligations enforceable at the suit of each
holder of Notes.

     If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, then the holders of
Notes shall have the right to declare all of the Guaranteed Obligations to be,
and such Guaranteed Obligations shall thereupon become, forthwith due and
payable, without any presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which have been expressly waived by the Company and each Guarantor, and
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration (or such Guaranteed Obligations from becoming automatically due and
payable) as against the Company. In any such event, the holders of Notes shall
have immediate recourse to each Guarantor to the fullest extent set forth
herein.

     SECTION 22.18. LIMITATION. Anything herein, in the Notes or in any other
Financing Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the liability of each
Guarantor under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Financing Agreements
shall in no event exceed an amount equal to the maximum amount which can be
guaranteed by such Guarantor under applicable laws relating to the insolvency of
debtors and fraudulent conveyance.

     SECTION 22.19. WRITTEN NOTICE. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 22, in the event of any acceleration of the Notes in accordance with the
provisions of Section 12 hereof, any requirement of written notice to, or demand
of, any Guarantor pursuant to this Section 22 shall be deemed automatically
satisfied upon such acceleration without further action on the part of any
holder (notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing any
notice, demand or acceleration).

SECTION 23. MISCELLANEOUS.

     SECTION 23.1. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All covenants and other agreements
contained in this Agreement and in the other Financing Agreements by or on
behalf of any of the parties hereto or thereto bind and inure to the benefit of
their respective successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any
subsequent holder of a Note) whether so expressed or not.

     SECTION 23.2. PAYMENTS DUE ON NON-BUSINESS DAYS. Anything in this
Agreement, the Notes or in any other Financing Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding (but without limiting the requirement in Section 8.5 that the
notice of any optional prepayment specify a Business Day as the date fixed for
such prepayment), any payment of principal of or Make-Whole Amount or interest
on any Note that is due on a date other than a Business Day shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day without including the additional days elapsed in
the computation of the interest payable on such next succeeding Business Day;
provided that if the maturity date of any Note is a date other than a Business
Day, the payment otherwise due on such maturity date shall

be made on the next succeeding Business Day and shall include the additional
days elapsed in the computation of interest payable on such next succeeding
Business Day.

     SECTION 23.3. ACCOUNTING TERMS. All accounting terms used herein or in any
other Financing Agreement which are not expressly defined in this Agreement or
such other Financing Agreement have the meanings respectively given to them in
accordance with GAAP. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, (i) all
computations made pursuant to this Agreement or in any other Financing Agreement
shall be made in accordance with GAAP, and (ii) all financial statements shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company notifies the holders of the
Notes that the Company requests an amendment to any provision hereof to
eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in
the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if any holder of
Notes notifies the Company that the Required Holders request an amendment to any
provision hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is
given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then
such provision shall be interpreted on the basis of GAAP as in effect and
applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such
notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision amended in accordance
herewith. In the event of any such notice and request for amendment, the
Obligors and the holders agree to promptly proceed in good faith to the
consummation of an amendment to the Financing Agreements to the end of negating
the effect of any such change in GAAP after the date hereof.

     SECTION 23.4. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall (to the full extent permitted by law)
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     SECTION 23.5. CONSTRUCTION, ETC. Each covenant contained herein shall be
construed (absent express provision to the contrary) as being independent of
each other covenant contained herein, so that compliance with any one covenant
shall not (absent such an express contrary provision) be deemed to excuse
compliance with any other covenant. Where any provision herein refers to action
to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from taking, such
provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken directly or
indirectly by such Person.

     For the avoidance of doubt, all Schedules and Exhibits attached to this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a part hereof.

     SECTION 23.6. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original but all of which together shall
constitute one instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies
hereof, each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, of the parties
hereto.

     SECTION 23.7. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with, and the rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law
of the State of New York excluding choice-of-law principles of the law of such
State that would permit the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than
such State.

     SECTION 23.8. JURISDICTION AND PROCESS; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. (a) Each
Obligor irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any New York
State or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Financing Agreement. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, each Obligor irrevocably waives and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, any claim that it is not
subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

     (b) Each Obligor consents to process being served by or on behalf of any
holder of Notes in any suit, action or proceeding of the nature referred to in
Section 23.8(a) by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or
any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to it at its address specified in Section 18 or at such other address
of which such holder shall then have been notified pursuant to said Section.
Each Obligor agrees that such service upon receipt (i) shall be deemed in every
respect effective service of process upon it in any such suit, action or
proceeding and (ii) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be
taken and held to be valid personal service upon and personal delivery to it.
Notices hereunder shall be conclusively presumed received as evidenced by a
delivery receipt furnished by the United States Postal Service or any reputable
commercial delivery service.

     (c) Nothing in this Section 23.8 shall affect the right of any holder of a
Note to serve process in any manner permitted by law, or limit any right that
the holders of any of the Notes may have to bring proceedings against an Obligor
in the courts of any appropriate jurisdiction or to enforce in any lawful manner
a judgment obtained in one jurisdiction in any other jurisdiction.

     (d) THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION BROUGHT ON
OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EXECUTED IN
CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH.
