INSOLVENCY
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">Reinsurer hereby agrees that, as to all reinsurance made, ceded, renewed or otherwise becoming
effective hereunder, the reinsurance shall be payable by Reinsurer on the basis of the liability of
Cedent under the Coinsured Contracts reinsured on an indemnity basis, directly to Cedent or to its
conservator, liquidator, receiver or other statutory successor without diminution because of (i)&nbsp;the insolvency,
liquidation or rehabilitation of Cedent, (ii)&nbsp;the appointment of a conservator, receiver,
liquidator or statutory successor of Cedent, or (iii)&nbsp;the failure of the conservator, receiver,
liquidator or statutory successor of Cedent to pay all or a portion of any claim. It is agreed
that any conservator, receiver, liquidator or statutory successor of Cedent shall give prompt
written notice to Reinsurer of the pendency or submission of a claim under any such Coinsured
Contracts within a reasonable time after such claim is filed in the receivership, conservation,
insolvency or liquidation proceeding. During the pendency of such claim, Reinsurer may
investigate such claim and interpose, at its own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to
be adjudicated, any defense available to Cedent or its conservator, receiver, liquidator or
statutory successor except where: (i)&nbsp;the Coinsured Contract specifies another payee of such
reinsurance in the event of the insolvency of Cedent and (ii)&nbsp;Reinsurer, with the consent of the
direct insureds has assumed such policy obligations of Cedent as its direct obligations to the
payees under such Coinsured
Contracts, in substitution for the obligations of Cedent to such payees. The expense thus incurred
by Reinsurer is chargeable against Cedent, subject to the approval of the court, as a part of the
expense of insolvency, liquidation or rehabilitation to the extent of a proportionate share of the
benefit which accrues to Cedent solely as a result of the defense undertaken by Reinsurer.

Adjustment&#148; is calculated as follows: First, for each taxable year with respect to each category

(as defined in Section&nbsp;1.848-2(f)(2)(i)(A) of the Income Tax Regulations) for such category (but
not including any DAC Adjustment incurred in such year) is multiplied by the applicable percentage
set forth in Section&nbsp;848 (c)(1) of the Code for such category. The sum, if any, from the preceding
sentence is then reduced by the amortization allowed Cedent under Section&nbsp;848(a)(2) of the Code for
such category, but only with regard to amounts capitalized per this Agreement under Section
1.848-2(f)(2)(i)(A). The result for a category, whether positive or negative, is then multiplied
by the quotient of: tr/(1-(tr x (1&#043;Y))), where tr = the maximum applicable marginal corporate
federal income tax rate (as defined in Section&nbsp;11(b)(1)(D) of the Code) for the taxable year, and Y
= the applicable percentage set forth in Section&nbsp;848(c)(1) for such category of Coinsured
Contracts. The aggregate amount of such calculations for all categories of Coinsured Contracts for
a taxable year (whether positive or negative) is the DAC Adjustment for the year.
