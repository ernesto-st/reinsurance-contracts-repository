The Closing Purchase Price shall be released to Seller on January 1, 2021; provided, however,  if this Agreement is terminated or the transactions contemplated herein are unwound in accordance with  ARTICLE VIII, the Closing Purchase Price shall be refunded to Buyer as set forth therein.                     (b)   No  later  than  twenty  (20)  days  following  the  expiration  of  the  Open  Enrollment Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer the D-SNP Membership File that shows the number of D- SNP  Enrollees  enrolled  in  Seller&#8217;s  or  UHC&#8217;s  D-SNP  plan  as  of  the  first  Business  Day  immediately  following the expiration of the Open Enrollment Period.  Seller shall provide any supporting documentation  with respect thereto reasonably requested by Buyer.  No later than twenty (20) days following the expiration  of the Open Enrollment Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the CHFS Membership File that shows the  number  of  Medicaid  Enrollees  enrolled  in  the  Molina  Plan&#8217;s  health  plans  as  of  the  first  Business  Day  immediately following the expiration of the Open Enrollment Period together with its calculation of the  Membership Purchase Price, which shall take into account any dispute that Buyer has with respect to the  D-SNP Membership File delivered by Seller to Buyer.  Seller shall have ten (10) days to review the CHFS  Membership File and in the event Seller delivers a dispute notice to Buyer during such ten (10) day period  with respect to the determination of the Membership Purchase Price, the applicable provisions of Section  1.7(c)(ii) and Section 1.7(c)(iii) shall apply mutatis mutandis.  If Seller does not deliver a dispute notice  during such ten (10) day period, then the Membership Purchase Price calculated by Buyer shall be deemed  final, binding and conclusive.

Subject to Section 1.7(c), within three (3)  Business Days following the final determination of the Membership Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay the  Membership Purchase Price to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)  designated by Seller.

During such Review Period, Buyer shall (A) provide  Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable prior  notice to the relevant books, records (including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents)  and  supporting  data  of  the  Molina  Plan  for  purposes  of  their  review  of  the  Income  Statement  and  (B) reasonably cooperate with all reasonable written requests of Seller and its Representatives in connection  with  such  review,  including  by  providing  all  readily  available  relevant  information  in  connection  with  Seller&#8217;s  review  of  the  Income  Statement  as  is  reasonably  requested  in  writing  by  Seller  or  its  Representatives.  The Income Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller shall be final, binding and conclusive  unless Seller delivers written notice to Buyer prior to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the last day of the Review  Period  that  it  objects  to any  item  or items shown  or reflected  in  the  Income  Statement (an &#8220;Objection  Notice&#8221;), which Objection Notice shall identify the specific items and calculations that Seller disagrees  with and specifies in reasonable detail Seller&#8217;s calculation of such amount and Seller&#8217;s grounds for such  disagreement. The Income Statement of Buyer shall be final, binding and conclusive as to all items and  calculations that Seller does not timely disagree with pursuant to this Section 1.7(c)(ii).                           (iii) If an Objection Notice shall be duly delivered, Buyer and Seller  shall, during the thirty (30) days following such delivery, use their good faith efforts to reach agreement on  the disputed items or amounts. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement during such period,  they shall within thirty (30) days cause a neutral independent accounting firm of national renown mutually  agreed  upon  by  the  Parties  (the  &#8220;Independent  Accountant&#8221;)  promptly  to  review  the  disputed  items  or  amounts. The Independent Accountant shall make its determination based exclusively on presentations and  supporting material provided by Buyer and Seller promptly following the engagement of the Independent  Accountant  and  not  pursuant  to  any  independent  review.  Conclusions  shall  be  determined  by  the  Independent Accountant within thirty (30) days following delivery of the last brief timely submitted and  shall  be  final,  binding  and  conclusive  as  to  such  matters;  provided,  however,  that  the  Independent  Accountant shall select either the position of Buyer or Seller (as contained in the supporting brief) as a  resolution for each item or amount disputed and may not impose an alternative resolution with respect to  any item or amount disputed and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms and provisions of  this Agreement. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between  Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the  aggregate dollar value of the items set forth in the Objection Notice not awarded to Buyer and Seller bears  to the amount actually contested by such Party. For example, if Seller claims that the aggregate appropriate  adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Independent Accountant  ultimately resolves such items by awarding to Seller $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and  expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 &divide; 1,000) to Buyer and 70% (i.e.,  700 &divide;  1,000)  to  Seller.  Buyer  and  Seller  agree  that  they  will  cooperate  and  assist  the  Independent  Accountant in the preparation of the Income Statement, the calculation of Operating Income and in the  conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in this Section 1.7(c)(iii), including the making available to  the extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.                           (iv)  Following  the  final  determination  of  Operating  Income,  in  the  event Operating Income is less than Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000), Seller  shall promptly pay to Buyer an amount equal to such deficiency by wire transfer of immediately available  funds to an account(s) designated by Buyer.  If Operating Income is equal to or greater than Seven Million  Five  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($7,500,000),  then  there  will  be  no  payment  due  under  this  Section  1.7(c)(iv).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be required to make any payment under this  Section 1.7(c)(iv) prior to August 31, 2021.                                         -7-                                            </FONT></DIV><P><HR noshade><P>

Section 9.9 Execution  of  Agreement;  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may  be  executed  in  one  or  more  counterparts,  each  of  which  will  be  deemed  to  be  an  original  copy  of  this  Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same agreement.   The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by facsimile, or by .pdf or similar imaging  transmission, will constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may  be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes.  Signatures of the Parties transmitted by facsimile,  or by .pdf or similar imaging transmission, will be deemed to be their original signatures for any purpose  whatsoever.

Accordingly, each Party agrees that, in addition to any other right or  remedy to which each Party may be entitled, at law or in equity, each Party will be entitled to enforce any  provision  of  this  Agreement  by  a  decree  of  specific  performance  and  to  temporary,  preliminary  and  permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of this Agreement,  without posting any bond or other undertaking.               Section 9.11 Guarantee.                     (a)   Evolent hereby guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and not merely as a  guaranty of collection, to Buyer the full and prompt payment when due of all obligations and liabilities of  Seller  under  and  in  accordance  with  the  terms  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  (the  &#8220;Seller  Guaranteed  Obligations&#8221;).   The  obligation  of  Evolent  under  this  Section  9.11(a)  is  an  absolute,  unconditional  and  continuing guaranty of payment of the Seller Guaranteed Obligations and shall survive the Closing and  continue to be in full force and be binding upon Evolent until the Seller Guaranteed Obligations, including  any payments to be made in connection with a Successful Protest Unwind, have been paid in full.  Evolent  agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening from  time  to  time  of  any  of  the  following  events,  whether  or  not  with  notice  or  consent  of  Evolent  (i)  the  compromise, settlement, release, change, modification or amendment of any or all of the obligations, duties,  covenants or agreements of any party under this Agreement or (ii) the extension of the time for performance  or payment of money pursuant to this Agreement, or of the time for performance of any other obligations,  covenants or agreements under or arising out of this Agreement.

To  the  fullest  extent  permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, Evolent waives any defense arising out of any such election  even though that election may operate, pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, to impair or extinguish  any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of Evolent against Seller.
