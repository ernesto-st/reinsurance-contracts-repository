                                   ARTICLE II

                                   THE CREDITS

        SECTION 2.01. COMMITMENTS. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender
agrees, severally and not jointly:

                (a) to make a Term Loan to Borrower on the Closing Date in a
        principal amount not to exceed its Term Loan Commitment; and

                (b) to make Revolving Loans to Borrower, at any time and from
        time to time after the Closing Date, and until the earlier of the
        Revolving Maturity Date and the termination of the Commitment of such
        Lender in accordance with the terms hereof, in an aggregate principal
        amount at any time outstanding that will not result in such Lender's
        Revolving Exposure exceeding such Lender's Revolving Commitment.

Amounts paid or prepaid in respect of Term Loans may not be reborrowed. Within
the limits set forth in clause (b) above and subject to the terms, conditions
and limitations set forth herein, Borrower may borrow, pay or prepay and
reborrow Revolving Loans.

        SECTION 2.02. LOANS.

                (a) Each Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of
        Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with their applicable
        Commitments; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make
        any Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its obligation
        to lend hereunder (it being understood, however, that no Lender shall be
        responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan
        required to be made by such other Lender). Except for Loans deemed made
        pursuant to Section 2.02(f), Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in
        an aggregate principal amount that is (i) an integral multiple of $1.0
        million and not less than $2.0 million or (ii) equal to the remaining
        available balance of the applicable Commitments.

                (b) Subject to Sections 2.11 and 2.12, each Borrowing shall be
        comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans as Borrower may
        request pursuant to Section 2.03. Each Lender may at its option make any
        Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate
        of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that, any exercise of such
        option shall not affect the obligation of Borrower to repay such Loan in
        accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Borrowings of more than one
        Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that
        Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made,
        would result in more than five Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding
        hereunder at any time. For purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having
        different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they commence on the
        same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

                (c) Except with respect to Loans made pursuant to Section
        2.02(f), each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on
        the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available
        funds to such account in New York City as the Administrative Agent may
        designate not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, and the
        Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an
        account as directed by Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request
        maintained with the



                                       32
<PAGE>

        Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date
        because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been
        met, return the amounts so received to the respective Lenders.

                (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
        from a Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
        not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of
        such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has
        made such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of
        such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.02(c), and the
        Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
        available to Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If the
        Administrative Agent shall have so made funds available, then, to the
        extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available to
        the Administrative Agent, such Lender and Borrower severally agree to
        repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
        amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such
        amount is made available to Borrower until the date such amount is
        repaid to the Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of Borrower, the
        interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such
        Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, a rate determined by the
        Administrative Agent to represent its cost of overnight or short-term
        funds (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error).
        If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such
        corresponding amount, such amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan as
        part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
        Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or
        continue, any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect
        thereto would end after the Revolving Maturity Date or the Term Loan
        Maturity Date, as applicable.

                (f) If the Issuing Bank shall not have received from Borrower
        the payment required to be made by Section 2.17(e) within the time
        specified in such section, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify the
        Administrative Agent of the LC Disbursement and the Administrative Agent
        will promptly notify each Revolving Lender of such LC Disbursement and
        its Pro Rata Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Lender shall pay by wire
        transfer of immediately available funds to the Administrative Agent on
        such date (or, if such Revolving Lender shall have received such notice
        later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any day, not later than
        11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the immediately following Business
        Day), an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of such LC
        Disbursement (it being understood that such amount shall be deemed to
        constitute an ABR Revolving Loan of such Lender, and such payment shall
        be deemed to have reduced the LC Exposure), and the Administrative Agent
        will promptly pay to the Issuing Bank amounts so received by it from the
        Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent will promptly pay to the
        Issuing Bank any amounts received by it from Borrower pursuant to
        Section 2.17(e) prior to the time that any Revolving Lender makes any
        payment pursuant to this Section 2.02(f); any such amounts received by
        the Administrative Agent thereafter will be promptly remitted by the
        Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made such
        payments and to the Issuing Bank, as their interests may appear. If any
        Revolving Lender shall not have made its Pro Rata Percentage of such LC
        Disbursement available to the Administrative Agent as provided above,
        such Lender and Borrower severally agree to pay interest on such amount,
        for each day from and including the date such amount is required to be
        paid in accordance with this Section 2.02(f) to but excluding the date
        such amount is paid, to the



                                       33
<PAGE>

        Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank at (i) in the
        case of Borrower, a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable
        to Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06(a), and (ii) in the case of
        such Lender, for the first such day, the Federal Funds Effective Rate,
        and for each day thereafter, the Alternate Base Rate.

        SECTION 2.03. BORROWING PROCEDURE. To request a Revolving Borrowing or
Term Borrowing, Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request
by telephone (promptly confirmed by telecopy) or by delivering a duly completed
Borrowing Request (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 2:00

provided that, any such notice of an ABR Revolving Borrowing to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.17(e) may be
given not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
be confirmed not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Business Day

                (a) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Revolving
        Borrowing or a Term Borrowing;

                (b) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

                (c) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

                (d) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
        Eurodollar Borrowing;

                (e) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest
        Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by
        the definition of the term "Interest Period"; provided that, until the
        Syndication Agent shall have notified Borrower that the primary
        syndication of the Commitments has been completed (which notice shall be
        given by the Syndication Agent as promptly as practicable and, in any
        event, within 60 days after the Closing Date) Borrower shall only be
        permitted to request an Interest Period of seven days); and

                (f) the location and number of Borrower's account to which funds
        are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section
        2.02.

If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested
Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period is specified with
respect to any requested Eurodollar Revolving Borrowing, then Borrower shall be
deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration. Promptly
following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03,
the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of
the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

        SECTION 2.04. EVIDENCE OF DEBT; REPAYMENT OF LOANS.

               (a) Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the
        Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender holding Term Loans,
        the principal amount of each Term Loan of such Lender as provided in
        Section 2.09; and (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the account of
        each Revolving Lender, the then unpaid principal amount of each
        Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Revolving Maturity Date.

               (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
        practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of Borrower
        to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to
        time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid
        to such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

               (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
        will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type and
        Class thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto; (ii) the
        amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and
        payable from Borrower to each Lender hereunder; and (iii) the amount of
        any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account
        of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

                (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
        Sections 2.04(b) and (c) shall be prima facie evidence of the existence
        and amounts of the obligations therein recorded (in the absence of
        manifest error); provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or
        the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein
        shall not in any manner affect the obligations of Borrower to repay the
        Loans in accordance with their terms.

                (e) Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be
        evidenced by a Note. In such event, Borrower shall prepare, execute and
        deliver to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender (or,
        if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns)
        and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the
        Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all times
        (including after assignment pursuant to Section 11.04) be represented by
        one or more Notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named
        therein (or, if such Note is a registered note, to such payee and its
        registered assigns).

        SECTION 2.05. FEES.

                (a) COMMITMENT FEE. Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender,
        through the Administrative Agent, a commitment fee (a "COMMITMENT FEE")
        equal to the Applicable Commitment Fee Percentage times the average
        daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitments of such Lender. All
        Commitment Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last
        Business Day of March, June, September and December in each year
        (commencing with the first such date to occur after the Closing Date)
        and on each date (including the Revolving Maturity Date) on which any
        Commitment of such Lender shall expire or be terminated as provided
        herein. All Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual
        number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days. The Commitment Fee due to
        each Lender shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall cease
        to accrue on the date on which the Revolving Commitment of such Lender
        shall expire or be terminated as provided herein.

                (b) ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES. Borrower agrees to pay to the
        Administrative Agent, for its own account, the administrative fees set
        forth in the Fee Letter or such other fees payable in the amounts and at
        the times separately agreed upon between Borrower and the Administrative
        Agent (the "ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES").

                (c) LC AND FRONTING FEES. Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the
        Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a
        participation fee ("LC PARTICIPATION FEE") with respect to its
        participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate equal
        to the Applicable Margin from time to time used to determine the
        interest rate on Eurodollar Revolving Loans pursuant to Section 2.06 on
        the average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any
        portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during
        the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the
        later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving Commitment terminates
        and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and
        (ii) to the Issuing Bank a fronting fee ("FRONTING FEE"), which shall
        accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum on the average daily amount of the
        LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed
        LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date
        to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving
        Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC Exposure, as
        well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance,
        amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of
        drawings thereunder. LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees accrued
        through and including the last day of March, June, September and
        December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day
        following such last day, commencing on the first such date to occur
        after the Closing Date; provided that, all such fees shall be payable on
        the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees
        accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate
        shall be payable on demand. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank
        pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) shall be payable within ten days after
        demand. All LC Participation Fees and Fronting Fees shall be computed on
        the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual
        number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last
        day).

All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the
Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as appropriate, among the Lenders,
except that the Fronting Fees shall be paid directly to the Issuing Bank. Once
paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

        SECTION 2.06. INTEREST ON LOANS.

                (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the Loans
        comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum
        equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin in effect
        from time to time.

                (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.06(c), the Loans
        comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per
        annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for the Interest Period in effect
        for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin in effect from time to
        time.

                (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence and
        during the continuation of any Event of Default, and at the election of
        the Required Lenders, the outstanding principal amount of all Loans and,
        to the extent permitted by applicable law,



                                       36

        any interest payments thereon and any fees and other amounts hereunder,
        shall thereafter bear interest (including post-petition interest in any
        proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable bankruptcy
        laws) payable upon demand at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of
        the interest rate otherwise payable under this Agreement with respect to
        the applicable Loans (or, in the case of any such fees and other
        amounts, at a rate that is 2% per annum in excess of the interest rate
        otherwise payable under this Agreement for ABR Loans); provided that, in
        the case of Eurodollar Loans, upon the expiration of the Interest Period
        in effect at the time any such increase in interest rate is effective,
        such Eurodollar Rate Loans shall thereupon become ABR Loans and shall
        thereafter bear interest payable upon demand at a rate that is 2% per
        annum in excess of the interest rate otherwise payable under this
        Agreement for ABR Loans. Payment or acceptance of the increased rates of
        interest provided for in this Section 2.06(c) is not a permitted
        alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any
        Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies
        of Administrative Agent or any Lender.

                (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
        each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving
        Loans, upon termination of the Revolving Commitments; provided that, (i)
        interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.06(c) shall be payable on demand,
        (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than
        a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving
        Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
        prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and
        (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the
        end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such
        Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

                (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
        year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the
        Alternate Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days
        (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the
        actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
        last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBOR Rate
        shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination
        shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

        SECTION 2.07. TERMINATION AND REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

                (a) The Term Loan Commitments shall automatically terminate at
        5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date. The Revolving
        Commitments and the LC Commitment shall automatically terminate on the
        Revolving Maturity Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all the
        Commitments shall automatically terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City
        time, on August 31, 2002, if the initial Credit Extension shall not have
        occurred by such time.

                (b) Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time
        reduce, the Commitments of any Class; provided that, (i) each reduction
        of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an
        integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1.0 million and (ii)
        the Revolving Commitments shall not be terminated or reduced if, after
        giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans in
        accordance with Section 2.10(b), the sum of the Revolving Exposures
        would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving Commitments.



                                       37
<PAGE>

                (c) Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
        election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under Section 2.07(b) at
        least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
        termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective
        date thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, the
        Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.
        Each notice delivered by Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.07(b) shall
        be irrevocable. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any
        Class shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments of any Class
        shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their
        respective Commitments of such Class.

        SECTION 2.08. INTEREST ELECTIONS.

                (a) Each Revolving Borrowing and Term Borrowing initially shall
        be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the
        case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as
        specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, Borrower may elect to
        convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing
        and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods
        therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.08. Borrower may elect
        different options with respect to different portions of the affected
        Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably
        among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the
        Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate
        Borrowing.

                (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.08, Borrower
        shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by
        the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03
        if Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing or Term Borrowing of
        the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date
        of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall
        be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or
        telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
        Request substantially in the form of Exhibit D.

                (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall
        specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

                        (i) The Borrowing to which such Interest Election
                Request applies and, if different options are being elected with
                respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to
                be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the
                information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv)
                below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

                        (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to
                such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                        (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
                Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

                        (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar
                Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
                giving effect to such election, which shall be a period
                contemplated by the definition of the



                                       38
<PAGE>

                term "Interest Period"; provided that, until the Syndication
                Agent shall have notified Borrower that the primary syndication
                of the Commitments has been completed (which notice shall be
                given by the Syndication Agent as promptly as practicable and,
                in any event, within 60 days after the Closing Date), Borrower
                shall only be permitted to request an Interest Period of seven
                days.

        If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing
        but does not specify an Interest Period, then (except in the case of
        clause (iv) above) Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest
        Period of one month's duration.

                (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request,
        the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof
        and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                (e) If an Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar
        Borrowing is not timely delivered prior to the end of the Interest
        Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as
        provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall
        be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
        hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the
        Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so
        notifies Borrower, then, after the occurrence and during the continuance
        of a Default, (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or
        continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each
        Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end
        of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

        SECTION 2.09. AMORTIZATION OF TERM BORROWINGS.

                (a) Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
        account of the Term Lenders, on the dates set forth on Annex I, or if
        any such date is not a Business Day, on the next preceding Business Day
        (each such date being a "TERM LOAN REPAYMENT DATE"), a principal amount
        of the Term Loans (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
        Sections 2.09(b) and 2.10) equal to the amount set forth on Annex I for
        such date (less all mandatory and optional prepayments made thereon),
        together in each case with accrued and unpaid interest on the principal
        amount to be paid to but excluding the date of such payment.

                (b) To the extent not previously paid, all Term Loans shall be
        due and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

        SECTION 2.10. OPTIONAL AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF LOANS.

                (a) OPTIONAL PREPAYMENTS. Borrower shall have the right at any
        time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing, in whole or in part,
        subject to the requirements of this Section 2.10; provided that, each
        partial prepayment shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of
        $500,000 and not less than $1.0 million.

                (b) REVOLVING LOAN PREPAYMENTS. In the event of any termination
        of all the Revolving Commitments, Borrower shall, on the date of such
        termination, repay or prepay all its outstanding Revolving Borrowings
        and replace all outstanding Letters of Credit and/or deposit an amount
        equal to the LC Exposure in the LC Sub-Account. In the



                                       39
<PAGE>

        event of any partial reduction of the Revolving Commitments, (i) at or
        prior to the effective date of such reduction, the Administrative Agent
        shall notify Borrower and the Revolving Lenders of the sum of the
        Revolving Exposures after giving effect thereto and (ii) if the sum of
        the Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate amount of Revolving
        Commitments after giving effect to such reduction or termination, then
        Borrower shall, on the date of such reduction or termination, repay or
        prepay Revolving Borrowings and/or replace or cash collateralize
        outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient to eliminate such
        excess.

                (c) ASSET SALES. Not later than five Business Days following the
        receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale (in the case of Asset
        Sales by non-U.S. parties, to the extent such amounts can be repatriated
        to the United States without materially adverse economic consequences
        taking into account the amount of proceeds received from such Asset Sale
        as determined by the Administrative Agent (after consultation with
        Borrower)), Borrower shall apply 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds received
        with respect thereto to make prepayments in accordance with Sections
        2.10(h) and (i); provided that:

                        (i) no such prepayment shall be required with respect to
                (A) any Asset Sale permitted by Section 6.04(b)(i), (d) or (f),
                (B) the disposition of assets subject to a condemnation or
                eminent domain proceeding or insurance settlement to the extent
                it does not constitute a Casualty Event, and (C) Asset Sales for
                fair market value resulting in no more than $2.5 million in Net
                Cash Proceeds in any fiscal year; and

                        (ii) so long as no Default shall then exist or would
                arise therefrom, no such prepayment shall be required to the
                extent that (A) Borrower shall have delivered an Officer's
                Certificate to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such date
                stating that the Net Cash Proceeds of such Asset Sale will be
                used to purchase replacement assets or other assets useful in
                such Person's business within 270 days of such Asset Sale and
                setting forth estimates of the proceeds to be so expended, and
                (B) all such Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $2.5 million
                individually and $5.0 million in the aggregate in any fiscal
                year of Borrower shall be held in the Collateral Account and
                released therefrom only in accordance with the provisions of
                Article IX; provided, however, that if any portion of such Net
                Cash Proceeds are not reinvested in accordance with this clause
                (ii), such unused portion shall be applied on the last day of
                such period as a mandatory prepayment of principal of
                outstanding Term Loans as provided in this Section 2.10(c).

                (d) DEBT ISSUANCE. Upon any Debt Issuance after the Closing
        Date, Borrower shall make prepayments in accordance with Sections
        2.10(h) and (i) in an aggregate principal amount equal to 100% of the
        Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance.

                (e) EQUITY ISSUANCE. Upon any Equity Issuance after the Closing
        Date (other than in connection with the Equity Financing), Borrower
        shall make prepayments in accordance with Sections 2.10(h) and (i) in an
        aggregate principal amount equal to 50% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such
        Equity Issuance.

                (f) CASUALTY EVENTS. Not later than one Business Day following
        the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from a Casualty Event, Borrower
        shall make prepayments in



                                       40
<PAGE>

        accordance with Sections 2.10(h) and (i) in an amount equal to 100% of
        such Net Cash Proceeds; provided, however, that:

                        (i) so long as no Default or Event of Default then
                exists or would arise therefrom, the Net Cash Proceeds thereof
                shall not be required to be so applied on such date to the
                extent that Borrower has delivered an Officers' Certificate to
                the Collateral Agent on or prior to such date stating that such
                proceeds shall be used to fund the acquisition of property used
                or usable in the business of Borrower and its Subsidiaries or
                repair, replace or restore the property in accordance with the
                provisions of the applicable Security Document in respect of
                which such Casualty Event has occurred, in each case within 270
                days following the date of the receipt of such Net Cash
                Proceeds;

                        (ii) to the extent such Casualty Event affects any of
                the Collateral, all property acquired to effect any repair,
                replacement or restoration of such Collateral shall be made
                subject to the Lien of the Security Documents in accordance with
                the provisions of Section 5.11;

                        (iii) all such Net Cash Proceeds in excess of $1.0
                million individually or in the aggregate for all such Casualty
                Events shall be held in the Collateral Account and released
                therefrom only in accordance with the terms of Article IX;

                        (iv) if all or any portion of such Net Cash Proceeds
                shall not be so applied within such 270-day period, such unused
                portion shall be applied on the last day of such period as a
                mandatory prepayment as provided in this Section 2.10(f); and

                        (v) no such prepayment shall be required with respect to
                Casualty Events resulting in no more than $1.0 million in Net
                Cash Proceeds in any fiscal year.

                (g) EXCESS CASH FLOW. No later than 120 days after the end of
        each fiscal year of Borrower, commencing with the fiscal year ending on
        December 31, 2002, Borrower shall make prepayments in accordance with
        Section 2.10(h)(ii), Section 2.10(i) and Section 2.10(j) in an aggregate
        principal amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for the fiscal year
        then ended.

                (h) APPLICATION OF PREPAYMENTS.

                        (i) Optional prepayments under this Agreement shall be
                applied as specified by Borrower in the applicable notice of
                prepayment in Section 2.10(i); provided that, in the event
                Borrower fails to specify the Loans to which any such prepayment
                shall be applied, such prepayment shall be applied first to
                repay outstanding Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof,
                and second to repay outstanding Term Loans to the full extent
                thereof. Mandatory prepayments under this Agreement shall be
                applied first to reduce outstanding Term Loans pro rata against
                the remaining scheduled installments of principal due in respect
                of the Term Loans under Section 2.09. After application of
                mandatory



                                       41
<PAGE>

                prepayments pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence and
                to the extent there are mandatory prepayment amounts remaining
                after such application, any such remaining portion of the
                mandatory prepayment amounts shall be applied (i) to prepay the
                Revolving Loans to the full extent thereof and to further
                permanently reduce the Revolving Commitments ratably among the
                Revolving Lenders by the amount of such prepayment (and Borrower
                shall comply with Section 2.10(b)), and (ii) then, to the extent
                of any remaining portion of the mandatory prepayment amounts, to
                further permanently reduce the Revolving Commitments ratably
                among the Revolving Lenders to the full extent thereof.

                        (ii) Amounts to be applied pursuant to this Section 2.10
                to the prepayment of Term Loans and Revolving Loans shall be
                applied, as applicable, first to reduce outstanding ABR Term
                Loans and ABR Revolving Loans, respectively. Any amounts
                remaining after each such application shall be applied to prepay
                Eurodollar Term Loans or Eurodollar Revolving Loans, as
                applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of any
                prepayment of Loans required under this Section 2.10 shall be in
                excess of the amount of the ABR Loans at the time outstanding,
                only the portion of the amount of such prepayment as is equal to
                the amount of such outstanding ABR Loans shall be immediately
                prepaid and, at the election of Borrower, the balance of such
                required prepayment shall be either (x) deposited in the
                Collateral Account and applied to the prepayment of Eurodollar
                Loans on the last day of the then next-expiring Interest Period
                for Eurodollar Loans (with all interest accruing thereon for the
                account of Borrower) or (y) prepaid immediately, together with
                any amounts owing to the Lenders under Section 2.13.
                Notwithstanding any such deposit in the Collateral Account,
                interest shall continue to accrue on such Loans until
                prepayment.

                (i) NOTICE OF PREPAYMENT. Borrower shall notify the
        Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any
        prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar
        Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business
        Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an
        ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one
        Business Day before the date of prepayment, and (iii) in the case of any
        mandatory prepayment under Section 2.10(g), not later than 11:00 a.m.,
        New York City time, ten Business Days before the date of prepayment.
        Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment
        date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be
        prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably
        detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly
        following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall
        advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of
        any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case
        of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section
        2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a
        mandatory prepayment. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied
        ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments
        shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by
        Section 2.06.

                (j) WAIVABLE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT. Notwithstanding the other
        provisions of this Section 2.10, if Borrower is required to make any
        mandatory prepayment under Section 2.10(g), then promptly after
        receiving notice thereof from Borrower in accordance with Section
        2.10(i), the Administrative Agent will notify each Term Lender holding
        outstanding Term Loans of the amount of such Term Lender's ratable share
        of such prepayment to be applied toward reducing such Term Lender's
        outstanding Term Loans, and such Term Lender's option to refuse such
        amount. Each such Term Lender may exercise its option to refuse such
        amount by giving written notice thereof (which may be by telecopy) to
        Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or before 11:00 a.m., New York
        City time, five Business Days before the date of such prepayment (it
        being understood that any Term Lender that does not so notify Borrower
        and the Administrative Agent within such time will be deemed to have
        elected, as of such date, not to exercise such option). That portion of
        such mandatory prepayment creditable to the Term Lenders that have
        elected not to refuse their ratable shares in accordance with this
        Section 2.10(j) shall be ratably applied to reduce such Term Lenders'
        principal amounts outstanding in accordance with Section 2.10(h). To the
        extent there are mandatory prepayment amounts remaining after the
        application described above in this Section 2.10(j), then the
        Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the
        amount of such Revolving Lender's ratable share of such prepayment to be
        applied toward reducing such Revolving Lender's outstanding Revolving
        Loans and permanently reducing such Revolving Lender Revolving
        Commitments, and such Revolving Lender's option to refuse such amount.
        Each such Revolving Lender may exercise its option to refuse such amount
        by giving written notice thereof (which may be by telecopy) to Borrower
        and the Administrative Agent on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City
        time, one Business Day before the date of such prepayment (it being
        understood that any Revolving Lender that does not so notify Borrower
        and the Administrative Agent within such time will be deemed to have
        elected, as of such date, not to exercise such option). That portion of
        such mandatory prepayment creditable to the Revolving Lenders that have
        elected not to refuse their ratable shares in accordance with this
        Section 2.10(j) shall be ratably applied to reduce such Revolving
        Lenders' principal amounts outstanding and to further permanently reduce
        such Revolving Lenders' Revolving Commitments by the amount of such
        prepayment and then, to the extent of any remaining portion of the
        mandatory prepayment amounts, to further permanently reduce such
        Revolving Lenders' Revolving Commitments to the full extent thereof, all
        in accordance with Section 2.10(h). That portion of such mandatory
        prepayment creditable to the Term Lenders and Revolving Lenders that
        have elected to refuse their ratable shares in accordance with this
        Section 2.10(j) shall be, if not already paid hereunder, retained by
        Borrower, or if already paid hereunder, promptly credited to an account
        maintained with the Administrative Agent as directed by Borrower.

        SECTION 2.11. ALTERNATE RATE OF INTEREST. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

                (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
        shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable
        means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such
        Interest Period; or

                (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
        that the Adjusted LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period will not
        adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or
        maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest
        Period;



                                       43
<PAGE>

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

        SECTION 2.12. INCREASED COSTS.

                (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                        (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve,
                special deposit or similar requirement against assets of,
                deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any
                Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the
                Adjusted LIBOR Rate) or the Issuing Bank; or

                        (ii) impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the
                London interbank market any other condition affecting this
                Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter
                of Credit or participation therein;

        and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to
        such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of
        maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the
        cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or
        maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum
        received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder
        (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then Borrower will pay to
        such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional
        amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
        the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction
        suffered.

                (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change
        in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
        reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
        capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding
        company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made
        by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the
        Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that
        which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing
        Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law
        (taking into consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies
        and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
        with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time Borrower will
        pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such
        additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the
        Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company for
        any such reduction suffered.

                (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth
        the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing
        Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in Section
        2.12(a) or (b) shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive
        absent manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing
        Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
        certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.



                                       44
<PAGE>

                (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing
        Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall not
        constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to
        demand such compensation; provided that, Borrower shall not be required
        to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.12
        for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior
        to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
        notifies Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
        costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention
        to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in
        Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
        then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include
        the period of retroactive effect thereof.

        SECTION 2.13. BREAKAGE PAYMENTS. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b)
the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or
prepay any Revolving Loan or Term Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other
than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16, then, in any such event, Borrower
shall compensate each Lender for the reasonable loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or
expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBOR Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at
the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement
of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other
banks in the Eurodollar market. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section 2.13 shall be delivered to Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any
such certificate within ten days after receipt thereof.

        SECTION 2.14. PAYMENTS GENERALLY; PRO RATA TREATMENT; SHARING OF
SET-OFFS.

                (a) Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
        hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal,
        interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts
        payable under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15, or otherwise) on or before the
        time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for
        such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 2:00
        p.m., New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately
        available funds, without set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received
        after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative
        Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business
        Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments
        shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 677
        Washington Boulevard, Stamford, Connecticut, except payments to be made
        directly to the Issuing Bank as expressly provided herein and except
        that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15 and 11.03 shall be
        made directly to the persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to
        other Loan Documents shall be made to the persons specified therein. The
        Administrative Agent



                                       45
<PAGE>

        shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any
        other person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt
        thereof. If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day
        that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to
        the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment
        accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
        such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in
        dollars.

                (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
        available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of
        principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due
        hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first towards payment of
        interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
        thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to
        such parties, and (ii) second towards payment of principal and
        unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the
        parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and
        unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
        counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of
        or interest on any of its Revolving Loans, Term Loans or participations
        in LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
        greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans, Term
        Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and accrued interest
        thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the
        Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
        face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, Term Loans and
        participations in LC Disbursements of the other Lenders to the extent
        necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by
        the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal
        of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans, Term Loans
        and participations in LC Disbursements; provided that, (i) if any such
        participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
        giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
        and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
        interest, and (ii) the provisions of this Section 2.14(c) shall not be
        construed to apply to any payment made by Borrower pursuant to and in
        accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment
        obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment or sale of a
        participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements
        to any assignee or participant, other than to Borrower or any Subsidiary
        or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 2.14(c)
        shall apply). Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
        extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender
        acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may
        exercise against Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with
        respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
        creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
        from Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
        Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank
        hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
        Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment on such date in
        accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
        distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the
        amount due. In such event, if Borrower has not in fact made such
        payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
        be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith



                                       46
<PAGE>

        on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with
        interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount
        is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
        Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
        and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with
        banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

                (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be
        made by it pursuant to Section 2.02(f), 2.14(d), 2.17(d) or 11.03(d),
        then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
        any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by
        the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such
        Lender's obligations under such sections until all such unsatisfied
        obligations are fully paid.

        SECTION 2.15. TAXES.

                (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
        Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made
        without set-off, counterclaim or other defense and free and clear of and
        without deduction or withholding for any and all Indemnified Taxes or
        Other Taxes; provided that, if Borrower shall be required by law to
        deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i)
        the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
        required deductions or withholdings (including deductions or
        withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section
        2.15) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may
        be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
        such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) Borrower shall make such
        deductions or withholdings and (iii) Borrower shall pay the full amount
        deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in
        accordance with applicable law.

                (b) In addition, Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
        relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                (c) Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each
        Lender and the Issuing Bank, within ten Business Days after written
        demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
        Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
        as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account
        of any obligation of Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document
        (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
        attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) and any
        penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
        respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
        were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
        Governmental Authority. If in the reasonable opinion of Borrower, any
        amount has been paid to, by or on behalf of the Administrative Agent,
        any Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) pursuant to clause
        (a), (b) or this (c) of this Section 2.15 with respect to Taxes or Other
        Taxes which are not correctly or legally asserted, the Administrative
        Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank (as the case may be) will
        cooperate with Borrower in seeking to obtain a refund for the benefit of
        Borrower of such amount, provided that, the rendering of any such
        cooperation by the Administrative Agent, such Lender, or the Issuing
        Bank, would not, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent,
        such Lender, or the Issuing Bank, (i) cause the Administrative Agent,
        such Lender, or the Issuing Bank, to incur any expense or liability
        (which is not otherwise paid in full by Borrower prior to or at the time
        that such expense or liability is incurred) or (ii)



                                       47
<PAGE>

        have any adverse effect on the Administrative Agent, such Lender, or the
        Issuing Bank. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
        liability delivered to Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by
        the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or
        the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. If the
        Administrative Agent, any Lender, or the Issuing Bank receives a written
        notice of Tax assessment from any Governmental Authority regarding any
        Tax in respect of which indemnification may be required pursuant to this
        Section 2.15(c), the Administrative Agent, such Lender, or the Issuing
        Bank, as the case may be, shall notify Borrower within 120 days
        following the receipt of such notice that such notice has been received;
        provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent, such
        Lender, or the Issuing Bank to provide such notice shall not relieve
        Borrower of its obligation to make any indemnification payment under
        this Agreement.

                (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
        Taxes or Other Taxes by Borrower to a Governmental Authority, Borrower
        shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
        copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such
        payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence
        of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                (e) On or before the Closing Date in the case of the
        Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank, or on or before
        the acceptance of any appointment as the Administrative Agent in the
        case of a successor Agent, or on or before the effective date of an
        Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to which it became a Lender in the
        case of an assignee, or on or prior to the date that any Lender becomes
        an Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.17(i), and if otherwise reasonably
        requested from time to time by Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
        within 30 days of such request, the Administrative Agent, each Lender or
        the Issuing Bank which is not a U.S. Person within the meaning of
        Section 7701(a)(30) of the Tax Code shall provide to each of the
        Administrative Agent and Borrower two duly completed and signed copies
        of Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, or W-8ECI or successor
        form(s), as the case may be, certifying as to such Administrative
        Agent's, Lender's or Issuing Bank's (if applicable) status for purposes
        of determining exemption from United States withholding taxes with
        respect to all payments to be made to the Administrative Agent, each
        Lender or the Issuing Bank under this Agreement. Until Borrower and the
        Administrative Agent have received such forms and indicating that
        payments under this Agreement are subject to an exemption from or
        reduction of United States withholding tax, Borrower or the
        Administrative Agent (if not withheld by Borrower) shall withhold taxes
        from such payments at the applicable statutory rate, without any
        obligation to "gross-up" or make the Administrative Agent, such Lender
        or Issuing Bank whole under clause (a) of this Section. In the case of
        an Administrative Agent, Lender, or Issuing Bank that is subject to a
        reduction of, rather than exemption from, United States withholding tax,
        the obligation of Borrower to "gross-up" under clause (a) of this
        Section shall not apply in respect of the amount of United States
        withholding tax that the Administrative Agent, such Lender, or the
        Issuing Bank is subject to at the time they become a party to this
        Agreement (provided, however, that in the case of an assignee that
        becomes a Lender pursuant to Section 11.04, the obligation of Borrower
        to "gross-up" under clause (a) of this Section, or indemnify for
        Indemnified Taxes under clause (c) of this Section, shall apply in
        respect of the amount of United States withholding tax that is
        applicable to payments made on or after the date upon which the assignee
        first becomes a Lender to the same extent that Borrower would have been
        obligated to "gross-up" under clause (a) of this Section, or indemnify
        for



                                       48
<PAGE>

        Indemnified Taxes under clause (c) of this Section, had the
        Administrative Agent, relevant Lender, or the Issuing Bank, as the case
        may be, not made such assignment to such assignee).

                (f) If (i) the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or the Issuing
        Bank receives a cash refund in respect of an overpayment of Indemnified
        Taxes or Other Taxes from a Governmental Authority with respect to, and
        actually resulting from, an amount of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
        actually paid to or on behalf of the Administrative Agent, such Lender,
        or Issuing Bank by Borrower (a "TAX REFUND") and (ii) the Administrative
        Agent, such Lender, or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, determines
        in its reasonable opinion that such Tax Refund has been correctly paid
        by such Governmental Authority and will not be required to be repaid to
        such Governmental Authority, then the Administrative Agent, such Lender,
        or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall use its reasonable
        efforts to notify Borrower of such Tax Refund and to forward the
        proceeds of such Tax Refund (or relevant portion thereof) to Borrower as
        reduced by any expense or liability incurred by the Administrative
        Agent, such Lender, or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, in
        connection with obtaining such Tax Refund.

        SECTION 2.16. MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

                (a) MITIGATION OF OBLIGATIONS. If any Lender requests
        compensation under Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any
        additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
        account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall
        use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
        funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and
        obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates,
        if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
        assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
        Section 2.12 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would
        not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would
        not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. Borrower hereby agrees
        to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
        connection with any such designation or assignment.

                (b) REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If any Lender requests compensation
        under Section 2.12, or if Borrower is required to pay any additional
        amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of
        any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, or if any Lender defaults in its
        obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then Borrower may, at its sole
        expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
        Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
        accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section
        11.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this
        Agreement to an assignee selected by Borrower that shall assume such
        obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts
        such assignment); provided that, (i) Borrower shall have received the
        prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and, if a Revolving
        Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank), which consent shall not
        unreasonably be withheld; (ii) such Lender shall have received payment
        of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
        participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued
        fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee
        (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and
        fees) or Borrower (in the case of all other amounts); and (iii) in the
        case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
        under Section 2.12 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section
        2.15, such assignment will result in a material reduction in such
        compensation or payments. A



                                       49
<PAGE>

        Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation
        if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,
        the circumstances entitling Borrower to require such assignment and
        delegation cease to apply.

        SECTION 2.17. LETTERS OF CREDIT.

                (a) GENERAL. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
        herein, Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its
        own account or the account of a Subsidiary in a form reasonably
        acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank, at any time
        and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period (provided
        that, Borrower shall be a co-applicant with respect to each Letter of
        Credit issued for the account of or in favor of a Subsidiary). In the
        event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter-of-credit
        application or other agreement submitted by Borrower to, or entered into
        by Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the
        terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                (b) NOTICE OF ISSUANCE, AMENDMENT, RENEWAL, EXTENSION; CERTAIN
        CONDITIONS. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
        amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit),
        Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
        communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the
        Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least
        three Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance,
        amendment, renewal or extension, or such shorter period as is acceptable
        to such respective Issuing Bank) a duly completed Letter of Credit
        Request, together with such other information as shall be necessary to
        prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by
        the Issuing Bank, Borrower also shall submit a letter-of-credit
        application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any
        request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued,
        amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance, amendment,
        renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be deemed
        to represent and warrant that) after giving effect to such issuance,
        amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed
        $10.0 million, (ii) the total Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the
        total Revolving Commitments, (iii) the stated amount of each Letter of
        Credit shall be no less than $500,000, or such lesser amount as is
        acceptable to the Issuing Bank, and (iv) each Letter of Credit shall be
        denominated in dollars.

                (c) EXPIRATION DATE. Each Letter of Credit shall expire no later
        than the close of business on the earlier of (i) in the case of a
        Standby Letter of Credit, (x) the date one year after the date of the
        issuance of such Standby Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any
        renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension)
        and (y) the date that is 15 Business Days prior to the Revolving
        Maturity Date and (ii) in the case of a Commercial Letter of Credit, (x)
        the date that is 180 days after the date of issuance of such Commercial
        Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof,
        one year after such renewal or extension) and (y) the date that is 15
        Business Days prior to the Revolving Maturity Date.

                (d) PARTICIPATIONS. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an
        amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
        without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the
        Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and
        each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a



                                       50
<PAGE>

        participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender's Pro Rata
        Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such
        Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing,
        each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to
        pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank,
        such Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the
        Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrower on the date due as provided
        in Section 2.17(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be
        refunded to Borrower for any reason. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees
        that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this Section
        2.17(d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
        and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any
        amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the
        occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of
        the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any
        offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

                (e) REIMBURSEMENT. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
        Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall reimburse
        such LC Disbursement by paying to the Issuing Bank an amount equal to
        such LC Disbursement not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on
        the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if Borrower shall have
        received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 11:00 a.m., New York
        City time on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by
        Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 2:00 p.m.,
        New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that Borrower receives such
        notice, if such notice is received prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City
        time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately
        following the day that Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is
        not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; provided that,
        Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein,
        request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed
        with an ABR Revolving Borrowing in an equivalent amount and, to the
        extent so financed, Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be
        discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing. If
        Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Issuing Bank shall
        notify the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall
        notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the
        payment then due from Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Pro
        Rata Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each
        Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Pro Rata
        Percentage of the unreimbursed LC Disbursement in the same manner as
        provided in Section 2.02(f), with respect to Loans made by such Lender,
        and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the
        amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following
        receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from Borrower
        pursuant to this Section 2.17(e), the Administrative Agent shall, to the
        extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this
        Section 2.17(e) to reimburse the Issuing Bank, distribute such payment
        to such Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any
        payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17(e) to
        reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the
        funding of ABR Revolving Loans as contemplated above) shall not
        constitute a Loan and shall not relieve Borrower of its obligation to
        reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                (f) OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. The obligation of Borrower to
        reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in Section 2.17(e) shall be
        absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly
        in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
        circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
        enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or



                                       51
<PAGE>

        provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a
        Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any
        respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
        respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit
        against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply
        with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or
        circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing,
        that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.17(f), constitute a
        legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of set-off against,
        the obligations of Borrower hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent,
        the Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Affiliates, shall
        have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with
        the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or
        failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the
        circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error,
        omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any
        draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of
        Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder),
        any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence
        arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided
        that, the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank
        from liability to Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as
        opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby
        waived by Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered
        by Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise
        care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under
        a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto
        expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful
        misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a
        court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to
        have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the
        foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree
        that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to
        be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the
        Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment
        upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation,
        regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to
        accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in
        strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

                (g) DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES. The Issuing Bank shall, promptly
        following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
        represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing
        Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and Borrower by
        telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether
        the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
        provided that, any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall
        not relieve Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and
        the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement (other
        than with respect to the timing of such reimbursement obligation set
        forth in Section 2.17(e)).

                (h) INTERIM INTEREST. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
        Disbursement, then, unless Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
        in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount
        thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date
        such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that Borrower
        reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable
        to ABR Revolving Loans; provided that, if Borrower fails to reimburse
        such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.17(e), then Section
        2.06(c) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this Section 2.17(h)
        shall be for the account of the Issuing



                                       52


<PAGE>

        Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by
        any Revolving Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(e) to reimburse the
        Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of
        such payment.

                (i) RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF THE ISSUING BANK; ADDITIONAL
        ISSUING BANKS. The Issuing Bank may resign as Issuing Bank or be
        replaced at any time by written agreement among Borrower, the
        Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor
        Issuing Bank. Borrower may, at any time and from time to time with the
        consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be
        unreasonably withheld) and such Lender, by written agreement designate
        one or more additional Lenders to act as an issuing bank under the terms
        of this Agreement. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of
        any such replacement of the Issuing Bank or any such additional Issuing
        Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, Borrower
        shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
        Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.05(c). From and after the effective
        date of any such replacement or addition, as applicable, (i) the
        successor or additional Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and
        obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
        Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter by such Lender, and (ii)
        references herein and in the other Loan Documents to the term "Issuing
        Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or such addition to any
        previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor or such addition and all
        previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the
        replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank
        shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights
        and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
        Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not
        be required to issue additional Letters of Credit. If at any time there
        is more than one Issuing Bank hereunder, Borrower may, in its
        discretion, select which Issuing Bank is to issue any particular Letter
        of Credit.

                (j) CASH COLLATERALIZATION. If any Event of Default shall occur
        and be continuing, on the Business Day that Borrower receives notice
        from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the
        maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC
        Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure)
        demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this Section
        2.17(j), Borrower shall deposit in the LC Sub-Account, in the name of
        the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in
        cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and
        unpaid interest thereon; provided that, the obligation to deposit such
        cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit
        shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice
        of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to
        Borrower described in paragraph (g) or (h) of Article VIII. Each such
        deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the
        payment and performance of the obligations of Borrower under this
        Agreement. The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
        control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account.
        Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which
        investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the
        Collateral Agent and at the risk and expense of Borrower, such deposits
        shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such
        investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account
        shall be invested in Cash Equivalents and applied by the Collateral
        Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it
        has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held
        for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of Borrower for
        the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been
        accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving



                                       53
<PAGE>

        Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC
        Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Obligations of Borrower under
        this Agreement. If Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash
        collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of
        Default, such amount plus any accrued interest or realized profits or
        such amounts (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned
        to Borrower within three Business Days after all Events of Default have
        been cured or waived.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

        Each of the Loan Parties, as applicable, represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and each of the
Lenders (with references to the Companies being references thereto after giving
effect to the Transactions unless otherwise expressly stated) that:

and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (b)
has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as now conducted,

        SECTION 3.02. AUTHORIZATION; ENFORCEABILITY. The Transactions to be
entered into by each Loan Party are within such Loan Party's powers and have
been duly authorized by all necessary action. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each Loan Party and constitutes, and each other Loan

such Loan Party, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and subject to general principles of equity,
regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

imposition of any Lien on any asset of any Company, except Liens created under
the Loan Documents and Permitted Liens.

        SECTION 3.04. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Deloitte & Touche LLP are
independent accountants within the meaning of Regulation S-X of the Securities
Act. The historical financial statements and the notes thereto included in the
Offering Memorandum present fairly in all material respects the consolidated
financial position, income statement, cash flows and changes in stockholder's
equity of Borrower and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates and for the
respective periods indicated. All such financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
presented (except as disclosed therein). The unaudited pro forma financial
statements and the notes thereto included in the Offering Memorandum have been
prepared on a basis consistent with the historical financial statements of
Borrower and its Subsidiaries and give effect to assumptions used in the
preparation thereof on a reasonable basis and in good faith and present fairly
in all material respects the historical and proposed transactions contemplated
by the Offering Memorandum; and such pro forma financial statements comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements applicable to pro forma
financial statements set forth in Regulation S-X under the Securities Act,
except that Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act does not
require the inclusion of pro forma financial statements for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2002. The other financial and statistical information and data
included in the Offering Memorandum (other than industry and market-related
data) are accurately presented in all material respects and prepared on a basis
consistent with the financial statements and the books and records of Borrower
and its Subsidiaries.

        SECTION 3.05. PROPERTIES.

                (a) Each Loan Party has good title to, or valid leasehold
        interests in or other valid rights to use, all of such Company's Real
        Property, and all of such Loan Party's personal property material to its
        business. Title to all such property held by such Loan Party is free and
        clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens. The property of the
        Companies, taken as a whole, (i) is in good operating order, condition
        and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) (except to the extent such
        condition could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect) and (ii) constitutes all the properties that are
        required for the business and operations of the Companies as currently
        conducted.

                (b) For each Loan Party, Schedule 3.05(b) contains a true and
        complete list of each parcel of Real Property (i) owned by such Loan
        Party as of the Closing Date, including a description of the type of
        interest therein held by such Loan Party, and the name of the Loan Party
        holding such interest; or (ii) leased, subleased or otherwise occupied
        or utilized by any Loan Party, as lessee or sublessee, as of the Closing
        Date, including a description of the type of interest therein held by
        such Loan Party, the name of the Loan Party holding such interest, and
        whether such lease, sublease or other instrument (each, a "COMPANY
        LEASE") requires the consent of the landlord thereunder or other parties
        thereto to the Transactions. Each Company Lease is a legal, valid and
        binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms, of the Loan
        Party that is a party thereto, and there is no, nor has any Loan Party
        received notice of any, default thereunder (or to the knowledge of any
        Loan Party, any condition or event that, after notice or a lapse of time
        or both, would constitute a default thereunder). No Loan Party, and, to
        the knowledge of each Loan Party, no third party to any Company Lease,
        has assigned any Company Lease or sublet any part of the premises
        covered thereby or



                                       55
<PAGE>

        exercised any renewal or purchase option thereunder. No penalties are
        accrued and unpaid by any Loan Party under any Company Lease. True and
        complete copies of all Company Leases, together with all modifications,
        extensions, amendments and assignments thereof have heretofore been made
        available to the Administrative Agent. None of the Loan Parties has
        granted any options or rights of first refusal, or rights of first offer
        to third parties to purchase or otherwise acquire an interest in any of
        the Real Property.

                (c) Each Company owns, or is licensed to use, all Intellectual
        Property used in the conduct of its business as currently conducted,
        except for those the failure to own or license that, individually or in
        the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect. No claim has been asserted and is pending by any person
        challenging or questioning the use of any such Intellectual Property or
        the validity or effectiveness of any such Intellectual Property, nor
        does any Company know of any valid basis for any such claim. The use of
        such Intellectual Property by each Company does not infringe the rights
        of any person, except for such claims and infringements that,
        individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
        result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                (d) No Company has received any notice of, nor has any knowledge
        of, the occurrence or pendency or contemplation of any Casualty Event,
        zoning change, variance or special zoning exception affecting or that
        would affect all or any portion of the property.

        SECTION 3.06. EQUITY INTERESTS AND SUBSIDIARIES; CONSENT.

                (a) Schedule 3.06(a) sets forth a list of (i) all Subsidiaries
        of Holdings and their jurisdiction of organization as of the Closing
        Date; (ii) the number of shares of each class of its Equity Interests
        authorized, and the number outstanding, on the Closing Date and the
        number of shares covered by all outstanding options, warrants, rights of
        conversion or purchase and similar rights at the Closing Date of each
        such Subsidiary; and (iii) a designation as to whether such Subsidiary
        constitutes a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary. Schedule 3.06(a) designates the
        only Subsidiaries of Borrower that constitute Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
        on the Closing Date. Such schedule may be amended from time to time
        without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent so long as
        the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries comply with all related
        obligations under this Agreement (including obligations described in
        Section 5.11 hereof). All Equity Interests of each Subsidiary of
        Holdings are duly and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable
        and, except as disclosed on Schedule 3.06(a), are owned directly or
        indirectly by Holdings. All Equity Interests of Parent are owned
        directly by Holdings, all Equity Interests of Luxembourg Holdings are
        owned directly by Parent, all Equity Interests of Luxembourg CM and
        Luxembourg Intermediate Holdings are owned directly by Luxembourg
        Holdings, and all Equity Interests of Borrower are owned directly by the
        Luxembourg Intermediate Holdings. Each Loan Party is the record and
        beneficial owner of, and has good and marketable title to, the Equity
        Interests pledged by it under the applicable Security Agreement, free of
        any and all Liens, rights or claims of other persons, except for the
        security interest created by the Security Agreements.

                (b) No consent of any person including any other general or
        limited partner, any other member of a limited liability company, any
        other shareholder or any trust beneficiary is necessary or desirable in
        connection with the creation, perfection or first



                                       56
<PAGE>
        priority status of the security interest of the Collateral Agent in any
        Equity Interests, pledged to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
        Secured Parties under any Security Agreement or the exercise by the
        Collateral Agent of the voting or other rights provided for in any
        Security Agreement or the exercise of remedies in respect thereof.

        SECTION 3.07. LITIGATION; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.

                (a) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.07, there are no actions,
        suits or proceedings at law or in equity by or before any Governmental
        Authority now pending or, to the knowledge of any Company, threatened
        against or affecting any Company or any business, property or rights of
        any such person (i) that involve any Loan Document or the Transactions
        or (ii) as to which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
        determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be
        expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect.

                (b) Except for matters covered by Section 3.17, no Company or
        any of its property is in violation of, nor will the continued operation
        of their property as currently conducted violate, any Requirements of
        Law (including any zoning or building ordinance, code or approval or any
        building permits) or any restrictions of record or agreements affecting
        the Real Property or is in default with respect to any judgment, writ,
        injunction, decree or order of any Governmental Authority, in each case
        where such violation or default could reasonably be expected to result
        in a Material Adverse Effect.

        SECTION 3.08. AGREEMENTS.

                (a) No Company is a party to any agreement or instrument or
        subject to any corporate or other constitutional restriction that has
        resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
        Effect.

                (b) No Company is in default in any manner under any provision
        of any indenture or other agreement or instrument evidencing
        Indebtedness, or any other agreement or instrument to which it is a
        party or by which it or any of its property are or may be bound, where
        such default could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect.

                (c) Schedule 3.08 accurately and completely lists all material
        agreements (other than Leases of Real Property set forth on Schedule
        3.05(b)) to which any Loan Party is a party that are in effect on the
        Closing Date in connection with the operation of the business conducted
        thereby and Borrower has delivered to the Administrative Agent complete
        and correct copies of all such material agreements, including any
        amendments, supplements or modifications with respect thereto.

        SECTION 3.09. FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS.

                (a) No Company is engaged principally, or as one of its
        important activities, in the business of extending credit for the
        purpose of buying or carrying Margin Stock.

                (b) No part of the proceeds of any Loan or any Letter of Credit
        will be used in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, for any
        purpose that violates, or that is inconsistent with, the provisions of
        the regulations of the Board, including Regulation T,



                                       57
<PAGE>

        U or X. The pledge of the Securities Collateral pursuant to the Security
        Agreements does not violate such regulations.

        SECTION 3.10. INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT; PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY
ACT. No Company is (a) an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the

"affiliate" of a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company," as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, as amended.

        SECTION 3.11. USE OF PROCEEDS. Borrower will use the proceeds of (a) the
Term Loans to finance a portion of the Transactions and pay related fees and
expenses and (b) the Revolving Loans after the Closing Date for general
corporate purposes (it being understood that no Revolving Loans shall be made on
the Closing Date).

        SECTION 3.12. TAXES. Each Company has (a) filed or caused to be filed
all federal Tax Returns and all material state, local and foreign Tax Returns or
materials required to have been filed by it and (b) duly paid or caused to be
duly paid all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) due and payable by
it and all assessments received by it, except Taxes that are being contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which such Company shall have set
aside on its books adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP.

        SECTION 3.13. NO MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS. None of any information,
report, financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of
any Company to any Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of any
Loan Document or included therein or delivered pursuant thereto (including the
Offering Memorandum), taken together with all related information so furnished,
contained, contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or
omitted, omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were, are
or will be made, not misleading as of the date such information is dated or
certified; provided that, to the extent any such information, report, financial
statement, exhibit or schedule was based upon or constitutes a forecast,
projection or pro forma adjustment, each Company represents only that it acted
in good faith and utilized reasonable assumptions and due care in the
preparation of such information, report, financial statement, exhibit or
schedule (it being understood that, with respect to projected financial
information, actual results may vary significantly from such projected results).

insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of such Company except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the
Transactions will not give rise to any right of termination or right of
renegotiation on the part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement
to which any Company is bound.



                                       58
<PAGE>

        SECTION 3.15. SOLVENCY. Immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions to occur on the Closing Date and immediately following the making
of each Loan and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of each
Loan, (a) the fair value of the assets of the Loan Parties, taken as a whole,
will exceed their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise;
(b) the present fair saleable value of the property of the Loan Parties, taken
as a whole, will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the
probable liability of their collective debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) the Loan Parties, taken as a whole, will be
able to pay their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise,
as such debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) the Loan
Parties, taken as a whole, will not have unreasonably small capital with which
to conduct the business in which they are engaged as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Closing Date.

        SECTION 3.16. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                (a) Each Company and its ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in
        all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the
        Tax Code and the regulations and published interpretations thereunder.
        No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that,
        when taken together with all other such ERISA Events, could reasonably
        be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No liability to the
        PBGC (other than required premium payments), the Internal Revenue
        Service, any Plan or any trust established under Title IV of ERISA has
        been or is expected to be incurred by any Company or any ERISA
        Affiliate. No Company or ERISA Affiliate sponsors, contributes,
        participates in or has any liability under a plan established under
        Title IV of ERISA or a Multiemployer Plan.

                (b) Each Foreign Plan has been maintained in substantial
        compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all
        applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been
        maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory
        authorities, except when such failure to comply is not reasonably
        expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No Company has incurred
        any material obligation in connection with the termination of or
        withdrawal from any Foreign Plan that is reasonably expected to result
        in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of the accrued benefit
        liabilities (whether or not vested) under each Foreign Plan that is
        funded, determined as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal year
        of the respective Company on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of
        which is reasonable, did not exceed the current value of the assets of
        such Foreign Plan by an amount that is reasonably expected to result in
        a Material Adverse Effect.

        SECTION 3.17. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                (a) The Real Property of the Companies does not contain, and has
        not previously contained, therein, thereon or thereunder, including the
        soil and groundwater thereunder, any Hazardous Materials in amounts or
        concentrations that (i) constitute or constituted a violation of, (ii)
        require a Response under, or (iii) could give rise to liability under,
        Environmental Laws, which violations, Response and liabilities, in the
        aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
        Effect;

                (b) All operations of the Companies are in compliance, and, to
        the knowledge of the Companies, the Real Property is, and in the last
        three years such operations and the Real Property have been in
        compliance, with all Environmental Laws and all necessary



                                       59
<PAGE>

        permits have been obtained and are in effect, except to the extent that
        such non-compliance or failure to obtain any necessary permits, in the
        aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect;

                (c) There have been no Releases or threatened Releases by any
        Company or, to their knowledge, by any other party, at, from, under or
        proximate to the Real Property or otherwise in connection with the
        operations of any Company, which Releases or threatened Releases, in the
        aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
        Effect;

                (d) None of the Companies has received any notice of an
        Environmental Claim in connection with the Real Property or operations
        of any Company or with regard to any person whose liabilities for
        environmental matters any of the Companies has retained or assumed, in
        whole or in part, contractually, by operation of law or otherwise, that,
        in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
        Adverse Effect;

                (e) Hazardous Materials have not been transported from Real
        Property of the Companies by or on behalf of any of the Companies, nor
        have Hazardous Materials been generated, treated, stored or disposed of
        at, on or under any of such Real Property in a manner that could give
        rise to liability under, or in violation of, any Environmental Law, nor
        has any Company retained or assumed any liability, contractually, by
        operation of law or otherwise, with respect to the generation,
        treatment, storage, transport or disposal of Hazardous Materials, which
        transportation, generation, treatment, storage or disposal, or retained
        or assumed liabilities, in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected
        to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

                (f) No Lien has been recorded, or to the knowledge of any
        Company threatened, under any Environmental Law with respect to any
        owned Real Property or relating to any operations or assets of any
        Company;

                (g) No Real Property of the Companies is (i) listed or proposed
        for listing on the National Priorities List under CERCLA or (ii) to the
        knowledge of the Companies, listed on the Comprehensive Environmental
        Response, Compensation and Liability Information System promulgated
        pursuant to CERCLA, or (iii) to the knowledge of the Companies, included
        on any similar list maintained by any Governmental Authority (except in
        the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for listings relating to events or
        conditions that could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
        Adverse Effect); and

                (h) No Company is currently conducting any Response pursuant to
        any Environmental Law with respect to any Real Property or any other
        location except such waste management activities, air emission or water
        discharges which are conducted in compliance with Environmental Laws in
        the normal course of the Companies' operations or any other Response
        that could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
        Effect.

        SECTION 3.18. INSURANCE. Schedule 3.18 sets forth a true, complete and
correct description of all insurance maintained by each Loan Party as of the
Closing Date. As of each such date, such insurance is in full force and effect
and all premiums have been duly paid. Each Company has insurance in such amounts
and covering such risks and liabilities as are in accordance with normal
industry practice.

        SECTION 3.19. SECURITY DOCUMENTS.

                (a) The Security Agreements are effective to create in favor of
        the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal,
        valid and enforceable security interest in and Lien on the Security
        Agreement Collateral and, when (i) financing statements and other
        filings in appropriate form are filed in the offices specified in
        Section III.B of the Perfection Certificate and (ii) the Loan Parties
        have complied with Article III of the U.S. Security Agreement, the U.S.
        Security Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and
        security interest in, all right, title and interest of the grantors
        thereunder in such Collateral (other than (A) the Intellectual Property
        (as defined in the U.S. Security Agreement) and (B) such Collateral in
        which a security interest cannot be perfected under the Uniform
        Commercial Code as in effect at the relevant time in the relevant
        jurisdiction for filing), in each case subject to no Liens other than
        Permitted Liens.

                (b) When the U.S. Security Agreement is filed in the United
        States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright
        Office, the U.S. Security Agreement shall constitute a fully perfected
        Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of the
        grantors thereunder in the Intellectual Property (as defined in the U.S.
        Security Agreement), in each case subject to no Liens other than
        Permitted Liens (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the
        United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States
        Copyright Office may be necessary to perfect a Lien on registered

        favor of the Collateral Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Secured
        Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on all of the Loan Parties'
        right, title and interest in and to the Collateral described therein,
        and when such Security Document is filed or recorded in the appropriate
        offices as may be required under applicable law, such Security Document
        will constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all
        right, title and interest of the Loan Parties in such Security Agreement
        Collateral, in each case subject to no Liens other than the applicable
        Permitted Liens.

        SECTION 3.20. MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGES. Since December 31, 2001, there
has been no change that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                owner of or holder of an interest in such Mortgaged Real
                Property, no state of facts exist that could give rise to any
                such claim.

        copy of, or a certificate as to coverage under, the insurance policies

        consolidations or mergers by or involving any Company in accordance with
        Section 6.04; (ii) the withdrawal by any Company of its qualification as
        a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where such withdrawal,
        individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to
        result in a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) the abandonment by any
        Company of any property, rights, franchises, licenses, trademarks,
        tradenames, copyrights or patents that such person reasonably determines
        are not useful to its business.

        SECTION 5.04. INSURANCE.

                (a) Keep its insurable property adequately insured at all times
        by financially sound and reputable insurers; maintain such other
        insurance, to such extent and against such risks, including fire and
        other risks insured against by extended coverage, as is customary with
        companies in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or
        similar locations, including public liability insurance against claims
        for personal injury or death or property damage occurring upon, in,
        about or in connection with the use of any property owned, occupied or
        controlled by it, to the extent obtainable on commercially reasonable
        terms; and maintain such other insurance as may be required by law; and,
        with respect to any Mortgaged Property, otherwise maintain all insurance
        coverage required under the applicable Mortgage, such policies to be in
        such form and amounts and having such coverage as may be reasonably
        satisfactory to the Collateral Agent and the Lenders.

                (b) All such insurance shall (i) provide that no cancellation,
        material reduction in amount or material change in coverage thereof
        shall be effective until at least 30 days after receipt by the
        Collateral Agent of written notice thereof; (ii) name the Collateral
        Agent as insured party or loss payee; (iii) if reasonably requested by
        the Collateral Agent, include a breach-of-warranty clause; and (iv) be
        reasonably satisfactory in all other respects to the Collateral Agent.

                (c) Notify the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent
        immediately whenever any separate insurance concurrent in form or
        contributing in the event of loss with that required to be maintained
        under this Section 5.04 is taken out by any Company; and promptly
        deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent a duplicate
        original copy of such policy or policies.

                (d) Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the
        Collateral Agent and the Lenders a report of a reputable insurance
        broker annually with respect to such insurance and such supplemental
        reports with respect thereto as the Administrative Agent or the
        Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request.

        Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may from time to time
        require, to the extent obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, if
        at any time the area in which any improvements located on any real

before the same shall become delinquent or in default, as well as all lawful
claims for labor, materials and supplies or otherwise that, if unpaid, might
give rise to a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien) upon such properties or any
part thereof; provided, however, that such payment and discharge shall not be
required with respect to any such Taxes so long as the validity or amount
thereof shall be contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and the
applicable Company shall have set aside on its books adequate reserves with
respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and such proceeding (or orders entered
in connection with such proceedings) operate to prevent the forfeiture or sale
of the property or assets subject to any such Lien and suspend collection of the
contested Tax and enforcement of a Lien and, in the case of Collateral, the
applicable Company shall have otherwise complied with the provisions of the
applicable Security Document in connection with such nonpayment.

        SECTION 5.06. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) Comply in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Tax Code, and (b) furnish to the

expected to result in liability of the Companies or their ERISA Affiliates under

Company will permit any representatives designated by the Administrative Agent
or any Lender to visit and inspect the financial records and the property of

reasonable advance notice (no more frequently than twice during any fiscal year
of Parent and at the sole cost and expense of the Lenders unless a Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) and to make extracts
from and copies of such financial records, and permit any representatives
designated by the Administrative Agent or any Lender to discuss the affairs,
finances and condition of any

        SECTION 5.09. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS; ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS.

                (a) Comply and cause all lessees and other persons occupying
        Real Property, to the extent owned, operated or otherwise controlled by
        any Company, to comply, in all material respects with all Environmental
        Laws and Environmental Permits applicable to its operations and property
        and obtain and renew all material Environmental Permits applicable to
        its operations and property and conduct any Response in accordance with
        Environmental Laws; provided, however, that no Company shall be required

        being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings and appropriate
        reserves are being maintained with respect to such circumstances in
        accordance with GAAP.

                (b) If a Default caused by reason of a breach of Section 3.17 or
        5.09(a) shall have occurred and be continuing for more than 20 days
        without the Companies commencing activities reasonably likely to cure
        such Default, at the written request of the Required Lenders through the
        Administrative Agent, provide to the Lenders within 45 days after such
        request, at the expense of Borrower, an environmental site assessment
        report regarding the matters that are the subject of such default,
        including where appropriate, any soil and/or groundwater sampling
        prepared by an environmental consulting firm and in form and substance
        reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and indicating the
        presence or absence of Hazardous Materials and the estimated cost of any
        compliance or Response to address them in connection with such Default.

        SECTION 5.10. INTEREST RATE PROTECTION. No later than the 90th day after
the Closing Date, Borrower shall enter into, and for a minimum of three years
thereafter maintain, Interest Rate Protection Agreements acceptable to the
Administrative Agent that result in an amount to be determined by the
Administrative Agent of up to 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Terms
Loans outstanding hereunder being effectively subject to a fixed or maximum
interest rate acceptable to the Administrative Agent.

        SECTION 5.11. ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL; ADDITIONAL GUARANTORS.

                (a) Subject to this Section 5.11 and except to the extent the
        Administrative Agent (after consultation with Borrower) determines that
        any of the following is not commercially reasonable (taking into account
        the expense of obtaining the same, the ability of Borrower or the
        relevant Subsidiary to obtain any necessary approvals or consents
        required to be obtained under applicable law in connection therewith,
        and the effectiveness and enforceability thereof under applicable law),
        with respect to any assets acquired after the Closing Date by Holdings,
        Parent, the LuxCos, Borrower or any other Loan Party that are intended
        to be subject to the Lien created by any of the Security Documents but
        that are not so subject, and with respect to any assets held by
        Holdings, Parent, the LuxCos, and Borrower or any other Loan Party on
        the Closing Date not made subject to a Lien created by any of the
        Security Documents but of a type intended to be subject to the Lien
        created by the applicable Security Documents (but, in any event,
        excluding any assets described in Section 5.11(b)), promptly (and in any
        event within 60



                                       75
<PAGE>

        days after the acquisition thereof or upon the Administrative Agent's
        request): (i) execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent such
        amendments or supplements to the relevant Security Documents or such
        other documents as the Administrative Agent shall deem necessary or
        advisable to grant to the Administrative Agent, for its benefit and for
        the benefit of the other Secured Parties, a Lien on such properties or
        assets (including using its best efforts to deliver a Landlord Lien
        Waiver and Access Agreement with respect to each Real Property located
        in the United States in which a Loan Party holds the tenant's interest
        thereunder and where the Loan Parties maintain Collateral having a value
        in excess of $1.0 million), subject to no Liens other than Permitted
        Liens, and (ii) take all actions necessary to cause such Lien to be duly
        perfected to the extent required by such Security Document in accordance
        with all applicable Requirements of Law, including the filing of
        financing statements in such jurisdictions as may be reasonably
        requested by the Administrative Agent. Borrower shall otherwise take
        such actions and execute and/or deliver to the Administrative Agent such
        documents as the Administrative Agent shall require to confirm the
        validity, perfection and priority of the Lien of Security Documents
        against such after-acquired properties or assets, and such assets held
        on the Closing Date not made subject to a Lien created by any of the
        Security Documents.

                (b) To the extent the Administrative Agent (after consultation
        with Borrower) determines that any of the following is commercially
        reasonable (taking into account the expense (including taxes) of
        obtaining the same, the ability of Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary
        to obtain any necessary approvals or consents required to be obtained
        under applicable law in connection therewith, and the effectiveness and
        enforceability thereof under applicable law), with respect to any person
        that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
        that are listed on Schedule 5.11(b) (a "SECTION 5.11(b) LISTED
        SUBSIDIARY"), any Subsidiary that has become a Released Guarantor
        pursuant to Section 7.09, and any person that becomes a Wholly Owned
        Subsidiary of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date
        (a "NEW WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY"), promptly (and in any event (x) in the
        case of a New Wholly Owned Subsidiary, no later than 60 days after each
        such person becomes a New Wholly Owned Subsidiary, and (y) in the case
        of each Section 5.11(b) Listed Subsidiary or a New Wholly Owned
        Subsidiary that is required to become a Guarantor, or the stock or
        assets of which are required to be pledged, pursuant to clauses (i) and
        (ii) immediately below, no later than 90 days following the Closing Date
        and, in the case of any such Subsidiary that continues to not be a
        Guarantor, no later than 60 days following the close of any taxable year
        that such Subsidiary continues not to be a Guarantor), cause such
        Subsidiary (i) to become a Guarantor and deliver to the Administrative
        Agent the certificates representing the Equity Interests of such
        Subsidiary (provided that, in no event shall the stock of any such
        Subsidiary be required to be pledged if such pledge is illegal under
        applicable law and no reasonable alternative structure can be devised
        having substantially the same effect as such pledge that would not be
        illegal under applicable law), together with undated stock powers
        executed and delivered in blank by a duly authorized officer of such
        Subsidiary's parent, as the case may be, and all Intercompany Notes
        owing from such Subsidiary to any Loan Party; and (ii) (A) to execute a
        Joinder Agreement or such comparable documentation, in form and
        substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, and (B)
        to take all actions reasonably necessary or advisable to cause the Lien
        created by each Security Agreement to be duly perfected to the extent
        required by such agreement in accordance with all applicable
        Requirements of Law, including the filing of financing statements in
        such jurisdictions as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative
        Agent (provided that any such Subsidiary shall not be required to comply
        with clause (ii)(A) and (B) above if satisfying such requirements is
        illegal under



                                       76
<PAGE>

        applicable law and no reasonable alternative structure can be devised
        having substantially the same effect as such pledge that would not be
        illegal under applicable law).

                (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein:

                        (i) in the case of any (x) Section 5.11(b) Listed
                Subsidiary and New Wholly Owned Subsidiary that has not
                previously become (and, if so, does not remain) a Guarantor and
                (y) other Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, 65% of the Equity Interests
                of any such Subsidiary (and 100% of the Equity Interests of any
                Domesticated Foreign Subsidiary) shall be subject to a Lien or
                be required to be pledged under the applicable Loan Document
                (except to the extent the Administrative Agent (after
                consultation with Borrower) determines that such Lien or pledge
                is not commercially reasonable (taking into account the expense
                (including taxes) of obtaining the same, the ability of Borrower
                or such Subsidiary to obtain any necessary approvals or consents
                required to be obtained under applicable law in connection
                therewith, and the effectiveness and enforceability thereof
                under applicable law)); and

                        (ii) notwithstanding clause (c)(i) immediately above and
                as of the end of any fiscal quarter of Parent:

                                (1) if the aggregate consolidated revenues of
                        the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries exceeds 35.0% of Parent's
                        consolidated revenues, then within 60 days of such date
                        Borrower shall cause a sufficient number of the
                        Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to become Guarantors
                        hereunder so that, after giving pro forma effect to such
                        action, the aggregate consolidated revenues of the
                        Subsidiaries remaining as Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries is
                        less than 35.0% of Parent's consolidated revenues; or

                                (2) if the aggregate consolidated sum of the
                        Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries' fixed assets, receivables
                        and inventories exceeds 35.0% of the aggregate
                        consolidated sum of Parent's fixed assets, receivables
                        and inventories (which fixed assets, receivables and
                        inventories shall be computed after eliminating
                        intercompany profit), then within 60 days of such date
                        Borrower shall cause a sufficient number of the
                        Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to become Guarantors
                        hereunder so that, after giving pro forma effect to such
                        action, the aggregate consolidated sum of fixed assets,
                        receivables and inventories of the Subsidiaries
                        remaining as Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries is less than
                        35.0% of the aggregate consolidated sum of Parent's
                        fixed assets, receivables and inventories.

                If the condition set forth in clause (ii)(1) or (ii)(2) above is
        established, Borrower shall, or shall cause the applicable Foreign
        Subsidiaries to, take all such further action and execute and deliver
        all such further agreements or documents as the Administrative Agent
        deems necessary or advisable to receive the full benefits of the
        Guarantees and Security Documents to be entered into by such Foreign
        Subsidiaries to the extent



                                       77
<PAGE>

        necessary to preclude the 35.0% thresholds set forth in the immediately
        preceding clauses (ii)(1) and (ii)(2) from being exceeded, except to the
        extent such actions, executions, or, deliveries are illegal under
        applicable law, and no reasonable alternative structure can be devised
        having substantially the same effect as such actions, executions, or
        deliveries that would not be illegal under applicable law.

                (d) REAL PROPERTY. Upon the written request of the
        Administrative Agent (provided that, except as otherwise provided in
        Section 5.12, the Administrative Agent shall not make such written
        request if (after consultation with Borrower) it determines that any of
        the following is not commercially feasible (taking into account the
        expense of obtaining the same and the effectiveness and enforceability
        thereof under applicable law)), each Loan Party will promptly grant to
        the Administrative Agent, within 60 days of such request, security
        interests and Mortgages in such owned or leased Real Property of such
        Loan Party located in the United States as is acquired or leased by such
        Loan Party after the Closing Date by Borrower or such Subsidiary and
        that is used for warehouse, manufacturing, distribution, or laboratory
        purposes, has a value as determined in good faith by the Administrative
        Agent in excess of $1.0 million or is otherwise material to the business
        operations of Borrower or such Subsidiary, as additional security for
        the Secured Obligations (unless (i) the subject property is already
        mortgaged to a third party to the extent permitted by Section 6.02 or
        (ii) in the encumbrancing of such leased Real Property requires the
        consent of any applicable lessor, where Parent and its Subsidiaries have
        attempted in good faith, but are unable, to obtain such lessor's
        consent). Such Mortgages shall be granted pursuant to documentation
        reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Collateral Agent
        and shall constitute valid and enforceable perfected Liens subject only
        to Permitted Liens and such other Liens reasonably acceptable to the
        Collateral Agent. The Mortgages or instruments related thereto shall be
        duly recorded or filed in such manner and in such places as are required
        by law to establish, perfect, preserve and protect the Liens in favor of
        the Collateral Agent required to be granted pursuant to the Mortgages
        and all taxes, fees and other charges payable in connection therewith
        shall be paid in full. Such Loan Party shall otherwise take such actions
        and execute and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent such documents as the
        Administrative Agent shall require to confirm the validity, perfection
        and priority of the Lien of any existing Mortgage or new Mortgage
        against such after-acquired Real Property (including a Title Policy, a
        survey and local counsel opinion (in form and substance reasonably
        satisfactory to the Collateral Agent) and all other items described in
        Section 4.02(o) in respect of such Mortgage) within 60 days of the
        written request of the Collateral Agent.

        SECTION 5.12. SECURITY INTERESTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each Loan Party
shall, at its own cost and expense, take any and all actions necessary to defend
title to the Collateral against all persons and to defend the security interest
of the Collateral Agent in the Collateral and the priority thereof against any
Lien not expressly permitted pursuant to Section 6.02. Promptly, upon the
reasonable request of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Collateral
Agent, at Borrower's expense, execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause the
execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter register, file or
record, or cause to be registered, filed or recorded, in an appropriate
governmental office, any document or instrument supplemental to or confirmatory
of the Security Documents or otherwise deemed by Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent reasonably necessary or desirable for the continued validity,
perfection and priority of the Liens on the Collateral covered thereby superior
and prior to the rights of all third persons other than the holders of Permitted
Liens and subject to other Liens except as permitted by the Security Documents,
or obtain any



                                       78
<PAGE>

consents, including landlord or similar Lien waivers and consents, as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection therewith, to the extent contemplated
hereby. Deliver or cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent from time
to time such other documentation, consents, authorizations, approvals and orders
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as the
Administrative Agent shall deem necessary to perfect or maintain the Liens on
the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents. Upon the exercise by the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent of any power, right, privilege or
remedy pursuant to any Loan Document that requires any consent, approval,
registration, qualification or authorization of any Governmental Authority or
any other person, execute and deliver and/or obtain all applications,
certifications, instruments and other documents and papers that the
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may be so required to obtain.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent shall have the right to require any Loan Party to execute and
deliver documentation, consents, authorizations, approvals and orders in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as the
Administrative Agent shall deem necessary to grant to the Administrative Agent,
for its benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties, a valid and
perfected Lien subject to no Liens other than Permitted Liens on such assets and
properties not otherwise required hereunder, except to the extent such
requirements are illegal under applicable law, and no reasonable alternative
structure can be devised having substantially the same effect as such actions
that would not be illegal under applicable law. If the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent or the Required Lenders determine that they are required by law
or regulation to have appraisals prepared in respect of the Real Property of any

        Borrower's business, and (ii) performing other necessary operational

                (e) With respect to Borrower and its Subsidiaries, engage
        (directly or indirectly) in any business other than those businesses in
        which Borrower and its Subsidiaries are engaged on the Closing Date (or
        that are complementary or substantially related thereto or are
        reasonable extensions thereof).

        SECTION 6.14. LIMITATION ON ACCOUNTING CHANGES. Make or permit any
change in accounting policies or reporting practices without the consent of the

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    GUARANTEE

        SECTION 7.01. THE GUARANTEE. The Guarantors hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally, jointly and severally guarantee as primary obligors and not as
sureties to each Secured Party and their respective successors and assigns the
prompt payment in full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) of the principal of and interest on (including any interest, fees,
costs or charges that would accrue but for the provisions of Title 11 of the
United States Code after any bankruptcy or insolvency petition under Title 11 of
the United



                                       92
<PAGE>

States Code) the Loans made by the Lenders to, and the Notes held by each Lender
of, Borrower, and all other Obligations from time to time owing to the Secured
Parties by any Loan Party under any Loan Document or Interest Rate Protection
Agreement relating to the Loans, in each case strictly in accordance with the
terms thereof (such obligations being herein collectively called the "GUARANTEED
OBLIGATIONS"). The Guarantors hereby irrevocably and unconditionally, jointly
and severally agree that if Borrower or other Guarantor(s) shall fail to pay in
full when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, the Guarantors will promptly pay the same, without
any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension of time
of payment or renewal of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, the same will be
promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

        SECTION 7.02. OBLIGATIONS UNCONDITIONAL. The obligations of the
Guarantors under Section 7.01 shall constitute a guaranty of payment (and not of
collection) and are absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, joint and several
(except to the extent otherwise limited in accordance with applicable
Requirements of Law as described in Annex IV attached hereto or in any other
Guarantee required by applicable Requirements of Law), irrespective of the
value, genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Notes, if any, or any other
agreement or instrument referred to herein or therein, or any substitution,
release or exchange of any other guarantee of or security for any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever that might otherwise
constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a surety or Guarantor
(except for payment in full). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
it is agreed that the occurrence of any one or more of the following shall not
alter or impair the liability of the Guarantors hereunder, which shall remain
absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances as
described above:

                        (i) at any time or from time to time, without notice to
                the Guarantors, the time for any performance of or compliance
                with any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be extended, or
                such performance or compliance shall be waived;

                        (ii) any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions
                of this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement
                or instrument referred to herein or therein shall be done or
                omitted;

                        (iii) the maturity of any of the Guaranteed Obligations
                shall be accelerated, or any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall
                be amended in any respect, or any right under the Loan Documents
                or any other agreement or instrument referred to herein or
                therein shall be amended or waived in any respect or any other
                guarantee of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security
                therefor shall be released or exchanged in whole or in part or
                otherwise dealt with;

                        (iv) any Lien or security interest granted to, or in
                favor of, the Issuing Bank or any Lender or Agent as security
                for any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall fail to be
                perfected; or

                        (v) the release of any other Guarantor.



                                       93
<PAGE>

        The Guarantors hereby expressly waive diligence, presentment, demand of
payment, protest and all notices whatsoever, and any requirement that any Loan
Party exhaust any right, power or remedy or proceed against Borrower under this
Agreement or the Notes, if any, or any other agreement or instrument referred to
herein or therein, or against any other person under any other guarantee of, or
security for, any of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors waive any and
all notice of the creation, renewal, extension, waiver, termination or accrual
of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by any
Secured Party upon this Guarantee or acceptance of this Guarantee, and the
Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have
been created, contracted or incurred in reliance upon this Guarantee, and all
dealings between Borrower and the Secured Parties shall likewise be conclusively
presumed to have been had or consummated in reliance upon this Guarantee. This
Guarantee shall be construed as a continuing, absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to any right of offset with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations at any time or from time to time held by
the Secured Parties, and the obligations and liabilities of the Guarantors
hereunder shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by the Secured
Parties or any other person at any time of any right or remedy against Borrower
or against any other person that may be or become liable in respect of all or
any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or against any collateral or guarantee
therefor or right of offset with respect thereto. This Guarantee shall remain in
full force and effect and be binding in accordance with and to the extent of its
terms upon the Guarantors and the successors and assigns thereof, and shall
inure to the benefit of the Lenders, and their respective successors and
assigns, notwithstanding that from time to time during the term of this
Agreement there may be no Guaranteed Obligations outstanding.

        For purposes of this paragraph only, references to the "principal"
include each Loan Party and references to the "creditor" include each Secured
Party. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code, each
Guarantor waives all rights and defenses (i) available to such Guarantor by
reason of Sections 2787 through 2855, 2899, and 3433 of the California Civil
Code, including all rights or defenses such Guarantor may have by reason of
protection afforded to the principal with respect to any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, or to any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations with
respect to any of such guarantor's obligations under its guarantee, in either
case in accordance with the antideficiency or other laws of the State of
California limiting or discharging the principal's Indebtedness or such other
guarantor's obligations, including Sections 580a, 580b, 580d and 726 of the
California Code of Civil Procedure; and (ii) arising out of an election of
remedies by the creditor, even though such election, such as a nonjudicial
foreclosure with respect to security for any Guaranteed Obligation (or any
obligation of any other guarantor of any of the Guaranteed Obligations), has
destroyed such Guarantor's right of subrogation and reimbursement against the
principal (or such other guarantor) by the operation of Section 580d of the
California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise. No other provision of this
Guarantee shall be construed as limiting the generality of any of the covenants
and waivers set forth in this paragraph. As provided below, this Agreement shall
be governed by, and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York. This paragraph is included solely out of an abundance
of caution, and shall not be construed to mean that any of the above-referenced
provisions of California law are in any way applicable to this Agreement or to
any of the Guaranteed Obligations.

        SECTION 7.03. REINSTATEMENT. The obligations of the Guarantors under
this Article VII shall be automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for
any reason any payment by or on behalf of Holdings, Borrower or any other Loan
Party in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must be otherwise
restored by any holder of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether as a result
of any proceedings in bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise. The



                                       94
<PAGE>

Guarantors jointly and severally (except to the extent otherwise limited in
accordance with applicable Requirements of Law as described in Annex IV attached
hereto or in any other Guarantee required by applicable Requirements of Law)
agree that they will indemnify each Secured Party on demand for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by such
Secured Party in connection with such rescission or restoration, including any
such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim alleging that
such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or similar payment
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, other than any costs or
expenses resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of
such Secured Party.

        SECTION 7.04. SUBROGATION; SUBORDINATION. Each Guarantor hereby agrees
that until the indefeasible payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all
Guaranteed Obligations and the expiration and termination of the Commitments of
the Lenders under this Agreement it shall not exercise any right or remedy
arising by reason of any performance by it of its guarantee in Section 7.01,
whether by subrogation or otherwise, against Borrower or any other Guarantor of
any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any security for any of the Guaranteed
Obligations. The payment of any amounts due with respect to any indebtedness of
Borrower or any other Guarantor now or hereafter owing to any Guarantor or
Borrower by reason of any payment by such Guarantor under the Guarantee in this
Article VII is hereby subordinated to the prior indefeasible payment in full in
cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. In addition, any Indebtedness of the
Guarantors now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated in
right of payment in full in cash to the Guaranteed Obligations. Each Guarantor
agrees that it will not demand, sue for or otherwise attempt to collect any such
indebtedness of Borrower or any other Guarantor to such Guarantor until the
Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. If,
notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Guarantor shall, prior to the
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations, collect,
enforce or receive any amounts in respect of such indebtedness, such amounts
shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the
Secured Parties and be paid over to Administrative Agent on account of the
Guaranteed Obligations without affecting in any manner the liability of such
Guarantor under the other provisions of the guaranty contained herein.

        SECTION 7.05. REMEDIES. The Guarantors jointly and severally (except to
the extent otherwise limited in accordance with applicable Requirements of Law
as described in Annex IV attached hereto) agree that, as between the Guarantors
and the Lenders, the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes,
if any, may be declared to be forthwith due and payable as provided in Article
VIII (and shall be deemed to have become automatically due and payable in the
circumstances provided in said Article VIII) for purposes of Section 7.01,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
declaration (or such obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as
against Borrower and that, in the event of such declaration (or such obligations
being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), such obligations
(whether or not due and payable by Borrower) shall forthwith become due and
payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section 7.01.

        SECTION 7.06. INSTRUMENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY. Each Guarantor hereby
acknowledges that the guarantee in this Article VII constitutes an instrument
for the payment of money, and consents and agrees that any Lender or Agent, at
its sole option, in the event of a dispute by such Guarantor in the payment of
any moneys due hereunder, shall have the right to bring a motion-action under
New York CPLR Section 3213 to the extent permitted thereunder.

        SECTION 7.07. GENERAL LIMITATION ON GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS. In any action
or proceeding involving any state corporate law, or any state, federal or
foreign bankruptcy,



                                       95
<PAGE>

insolvency, reorganization or other law affecting the rights of creditors
generally, if the obligations of any Guarantor under Section 7.01 would
otherwise be held or determined to be void, voidable, invalid or unenforceable,
or subordinated to the claims of any other creditors, on account of the amount
of its liability under Section 7.01, then, notwithstanding any other provision
to the contrary, the amount of such liability shall, without any further action
by such Guarantor, any Loan Party or any other person, be automatically limited
and reduced to the highest amount that is valid and enforceable and not
subordinated to the claims of other creditors as determined in such action or
proceeding.

        SECTION 7.08. CONTINUING GUARANTEE. The Guarantees in this Article VII
are continuing guarantees of payment, and shall apply to all Guaranteed
Obligations whenever arising.

        SECTION 7.09. RELEASE OF GUARANTORS. If at any time after the Closing
Date and in connection with the Guarantee of any Loan Party in this Article VII
(i) subject to the requirements of Section 5.11(c), in the case of a Foreign
Subsidiary, the Administrative Agent (after consultation with Borrower)
determines that in the case of any existing Guarantor, it would not be
commercially reasonable for such Guarantor to remain a Guarantor (taking into
account the expense (including taxes), the ability of Borrower or such Guarantor
to obtain any necessary approvals or consents required to be obtained under
applicable law (but have not been previously obtained) in connection therewith,
and the effectiveness and enforceability thereof under applicable law) or (ii)
such Guarantee becomes illegal under applicable law and such Loan Party delivers
to the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Collateral Agent a legal
opinion from its counsel to such effect, and no reasonable alternative structure
can be devised having substantially the same effect as the issuance of a
Guarantee that would not be illegal under applicable law, then, so long as the
Senior Subordinated Note Guarantee of such Loan Party has been released or is
contemporaneously released under the Senior Subordinated Note Documents, in case
of each of the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the Collateral Agent
shall (at the expense of Borrower) take all action necessary to release its
security interest in that portion of the Security Agreement Collateral owned by
such Guarantor (provided, however, that 65% of the Equity Interests of such
Guarantor (and 100% of the Equity Interests of any Domesticated Foreign
Subsidiary) shall not be released from the Security Agreement Collateral)), and
such Guarantor shall be released from its obligations in respect of the
Guarantees in this Article VII (such Guarantor being hereinafter referred to as
a "RELEASED GUARANTOR," so long as it continues to be a Non-Guarantor
Subsidiary), which release from such Guarantees, in the case of an event
described in the immediately preceding clause (i), shall become effective as of
the closing of the last day of the taxable year that immediately precedes the
date that the Administrative Agent makes a determination described in such
clause (i); provided that, such Released Guarantor shall continue to be subject
to Section 5.11(b).

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

DEFAULT"):

                (a) default shall be made in the payment of any principal of any

<PAGE>

        due and payable, whether at the due date thereof (including a Term Loan
        Repayment Date) or at a date fixed for prepayment thereof or by
        acceleration thereof or otherwise;

                (b) default shall be made in the payment of any interest on any
        Loan or any Fee or any other amount (other than an amount referred to in
        paragraph (a) above) due under any Loan Document, when and as the same
        shall become due and payable, and such default shall continue unremedied
        for a period of five Business Days;

                (c) any representation or warranty made or deemed made in or in
        connection with any Loan Document or the borrowings or issuances of
        Letters of Credit hereunder, or any representation, warranty, statement
        or information contained in any report, certificate, financial statement
        or other instrument furnished in connection with or pursuant to any Loan
        Document, shall prove to have been false or misleading in any material
        respect when so made, deemed made or furnished;

                (d) default shall be made in the due observance or performance
        by any Company of any covenant, condition or agreement contained in
        Section 5.02, 5.03 or 5.08 or in Article VI;

                (e) default shall be made in the due observance or performance
        by any Company of any covenant, condition or agreement contained in any
        Loan Document (other than those specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (d)
        above), or under any Hedging Agreement entered into with any Lender or
        Affiliate of a Lender, and such default shall continue unremedied or
        shall not be waived for a period of 30 days after the earlier of (i) an
        Officer of such Company becoming aware of such default or (ii) receipt
        by Borrower and such Company of notice from the Administrative Agent or
        any Lender of such default; provided, however, that with respect to any
        default in obligations under Section 5.09(a), such 30-day period shall
        be extended if the relevant Company has commenced and continues
        diligently to pursue prudent and necessary response actions and
        otherwise complies with Section 5.09(b) and any applicable Environmental
        Laws;

                (f) any Company (other than any Immaterial Subsidiary) shall (i)
        fail to pay any principal or interest, regardless of amount, due in
        respect of any Indebtedness (other than the Obligations) when and as the
        same shall become due and payable (after all applicable grace periods
        have expired); or (ii) fail to observe or perform any other term,
        covenant, condition or agreement contained in any agreement or
        instrument evidencing or governing any such Indebtedness if the effect
        of any failure referred to in this clause (ii) is to cause, or to permit
        the holder or holders of such Indebtedness or a trustee on its or their
        behalf (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or both)
        to cause, such Indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity;
        provided that, it shall not constitute an Event of Default pursuant to
        this paragraph (f) unless the aggregate amount of all such Indebtedness
        referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) exceeds $5.0 million at any one
        time;

                (g) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an
        involuntary petition shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction
        seeking (i) relief in respect of any Company (other than any Immaterial
        Subsidiary), or of a substantial part of the property or assets of any
        Company (other than any Immaterial Subsidiary), under the Bankruptcy
        Code, or any other federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency,
        receivership or similar law; (ii) the appointment of a receiver,

        under the Bankruptcy Code, or any other federal, state or foreign

        shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by
        a judgment creditor to levy upon assets or properties of any Company to
        enforce any such judgment;

                (j) an ERISA Event occurs, an event of noncompliance with
        respect to any Foreign Plan occurs or, if the present value of the

        Plan that is funded, determined as of the end of the most recently ended
        fiscal year of the respective Loan Party on the basis of actuarial
        assumptions proper under applicable foreign law, exceeds the current
        value of the assets of such Foreign Plan by more than $1.0 million, that
        in the opinion of the Required Lenders, when taken together with all
        other such ERISA Events, noncompliance and underfunding, could
        reasonably be expected to result in liability to any Company or its

                (m) any Loan Document or any material provisions thereof shall
        at any time and for any reason be declared by a court of competent
        jurisdiction to be null and void, or a proceeding shall be commenced by
        any Loan Party or any other person, or by any Governmental Authority,

then, and in every such event (other than an event described in paragraph (g) or
(h) above), and at any time thereafter during the continuance of such event, the
Administrative Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by
notice to Borrower, take either or both of the following actions, at the same or
different times: (i) terminate forthwith the Commitments; (ii) declare the Loans
then outstanding to be forthwith due and payable in whole or in part, whereupon
the principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with
accrued interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities
of Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall become
forthwith due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower and the
Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the
contrary notwithstanding; and (iii) direct Borrower to pay (and Borrower hereby
agrees upon receipt of such notice, or upon the occurrence of any event
specified in paragraph (g) or (h) above to pay) to the Administrative Agent such
additional amounts of cash, to be invested in Cash Equivalents and held as
security for Borrower's reimbursement Obligations in respect of Letters of
Credit then outstanding, equal to the LC Exposure at such time. In any event
described in paragraph (g) or (h) above, the Commitments shall automatically
terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued
interest thereon and any unpaid accrued Fees and all other liabilities of
Borrower accrued hereunder and under any other Loan Document, shall
automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or
any other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by
Borrower and the Guarantors, anything contained herein or in any other Loan
Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

             COLLATERAL ACCOUNT; APPLICATION OF COLLATERAL PROCEEDS

        SECTION 9.01. COLLATERAL ACCOUNT.

                (a) The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized to establish and
        maintain at its office at 677 Washington Boulevard, Stamford,
        Connecticut 06901, in the name of the Collateral Agent and pursuant to a
        Control Agreement, a restricted deposit account designated "Collateral
        Account." Each Loan Party shall deposit into the Collateral Account from
        time to time (i) the cash proceeds of any of the Collateral (including
        pursuant to any disposition thereof) to the extent contemplated herein
        or in any other Loan Document, (ii) the cash proceeds of any Casualty
        Event with respect to Collateral to the extent contemplated herein or in
        any other Loan Document, and (iii) any cash such



                                       99
<PAGE>

        Loan Party is required to pledge as additional collateral security
        hereunder pursuant to the Loan Documents.

                (b) The balance from time to time in the Collateral Account
        shall constitute part of the Collateral and shall not constitute payment
        of the Obligations until applied as hereinafter provided. So long as no
        Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or will result
        therefrom, the Collateral Agent shall, within two Business Days of
        receiving a request of the applicable Loan Party for release of cash
        proceeds constituting (i) Net Cash Proceeds from the Collateral Account,
        remit such cash proceeds on deposit in the Collateral Account to or upon
        the order of such Loan Party, so long as such Loan Party has satisfied
        the conditions relating thereto set forth in Section 9.02; (ii) Net Cash
        Proceeds from any sale or other disposition of Collateral from the
        Collateral Account, remit such cash proceeds on deposit in the
        Collateral Account, so long as such Loan Party has satisfied the
        conditions relating thereto set forth in Section 9.02; and (iii) with
        respect to the LC Sub-Account at such time as all Letters of Credit
        shall have been terminated and all of the liabilities in respect of the
        Letters of Credit have been indefeasibly paid in full. At any time
        following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
        Default, the Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed by the Required
        Lenders as specified herein, shall) in its (or their) discretion apply
        or cause to be applied (subject to collection) the balance from time to
        time outstanding to the credit of the Collateral Account to the payment
        of the Obligations in the manner specified in Section 9.03, subject,
        however, in the case of amounts deposited in the LC Sub-Account, to the
        provisions of Sections 2.17(j) and 9.03. The Loan Parties shall have no
        right to withdraw, transfer or otherwise receive any funds deposited in
        the Collateral Account except to the extent specifically provided
        herein.

                (c) Amounts on deposit in the Collateral Account shall be
        invested from time to time in Cash Equivalents as the applicable Loan
        Party (or, after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
        of Default, the Collateral Agent) shall determine, which Cash
        Equivalents shall be held in the name and be under the control of the
        Collateral Agent (or any sub-agent); provided that, at any time after
        the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
        Collateral Agent may (and, if instructed by the Required Lenders as
        specified herein, shall) in its (or their) discretion at any time and
        from time to time elect to liquidate any such Cash Equivalents and to
        apply or cause to be applied the proceeds thereof to the payment of the
        Obligations in the manner specified in Section 9.03.

                (d) Amounts deposited into the Collateral Account as cover for
        liabilities in respect of Letters of Credit under any provision of this
        Agreement requiring such cover shall be held by the Administrative Agent
        in a separate sub-account designated as the "LC Sub-Account" (the "LC
        SUB-ACCOUNT").

        SECTION 9.02. PROCEEDS OF CASUALTY EVENTS AND COLLATERAL DISPOSITIONS.

                (a) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
        continuing, in the event there shall be any Net Cash Proceeds in respect
        of any Casualty Event or from any Asset Sale of Collateral, the
        applicable Loan Party shall have the right, at such Loan Party's option,
        to apply such Net Cash Proceeds in accordance with the applicable
        provisions of this Agreement.



                                      100
<PAGE>

                (b) In the event any Net Cash Proceeds are required to be
        deposited in the Collateral Account in accordance with Section 2.10, the
        Collateral Agent shall not release any part of such Net Cash Proceeds
        until the applicable Loan Party has furnished to the Collateral Agent
        (i) an Officers' Certificate setting forth: (A) a brief description of
        the reason for the release, (B) the dollar amount of the expenditures to
        be made, or costs incurred by such Loan Party in connection with such
        release and (C) each request for payment shall be made on at least ten
        day's prior notice to the Collateral Agent and such request shall state
        that the properties acquired in connection with such release have a fair
        market value at least equal to the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds
        requested to be released from the Collateral Account; and (ii) all
        security agreements and Mortgages and other items required by the
        provisions of Sections 5.11 and 5.12 to, among other things, subject
        such reinvestment properties or assets to the Lien of the Security
        Documents in favor of the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the
        benefit of the other Secured Parties.

        SECTION 9.03. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. The proceeds received by the
Collateral Agent in respect of any sale of, collection from or other realization
upon all or any part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by the
Collateral Agent of its remedies shall be applied, together with any other sums
then held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement, promptly by the
Collateral Agent as follows:

                (a) First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and expenses,
        fees, commissions and taxes of such sale, collection or other
        realization, including compensation to the Collateral Agent and its
        agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and advances made or
        incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection therewith, together with
        interest on each such amount at the highest rate then in effect under
        this Agreement from and after the date such amount is due, owing or
        unpaid until paid in full;

                (b) Second, to the payment of all other reasonable costs and
        expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, including
        compensation to the other Secured Parties and their agents and counsel
        and all costs, liabilities and advances made or incurred by the other
        Secured Parties in connection therewith, together with interest on each
        such amount at the highest rate then in effect under this Agreement from
        and after the date such amount is due, owing or unpaid until paid in
        full;

                (c) Third, without duplication of amounts applied pursuant to
        clauses (a) and (b) above, to the indefeasible payment in full in cash,
        pro rata, of (i) interest, principal and other amounts constituting
        Obligations (other than the Obligations arising under the Interest Rate
        Protection Agreements), in each case equally and ratably in accordance
        with the respective amounts thereof then due and owing and (ii) the
        Obligations arising under the Interest Rate Protection Agreements in
        accordance with the terms of the Interest Rate Protection Agreements;
        and

                (d) Fourth, the balance, if any, to the person lawfully entitled
        thereto (including the applicable Loan Party or its successors or
        assigns).

In the event that any such proceeds are insufficient to pay in full the items
described in clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 9.03, the Loan Parties
shall remain liable for any deficiency.

                                    ARTICLE X

                THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT

        Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent (it being understood that reference in this Article X to
the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to include the Collateral Agent) as its
agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf
and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the
terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto.

        The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

        The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except
those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any
fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred
and is continuing; (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take
any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.02); and (c) except as
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is
communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any
of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 11.02) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative
Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by Borrower or a
Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any
duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation
made in or in connection with any Loan Document; (ii) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection
therewith; (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants,
agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document; (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or
any other agreement, instrument or document; or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than
to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

        The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected
by it, and shall not be liable for



                                      102
<PAGE>

any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

        The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise
its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Affiliates. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs
shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Affiliates of each Administrative
Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in
connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as
well as activities as Administrative Agent.

        The Administrative Agent may resign as administrative agent hereunder at
any time upon at least 30-days' prior notice to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank
and Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the
right, in consultation with Borrower, to appoint a successor from among the
Lenders. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders or
shall have accepted appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative
Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent, which successor shall be a commercial banking institution
organized under the laws of the United States (or any state thereof) or a United
States branch or agency of a commercial banking institution, and having combined
capital and surplus of at least $250.0 million; provided, however, that if such
retiring Administrative Agent is unable to find a commercial banking institution
which is willing to accept such appointment and which meets the qualifications
set forth above, the retiring Administrative Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective, and the Lenders shall assume and
perform all of the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder until such time,
if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor as provided above. Upon the
acceptance by a successor of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between Borrower and such successor. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article X and Section 11.03 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Affiliates in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

        Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance
upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or
related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

        The Lenders identified in this Agreement, the Syndication Agent and the
Documentation Agent shall not have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all
Lenders. Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Syndication Agent nor the
Documentation Agent shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship
with any Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with



                                      103
<PAGE>

respect to the Syndication Agent and the Documentation Agent as it makes with
respect to the Administrative Agent or any other Lender in this Article X.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge that the
Documentation Agent and Syndication Agent hold such titles in name only, and
that such titles confer no additional rights or obligations relative to those
conferred on any Lender hereunder.

All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance

in accordance with the latest unrevoked direction from such party given in
accordance with this Section 11.01, and failure to deliver courtesy copies of
notices and other communications shall in no event affect the validity or
effectiveness of such notices and other communications.

        SECTION 11.02.WAIVERS; AMENDMENT.

                (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the
        Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right
        or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a
        waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such
        right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
        such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
        the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
        Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank and the
        Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
        are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise
        have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any
        departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective
        unless the same shall be permitted by Section 11.02(b), and then such
        waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
        for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the
        foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall
        not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
        Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Lender or the Issuing
        Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.



                                      105
<PAGE>

                (b) Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
        provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except,
        in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
        writing entered into by Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the
        case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements
        in writing entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party
        or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the written
        consent of the Required Lenders; provided that, no such agreement shall
        (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of
        such Lender; (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC
        Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any Fees
        payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected
        thereby (except in connection with any waiver of the applicability of
        any post-default increase in interest rates); (iii) postpone the
        maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of payment of or installment
        otherwise due on the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section
        2.09, or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or
        any date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or
        reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the
        scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment or postpone the scheduled
        date of expiration of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Maturity
        Date, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby; (iv)
        change Section 2.14(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
        sharing of payments or set-offs required thereby without the written
        consent of each Lender; (v) change the percentage set forth in the
        definition of "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan
        Document (including this Section 11.02(b)) specifying the number or
        percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend
        or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any
        consent thereunder without the written consent of each Lender (or each
        Lender of such Class, as the case may be); (vi) except as otherwise
        expressly permitted under this Agreement, (A) release Holdings, Parent
        or any of the LuxCos from its Guarantee or limit its liability in
        respect of such Guarantee or (B) release all or substantially all of the
        Subsidiary Guarantors from their Guarantees, or limit the liability of
        all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors in respect of
        their Guarantees, in each case without the written consent of each
        Lender; (vii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral from
        the Liens of the Security Documents or alter the relative priorities of
        the Obligations entitled to the Liens of the Security Documents (except
        in connection with securing additional Obligations equally and ratably
        with the other Obligations), in each case without the written consent of
        each Lender; or (viii) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a
        manner that by its terms adversely affects the rights in respect of
        payments due to Lenders holding Loans of any Class differently than
        those holding Loans of any other Class without the written consent of
        Lenders holding a majority in interest of the outstanding Loans and
        unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided further that, (1) no
        such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
        duties of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, or the Issuing
        Bank without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the
        Collateral Agent, or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be; and (2) any
        waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by its terms
        affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of the Revolving
        Lenders (but not the Term Lenders) or the Term Lenders (but not the
        Revolving Lenders) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in
        writing entered into by Borrower and the requisite percentage in
        interest of the affected Class of Lenders that would be required to
        consent thereto under this Section 11.02(b) if such Class of Lenders
        were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the time. Notwithstanding
        the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended by an
        agreement in writing entered into by Borrower, the Required Lenders and
        the Administrative Agent (and, if its



                                      106
<PAGE>

        rights or obligations are affected thereby, the Issuing Bank) if (x) by
        the terms of such agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting
        to the amendment provided for therein shall terminate upon the
        effectiveness of such amendment and (y) at the time such amendment
        becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment
        in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it
        and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this
        Agreement.

                (c) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
        discharge or termination of any of the provisions of this Agreement as
        contemplated by Section 11.02(b), the consent of the Required Lenders is
        obtained but the consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose
        consent is required is not obtained, then Borrower shall have the right
        to replace one or more of such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (so long
        as all non-consenting Lenders are so replaced) with one or more persons
        pursuant to Section 2.16 so long as at the time of such replacement each
        such new Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or
        termination; provided, however, that Borrower shall not have the right
        to replace a Lender solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's
        rights (and the withholding of any required consent by such Lender)
        pursuant to Section 11.02(b).

        SECTION 11.03.EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

                (a) Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
        (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of counsel, expenses
        incurred in connection with due diligence and travel, courier,
        reproduction, printing and delivery expenses) incurred by the
        Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Issuing Bank in connection
        with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein and
        the preparation, execution and delivery, administration of this
        Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with any
        amendments, modifications, enforcement costs or waivers of the
        provisions hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby or
        thereby contemplated shall be consummated), or incurred by the
        Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any Lender in connection with the
        enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this
        Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans
        made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including the reasonable
        fees, charges and disbursements of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
        LLP, special counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral
        Agent (and one local counsel in each foreign jurisdiction where the
        Administrative Agent deems such local counsel advisable and any
        additional counsel to the Lenders required in the event of a conflict of
        interest), and, in connection with any such enforcement or protection,
        the fees, charges and disbursements of any consultants and advisors in
        connection with any out-of-court workout or in any bankruptcy case.

                (b) Except to the extent otherwise limited in accordance with
        applicable Requirements of Law as described in Annex IV attached hereto,
        the Loan Parties agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify the Agents,
        the Arranger, each Lender, and the Issuing Bank, each Affiliate of any
        of the foregoing persons, and each of their respective directors,
        officers, trustees, employees and agents (each such person being called
        an "INDEMNITEE") against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, all
        reasonable out-of-pocket costs and any and all losses, claims, damages,
        liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees,
        charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any
        Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with, or as a result of
        (i) any actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans or issuances
        of Letters of Credit; (ii)



                                      107
<PAGE>

        any claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
        the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; or
        (iii) any actual or alleged presence or Release or threatened Release of
        Hazardous Materials, on, under or from any property owned, leased or
        operated by any Company, or any Environmental Claim related in any way
        to any Company; provided that, such indemnity shall not, as to any
        Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
        damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
        competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
        resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of
        such Indemnitee.

                (c) The provisions of this Section 11.03 shall remain operative
        and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term of
        this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
        hereby, the repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the
        Commitments, the expiration of any Letter of Credit, the invalidity or
        unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or any other
        Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agents,
        the Arranger, the Issuing Bank or any Lender. All amounts due under this
        Section 11.03 shall be payable on written demand therefor accompanied by
        reasonable documentation with respect to any reimbursement,
        indemnification or other amount requested.

                (d) To the extent that the Loan Parties fail to pay any amount
        required to be paid by it to the Agents, the Arranger or the Issuing
        Bank under Section 11.03(a) or (b), each Lender severally agrees to pay
        to the Agents, the Arranger or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
        such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the
        applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
        unpaid amount; provided that, the unreimbursed expense or indemnified
        loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be,
        was incurred by or asserted against any of the Agents, the Arranger or
        the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a
        Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of
        the sum of the total Revolving Exposure, outstanding Term Loans and
        unused Commitments at the time.

        SECTION 11.04.SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

                (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and
        inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
        successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the
        Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that no Loan
        Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
        hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
        attempted assignment or transfer by any Loan Party without such consent
        shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
        shall be construed to confer upon any person (other than the parties
        hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
        (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of
        Credit) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Affiliates
        of each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or
        equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                (b) Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees (other than
        Holdings or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries) all or a portion of
        its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
        portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it);
        provided that, (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender, an
        Affiliate of a Lender or a Lender Affiliate, each of Borrower and the
        Administrative Agent (and, in the



                                      108
<PAGE>

        case of an assignment of all or a portion of a Revolving Commitment or
        any Lender's obligations in respect of its LC Exposure, the Issuing
        Bank) must give their prior written consent to such assignment (which
        consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) except in
        the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or a
        Lender Affiliate, any assignment made in connection with the primary
        syndication of the Commitment and Loans by the Arranger or an assignment
        of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or
        Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender
        subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the
        Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is delivered
        to the Administrative Agent) shall be in a principal amount that is an
        integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1.0 million, unless
        each of Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent; (iii)
        each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
        proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
        under this Agreement, except that this clause (iii) shall not be
        construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the
        assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Class of
        Commitments or Loans; (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute
        and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
        together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and (v) the
        assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
        Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire; provided further
        that, any consent of Borrower otherwise required under this Section
        11.04(b) shall not be required if a Default or an Event of Default under
        Article VIII has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and
        recording thereof pursuant to Section 11.04(d), from and after the
        effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee
        thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
        assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and
        obligations of a Lender under this Agreement (provided that, any
        liability of Borrower to such assignee under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15
        shall be limited to the amount, if any, that would have been payable
        thereunder by Borrower in the absence of such assignment), and the
        assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
        assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
        obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
        Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
        under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but
        shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13,
        2.15 and 11.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
        obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section
        11.04(b) shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by
        such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
        accordance with Section 11.04(e).

                (c) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an
        agent of Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in Stamford,
        Connecticut a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and
        a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the
        Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC
        Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
        time to time (the "REGISTER"). The entries in the Register shall be
        conclusive and Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and
        the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register
        pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of
        this Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by
        Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and
        from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.



                                      109
<PAGE>

                (d) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
        Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
        assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee
        shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee
        referred to in Section 11.04(b) and any written consent to such
        assignment required by Section 11.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall
        accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information
        contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for
        purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register
        as provided in this Section 11.04(d).

                (e) Any Lender may, without the consent of Borrower, the
        Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, sell participations to one or
        more banks or other entities (a "PARTICIPANT") in all or a portion of
        such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all
        or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided
        that, (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
        unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
        parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii)
        Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other
        Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
        connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
        Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells
        such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
        sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment,
        modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents; provided
        that, such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
        not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
        modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
        11.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to Section 11.04(f),
        Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
        of Sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a
        Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section
        11.04(b). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
        entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender;
        provided that, such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.14(c)
        as though it were a Lender.

                (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
        payment under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender
        would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
        sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such
        Participant is made with the prior written consent of Borrower. A
        Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not
        be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless Borrower is notified
        of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
        agrees, for the benefit of Borrower, to comply with Section 2.15(e) as
        though it were a Lender.

                (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
        interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
        secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to
        secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and the other provisions
        of this Section 11.04 shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment
        of a security interest; provided that, no such pledge or assignment of a
        security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations
        hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
        a party hereto.

        SECTION 11.05. SURVIVAL OF AGREEMENT. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan



                                      110
<PAGE>

Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge
of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit
is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated.
The provisions of Sections 2.12, 2.14, 2.15 and 11.03 and Article X shall
survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration
or termination of the Letters of Credit and the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

        SECTION 11.06. COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other
Loan Documents, the Engagement Letter, the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter
constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or
written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section
4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by
the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

        SECTION 11.07. SEVERABILITY. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

        SECTION 11.08. RIGHT OF SET-OFF. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates are hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final (other than deposits in trust accounts)) at any
time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to
or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party against any of and all the
obligations of any Loan Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made
any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured.
The rights of each Lender under this Section 11.08 are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including other rights of set-off) that such Lender may
have.

        SECTION 11.09.GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; CONSENT TO SERVICE OF
PROCESS.

                (a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND
        GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING SECTIONS 5-1401
        AND 5-1402 OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK).



                                      111
<PAGE>

                (b) Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
        submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction
        of the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County
        and of the United States District Court of the Southern District of New
        York, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
        proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document, or for
        recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties
        hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
        respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
        such New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such federal
        court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
        such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
        other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
        provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document
        shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank
        or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
        relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any Loan
        Party or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

                (c) Each Loan Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
        waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
        objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
        any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
        Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in Section
        11.09(b). Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
        fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
        the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
        of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.01. Nothing
        in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of
        any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
        permitted by law.

        SECTION 11.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.10.

        SECTION 11.11. HEADINGS. Article and section headings and the table of
contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

        SECTION 11.12. CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to
its and its Lender Affiliates' directors,



                                      112
<PAGE>

officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other
advisors (it being understood that the persons to whom such disclosure is made
will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed
to keep such Information confidential pursuant to the terms hereof); (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority; (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process; (d)
to any other party to this Agreement; (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder;
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section 11.12, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to Borrower and its
obligations; (g) with the consent of Borrower; or (h) to the extent such
Information (i) is publicly available at the time of disclosure or becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 11.12, or
(ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than Borrower or any
Subsidiary. For the purposes of this Section 11.12, "INFORMATION" shall mean all
information received from Borrower or any Subsidiary on a confidential basis
relating to Borrower or any Subsidiary or its business, other than any such
information that is available to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower or any
Subsidiary. Any person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section 11.12 shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such person would accord to
its own confidential information.

        SECTION 11.13. INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "CHARGES"), shall exceed the
maximum lawful rate (the "MAXIMUM RATE") that may be contracted for, charged,
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section 11.13 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

        SECTION 11.14. OBLIGATIONS CONDITIONAL ON MAKING OF INITIAL LOANS.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Borrower has no obligation or
liability arising under this Agreement until the date on which the initial Loans
are made under this Agreement.
