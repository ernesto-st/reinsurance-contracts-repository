transaction, as if the same had occurred immediately prior to the date for which such financial covenant or
financial ratio is being calculated.

Section 1.09 Foreign Currencies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
for purposes of any determination under Article VI, Article VII (other than Section 7.11 or other financial
ratio) or Article VIII with respect to the amount of any Debt, Liens, Affiliate transaction or other transaction,
event or circumstance, or any determination under any other provision of this Agreement, (any of the
foregoing, a &#x201C;Specified Transaction&#x201D;) in a currency other than Dollars, (i) the Dollar equivalent amount of a
Specified Transaction in a currency other than Dollars shall be calculated based on the rate of exchange
quoted by the Bloomberg Foreign Exchange Rates &amp; World Currencies Page (or any successor page thereto,
or in the event such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Page, by reference to such other publicly
available service for displaying exchange rates as may be agreed upon by the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower) for such currency, as in effect at 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the date of such Specified
Transaction; provided, that if any Debt is incurred (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) to refinance
or replace other Debt denominated in a currency other than Dollar, and such refinancing or replacement
would cause the applicable Dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing or replacement, such Dollar-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
or replacement Debt (and, if applicable, associated Lien granted) does not exceed an amount sufficient to
repay the principal amount of such Debt being refinanced or replaced, except by an amount equal to unpaid
accrued interest and premiums (including tender premiums) thereon plus other reasonable and customary
fees and expenses (including upfront fees and original issue discount) incurred in connection with such
refinancing or replacement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, no Default or Event of Default shall be
deemed to have occurred solely as a result of a change in the rates of currency exchange occurring after the
time of any Specified Transaction so long as such Specified Transaction was permitted at the time incurred,
made, acquired, committed, entered or declared as set forth in clause (i). For purposes of Section 7.11 and
the calculation of compliance with any financial ratio or test for purposes of taking any action hereunder, on
any date of determination, amounts in currencies other than Dollars shall be translated into Dollars at the
currency exchange rate used in preparing the financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(i) or
(ii) corresponding thereto as of the date of determination and will, in the case of Debt, reflect the currency
translation effects, determined in accordance with GAAP, of any Swap Contract in respect of currency
exchange risks with respect to the applicable currency in effect on the date of determination for the Dollar
equivalent amount of such Debt.
Section 1.10 Interest Rate; Benchmark Notification. The interest rate on a Loan denominated
in Dollars may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the
future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event,
Section 2.13 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. Except as otherwise
specifically provided for in this Agreement (including with respect to the quotation of the Prime Rate), the
Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, (a)
the continuation of, the administration of, submission of, calculation of, performance of or any other matter
related to any interest rate used in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Base Rate (other than

rate (or component thereof) used in this Agreement or any alternative, successor or alternative rate (including
any Benchmark Replacement) and/or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to
the Borrower. The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable
discretion to ascertain any interest rate used in this Agreement, any component thereof, or rates referred to
in the definition thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to
the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect,
special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error in the calculation of any such rate (or component

or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan
Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a
conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Term Benchmark Loans, (ii) the
requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business
Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to
be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest
Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the
Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans
shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans
shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Term
Benchmark Loans. If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term
Benchmark Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have
specified an Interest Period of one month.
(b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of
a conversion or continuation is provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify
each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans described in the preceding
subsection. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in
immediately available funds at the Administrative Agent&#x2019;s Office not later than 3:00 p.m. on the Business
Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
Section 4.02, the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable
Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the
Borrower on the books of RBC with the amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each
case in accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent
by the applicable Borrower. Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to the Borrower by
causing any foreign or domestic branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any
exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.
(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term Benchmark Loan may be continued or
converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term Benchmark Loan. During the existence
of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as, converted to or continued as Term Benchmark Loans
without the consent of the Required Lenders.
(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the
interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for Term Benchmark Loans upon determination of such
interest rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of any change in the Prime Rate used in determining the Base Rate promptly
following the public announcement of such change.
(e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the
other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in
effect with respect to Loans.
Section 2.03 Prepayments.
(a) The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time

Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Term Benchmark Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall be in a
principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the
entire principal amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of
such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Term Benchmark Loans are to be prepaid,
the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its
receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender&#x2019;s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment.
If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount
specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein; provided that such notice
may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified therein, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior
to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any prepayment of a Term Benchmark
Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional
amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.12, each such prepayment shall be applied
to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.
(b) If for any reason the Outstanding Amount at any time exceeds the Aggregate
Commitments then in effect, the Borrower shall immediately prepay Loans in an aggregate amount equal
to such excess.
Section 2.04 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.
(a) Optional. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the
Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitments; provided
that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. three
Business Days (or such shorter period acceptable to the Administrative Agent) prior to the date of
termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or
any whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the
Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the
Outstanding Amount would exceed the Aggregate Commitments. The Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the Lenders of any notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments; provided that
such notice may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of one or more events specified
therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent
on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any reduction of the Aggregate
Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage.
All fees accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on
the effective date of such termination.
(b) Mandatory. The Aggregate Commitments shall be automatically and permanently
reduced to zero on the Commitment Termination Date.
Section 2.05 Repayment of Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Commitment
Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date, together with accrued
and unpaid interest thereon and all other Obligations then due and owing.
Section 2.06 Interest.
(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) below, (i) each Term Benchmark Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal
to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate and (ii) each Base Rate </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g043.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 37 -
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at
a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8.01(a) and/or 8.01(f),
the Obligations hereunder shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws, automatically accrue
interest at the Default Rate.
(c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, any Term
Benchmark Loan will, upon the request of the Required Lenders, convert to a Base Rate Loan at the end of
the Interest Period then in effect for such Term Benchmark Loan.
(d) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date
applicable thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and
payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
(e) In connection with the use or administration of SOFR or the Term SOFR Reference
Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes,
in consultation with the Borrower, from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement
or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders
of the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with the use or
administration of SOFR or Term SOFR Reference Rate, as applicable
Section 2.07 Fees.
(a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender (other than any Defaulting Lenders) in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a
commitment fee equal to the Applicable Rate times the average daily amount by which the Aggregate
Commitments exceed the Outstanding Amount. The commitment fee shall accrue at all times during the
Availability Period, and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
March, June, September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the Effective
Date, and on the last day of the Availability Period.
(b)Other Fees.
(i) The Borrower shall pay to the Arranger, the Administrative Agent, and the
Lenders (as defined in the Engagement Letter) pursuant to the Engagement Letter for their own
respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Engagement Letter. All
such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
(ii)The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately
agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned
when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
Section 2.08 Computation of Interest and Fees All computations of interest for Term
Benchmark Loans and other fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual
days elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). All
computations of interest for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year, as the
case may be, and actual days elapsed.

is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest
rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
Section 2.09 Evidence of Debt. The Borrowings made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one
or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Register maintained by the Administrative
Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by each Lender and the
Register maintained by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of
the Borrowings made by the Lenders and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any
error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to
pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts
and records maintained by any Lender and the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent in respect
of such matters, the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest
error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute
and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender&#x2019;s
Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse
thereon the date, Type, amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.
Section 2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent&#x2019;s Clawback.
(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative
Agent&#x2019;s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified
herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or
other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such
Lender&#x2019;s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall be
deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected
in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b)Clawback.
(i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any
Borrowing of Term Benchmark Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior
to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender&#x2019;s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such
share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such
event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available
funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available
to the applicable Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g045.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 39 -
a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged
by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to
be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such
Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by
the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender&#x2019;s Loan included in
such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the
Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the
Administrative Agent.
(ii)Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the
Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower
have made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower have not in
fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender, in immediately available
funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal
Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or Borrower with respect to any amount owing under
this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to the
Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions
of this Article II, and such funds are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the Administrative
Agent because the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in like
funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d)Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Loans and payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to
make any Loan or payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any
other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for
the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).
(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the
funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it
has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan or other funding obligation in any particular place or
manner.
Section 2.11 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the
Loans made by it resulting in such Lender&#x2019;s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of
such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro-rata share thereof as provided herein, then the
Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (i) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (ii) </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g046.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 40 -
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders
ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
Loans and other amounts owing to them, provided that:
(i) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest;
and
(ii)the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment
made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender)
or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant.
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may effectively do so
under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements
may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.
Section 2.12 Defaulting Lenders.
(a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting
Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i) Termination of Defaulting Lender Commitment. The Borrower may terminate
the unused amount of the Commitment of a Defaulting Lender upon not less than two Business
Days&#x2019; prior notice to the Administrative Agent (which will promptly notify the Lenders thereof),
and in such event the provisions of clause (iii) below will apply to all amounts thereafter paid by
the Borrower for the account of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement (whether on account
of principal, interest, fees, indemnity or other amounts), provided that such termination will not be
deemed to be a waiver or release of any claim the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, or any
Lender may have against such Defaulting Lender, or cause such Defaulting Lender to be a Non-Defaulting Lender.
(ii)Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender&#x2019;s right to approve or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as
set forth in the definition of &#x201C;Required Lenders&#x201D; and Section 10.01.
(iii) Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether
voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the
Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be applied at such
time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment
of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second,
as the Borrower may request (if no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan
in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this
Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g047.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 41 -

Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting
Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such
payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting
Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied
solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to
the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the
Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments. Any payments, prepayments or other
amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by
a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)(iii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by
such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(iv) Certain Fees. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, during such
period as a Lender is a Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender will not be entitled to any fees
accruing during such period pursuant to Section 2.07(a) (without prejudice to the rights of the Non-Defaulting Lenders in respect of such fees).
(b)Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing
in their discretion that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify
the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions
set forth therein, such Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par such portion of outstanding
Loans of the other Lenders and/or make such other adjustments as the Administrative Agent may determine
to be necessary to cause the principal amount of the outstanding Loans of the Lenders to be on a pro-rata
basis in accordance with their respective Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a
Defaulting Lender and will be a Non-Defaulting Lender (and such outstanding principal amount of the
Loans of each Lender will automatically be adjusted on a prospective basis to reflect the foregoing);
provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by
or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided further that except
to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting
Lender to Non-Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder
arising from such Lender&#x2019;s having been a Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.13 Benchmark Replacement.
(a) Benchmark Replacement. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any
other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark
Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current
Benchmark, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the
then-current Benchmark and (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1)
of the definition of &#x201C;Benchmark Replacement&#x201D; for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark
Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in
respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or
further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a
Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of &#x201C;Benchmark

Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent
of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has
not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders
comprising the Required Lenders and (ii) no Swap Contract shall be deemed to be a &#x201C;Loan Document&#x201D; for
purposes of this Section 2.13. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to
this Section 2.13(a) will occur prior to the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date.
(b) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use,
administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will
have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments
implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective without any
further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(c) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement,
(ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes in connection with the use,
administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement and (iii) any Benchmark
Transition Event and any Benchmark Replacement Date. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify
the Borrower of the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.13(d). Any
determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent or, if applicable, any
Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.13, including any determination with respect to a
tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any
decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent
manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this
Section 2.13.
(d) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
or in any other Loan Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a
Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR
Reference Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other
information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in
its reasonable discretion or (B) the administrator of such Benchmark or the regulatory supervisor for the
administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing
that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with
the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks
(the &#x201C;IOSCO Principles&#x201D;), then the Agent may modify the definition of &#x201C;Interest Period&#x201D; (or any similar or
analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable, non-representative, non-compliant or non-aligned tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause
(i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including
a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will
not be representative or in compliance with or aligned with the IOSCO Principles for a Benchmark
(including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of
&#x201C;Interest Period&#x201D; (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to
reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(e) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower&#x2019;s receipt of notice of the
commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke any request for a Term </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g049.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 43 -

Available Tenor, the component of Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for
such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of Base Rate.
ARTICLE III
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
Section 3.01 Taxes.
(a) Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 3.01 the term &#x201C;applicable Law&#x201D; includes
FATCA.
(b)Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes,
except as required by applicable Law. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion
of an applicable Withholding Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such
payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such
deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Laws and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then
the sum payable by the applicable Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or
withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(c) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent
timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(d)Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient, within
30 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by
such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly
or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of
such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Recipient (with a copy to the Administrative
Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Recipient, shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.
(e) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the
Administrative Agent within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to
such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent
for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes
attributable to such Lender&#x2019;s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 10.06(d) relating to the
maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each
case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g050.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 44 -

amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative
Agent under this paragraph (e).
(f) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the
Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(g) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.
(i) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested
by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by
applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements or to avoid or reduce any withholding
tax. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(g)(ii)(A), 3.01(g)(ii)(B), 3.01(g)(ii)(D), and 3.01(g)(iii) below) shall not be required
if in the Lender&#x2019;s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject
such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal
or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(A) each Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender

such direct and indirect partner;
(C) each Non-U.S. Lender Party shall, to the extent it is legally entitled

applicable), such Non-U.S. Lender Party shall deliver to the Borrower and the

expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification
and deliver them to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent or promptly notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised
in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this
Section 3.01 (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01), it shall pay to
the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made
under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such
indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid pursuant to this paragraph (h)
(plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event
that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the indemnified party be
required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which
would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party
would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been
deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with
respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified
party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems
confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(i) Survival. Each party&#x2019;s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall survive the resignation
or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender,
the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under
any Loan Document.
Section 3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law or introduction of any
law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender
or its Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference to the Term
SOFR Rate, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term SOFR Rate (a &#x201C;Term SOFR
Illegality Event&#x201D;), then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative
Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to make or continue Term Benchmark Loans or to convert Base
Rate Loans to Term Benchmark Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of
such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference
to the Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such
Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without
reference to the Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term Benchmark Loans of such Lender to
Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR Rate component
of the Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue
to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such Term Benchmark Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g053.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 47 -

during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to
the Term Benchmark component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender
that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon the Term
Benchmark. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted and any amount payable pursuant to Section 3.05. During any period in
which a Term SOFR Illegality Event is in effect, the Borrower may request, through the Administrative
Agent, that the Lenders affected by such Term SOFR Illegality Event confirm that the circumstances giving
rise to the Term SOFR Illegality Event continue to be in effect. If, within ten (10) Business Days following
such confirmation request, such Lenders have not confirmed the continued effectiveness of such Term SOFR
Illegality Event, then such Term SOFR Illegality Event shall no longer be deemed to be in effect; provided,
that (A) the Borrower shall not be permitted to submit any such request more than once in any 30-day period
and (B) nothing contained in this Section 3.02 or the failure to provide confirmation of the continued
effectiveness of such Term SOFR Illegality Event shall in any way affect the Lenders&#x2019; right to provide any
additional notices of an Term SOFR Illegality Event as provided in this Section 3.02.
Section 3.03 Inability to Determine Rates. Unless the provisions of Section 2.13 apply, if the
Required Lenders determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Term Benchmark Loan
or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining
the Term SOFR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term Benchmark Loan or
in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Term SOFR Rate for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term Benchmark Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the
cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan (each, a &#x201C;Market Disruption Event&#x201D;), the Administrative Agent
will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make
or maintain Term Benchmark Loans shall be suspended, and (y) in the event of a determination described in
the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of
the Term SOFR Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the
Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of
such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation
of Term Benchmark Loans or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for
a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.
Section 3.04 Increased Costs; Reserves on Term Benchmark Loans.
(a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory
loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated
by Section 3.04(e));
(ii)subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B)
Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of &#x201C;Excluded Taxes&#x201D; and
(C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or
its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii) impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes)
affecting this Agreement or Term Benchmark Loans made by such Lender (except any reserve
requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e)), </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g054.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 48 -
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to,
continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR
Rate (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received
or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon
request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such
Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender&#x2019;s holding company, if any, regarding capital
or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender&#x2019;s capital
or on the capital of such Lender&#x2019;s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the
Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender
or such Lender&#x2019;s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender&#x2019;s policies and the policies of such Lender&#x2019;s holding company with respect to
capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender&#x2019;s holding company for any such
reduction suffered.
(c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section 3.04 and delivered to the Borrower, shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 30 days
after receipt thereof.
(d)Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender&#x2019;s right to
demand such compensation.
Section 3.05 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold
such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:
(i) such Lender&#x2019;s actual loss, cost and expense incurred by such Lender as a
consequence of (a) Borrower&#x2019;s failure to make any payment when due on a Term Benchmark Loan,
(b) any payment, prepayment or conversion of any Term Benchmark Loan on a day other than the
last day of the Interest Period, or (c) any failure to make a borrowing or conversion of a Term
Benchmark Loan after giving notice thereof, in each case whether voluntarily, by reason of
acceleration or otherwise; provided that such loss, cost or expense shall exclude any loss of
anticipated profit and all administrative, processing or similar fees. Any Lender requesting
compensation under this Section shall be required to deliver a certificate to the Borrower that sets
forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section, the
basis therefor and, in reasonable detail, the manner in which such amount or amounts were
determined, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. A certificate as to any
amounts payable pursuant to this paragraph given to Borrower&#x2019;s by Administrative Agent shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and shall be payable within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of such certificate;
(ii)any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender
to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on
the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or</font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g055.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 49 -
(iii) any assignment of a Term Benchmark Loan on a day other than the last day
of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;
including any loss of anticipated profits (other than margins) and any loss or expense arising from the
liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate
the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary
administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under this
Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Term Benchmark Loan made by it at the
Term SOFR Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London interbank
eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Term
Benchmark Loan was in fact so funded.
Section 3.06Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender
or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender
gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the Borrower, such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts then or thereafter payable
pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to Section
3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense
and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.
(b)Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a
notice pursuant to Section 3.02, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a
different Lending Office in accordance with Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in
accordance with Section 10.13.
Section 3.07 Survival. All of the Borrower&#x2019;s obligations under this Article III shall survive
termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other Obligations hereunder, and resignation

does not conflict with the rights of any other Person, except to the extent that such failure to own, license
or possess or such conflicts, either individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to

the statements therein (when taken as a whole), in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not materially misleading. The preliminary, projected or pro-forma information contained in the
materials referenced in the preceding sentence (if any) were prepared in good faith based upon assumptions
believed to be reasonable at the time made (it being understood that such projected or pro-forma information
is subject to uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are outside the control of the Borrower, and

would be prohibited by enforceable anti-assignment provisions of any
Contractual Obligation or applicable law or would violate the terms of any
Contractual Obligation relating to such asset (in each case, after giving
effect to the applicable anti-assignment provisions of the UCC or other

ARTICLE IX
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT
Section 9.01 Appointment and Authority.
(a) Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints RBC to act on its behalf as the
Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. Except to the extent expressly set forth in Sections 9.02, 9.05, 9.06, 9.11 and 9.12, the provisions
of this Article IX are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and the Borrower
shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that
the use of the term &#x201C;agent&#x201D; herein or in any other Loan Document (or any other similar term) with reference
to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting
parties.
(b) Royal Bank of Canada shall irrevocably act as the &#x201C;collateral agent&#x201D; under the Loan
Documents, and each of the Lenders (including in its capacities as a potential Secured Hedging
Counterparty and/or Secured Cash Management Bank) hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as the agent of (and to hold any security interest created by the Security
Documents for and on behalf of or in trust for) such Lender for purposes of acquiring, holding and enforcing
any and all Liens on Collateral granted by any of the Loan Parties to secure any of the Obligations, together
with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto. In this connection, the Administrative
Agent, as &#x201C;collateral agent&#x201D; (and any co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact appointed by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.05 for purposes of holding or enforcing any Lien on the
Collateral (or any portion thereof) granted under the Security Documents, or for exercising any rights and
remedies thereunder at the direction of the Administrative Agent), shall be entitled to the benefits of all
provisions of this Article IX (including Section 9.07, as though such co-agents, sub-agents and attorneys-in-fact were the &#x201C;collateral agent&#x201D; under the Loan Documents) as if set forth in full herein with respect
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Lenders and each other Secured Party hereby
expressly authorize the Administrative Agent to execute any and all documents (including releases) with
respect to the Collateral and the rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto, as contemplated by and
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents and acknowledge and
agree that any such action by Royal Bank of Canada in its capacity as Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent shall bind the Lenders and each other Secured Party.
Section 9.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder
shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and the term &#x201C;Lender&#x201D; or &#x201C;Lenders&#x201D; shall, unless
otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the
Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity.

any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose such Agent to liability or

effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of
any Debtor Relief Law; and
(iii) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Loan Parties or any of their Affiliates that is communicated to or
obtained by the Person serving as an Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i)

under the circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of (A) its own bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct or (B) a material breach hereunder under any Loan Document,
in each case, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and non-appealable judgment.
The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or the event or events
that give or may give rise to any Default unless and until the Borrower or any Lender shall have given
notice to the Administrative Agent describing such Default and such event or events.
(c) No Agent-Related Person shall be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty, representation or other information made or supplied in or in

items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
(d) Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall require the Administrative
Agent or any of its Related Parties to carry out any &#x201C;know your customer&#x201D; or other checks in relation to any
Person on behalf of any Lender, and each Lender confirms to the Administrative Agent that it is solely
responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in
relation to such checks made by the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties.
Section 9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Agents shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,
document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other
distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the
proper Person. Each Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In
determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan that by its terms must be
fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is
satisfactory to such Lender unless an officer of the Administrative Agent responsible for the transactions
contemplated hereby shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such
Loan. Each Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in
accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 9.05 Delegation of Duties. Each Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise
its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by such Agent. Each Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Agent-Related Persons. The exculpatory
provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the each Agent and
any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the
credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Agents. No Agent shall be responsible for the
negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.
Section 9.06 Resignation and Removal of Administrative Agent.
(a) The Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent may at any time give notice of its
resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent
or Collateral Agent, as applicable, with the consent, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of the Borrower (such consent not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), provided

applicable, without the written consent of the Borrower. If no such successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day
as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the &#x201C;Resignation Effective Date&#x201D;), then the retiring

determine that the Person serving as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is (without taking into
account any provision in the definition of &#x201C;Defaulting Lender&#x201D; requiring notice from the Administrative
Agent or any other party) a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (v) of the definition thereof, the Required
Lenders (determined after giving effect to Section 10.01) may by written notice to the Borrower and such

withheld, conditioned or delayed). Such removal will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws,
be effective on the earlier of the date (the &#x201C;Removal Effective Date&#x201D;) (i) on which a replacement
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent is appointed and (ii) which is 30 days after the giving of such
notice by the Required Lenders (regardless of whether a replacement Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent, as applicable, has been appointed).
(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as
applicable) (i) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent shall be discharged from
its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (ii) except for any indemnity
payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and
determinations provided to be made by, to or through such Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender
directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent, as applicable, as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor&#x2019;s appointment
as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or
removed Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as applicable, as of the Resignation Effective Date or
Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to
its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or
removed Agent&#x2019;s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of
this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as
applicable.

has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis

without reliance upon the any Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own
decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or

proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to the Borrower, the

expenses, disbursements and advances of the Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any
other amounts due the Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04.

remedies (other than the Required Lenders exercising such rights and remedies through the
Administrative Agent); provided that the foregoing shall not preclude any Lender from exercising
any right of set-off in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.09, enforcing compliance with
the provisions set forth in Section 10.01(b) or filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing
pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to any Loan Party under
any Debtor Relief Law.
(b) Each Agent, each Lender and each other Secured Party agrees that it will promptly take
such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower (such actions
and such execution, the &#x201C;Release Actions&#x201D;), at the Borrower&#x2019;s sole cost and expense, in connection with a
Lien Release Event and/or Guaranty Release Event and that such actions are not discretionary. Without
limitation, the Release Actions may include, as applicable, (a) executing (if required) and delivering to the
Loan Parties (or any designee of the Loan Parties) any such lien releases, mortgage releases or assignments
of mortgages, discharges of security interests, pledges and guarantees and other similar discharge or release

Certificate&#x201D;) delivered to each Agent confirming that (a) such Lien Release Event and/or Guaranty Release
Event, as applicable, has occurred or will upon consummation of one or more identified transactions (an

Event have been satisfied or will be satisfied upon consummation of an Identified Transaction, and (c) that
any such Identified Transaction is permitted by (or not prohibited by) the Loan Documents (including
pursuant to a valid waiver or consent). The Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent will be fully
exculpated from any liability and shall be fully protected and shall not have any liability whatsoever to any
Secured Party as a result of such reliance or the consummation of any Release Action. A Release Certificate
may be delivered in advance of or concurrently with the consummation of any applicable Identified
Transaction.
(d) Each Lender (including in its capacities as a potential Secured Cash Management Bank
and a potential Secured Hedging Counterparty) and each Secured Party irrevocably authorizes and
irrevocably directs the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent to take the Release Actions and
consents to reliance on the Release Certificate. The Secured Parties agree not to give any Agent any
instruction or direction inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 9.11. Neither the Administrative
Agent nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for, or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into, any
statement in a Release Certificate, the compliance of any Identified Transaction with the terms of a Loan
Document, any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral,
the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent&#x2019;s Lien thereon, or contained in any certificate
prepared or delivered by any Loan Party in connection with the Collateral or compliance with the terms set
forth above or in a Loan Document, nor shall the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent be responsible
or liable to the Lenders for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
(e) Each Agent, each Lender (including in its capacities as a potential Secured Cash
Management Bank and a potential Secured Hedging Counterparty) and each other Secured Party agrees
that following the receipt by the Agents of an applicable Release Certificate each Agent will take all Release
Actions promptly upon request of the Borrower and in any event not later than the date that is (i) the one
Business Day following the date Release Certificate is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (ii) the
date any applicable Identified Transaction described in the Release Certificate is consummated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this Section 9.11 shall relieve or release any Loan Party
from any liability resulting from a Default or Event of Default that results from an Identified Transaction
or misrepresentation or omission in any Release Certificate.
(f) Anything contained in any of the Loan Documents to the contrary notwithstanding, each
Agent, each Lender (including in its capacities as a potential Secured Cash Management Bank and a
potential Secured Hedging Counterparty) and each Secured Party hereby agree that in the event of a
foreclosure or similar enforcement action by the Collateral Agent on any of the Collateral pursuant to a
public or private sale or other disposition (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 363(k),
Section 1129(b)(2)(a)(ii) or otherwise of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code), only the Collateral Agent (except with

Lender or Lenders in its or their respective individual capacities), shall be entitled, upon instructions from
the Required Lenders, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price

Obligations owed to it as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral payable by the
Collateral Agent at such sale or other disposition.</font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g089.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 83 -
Section 9.12 Erroneous Payments.
(a) If the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender or Secured Party, or any Person who has
received funds on behalf of a Lender or Secured Party (any such Lender, Secured Party or other recipient
other than a Loan Party, a &#x201C;Payment Recipient&#x201D;) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole
reasonable discretion that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by,
such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment Recipient) (any such funds, whether
received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise,
individually and collectively, an &#x201C;Erroneous Payment&#x201D;) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment
(or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative
Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent, and such Payment Recipient shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business
Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent, in same day funds (in the currency so received), the
amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof), together with interest thereon in respect of
each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such
Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with prevailing
banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby
waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with
respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Erroneous
Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on &#x201C;discharge for value&#x201D; or
any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(b) Without limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Payment Recipient hereby
further agrees that if it receives an Erroneous Payment from the Administrative Agent (or any of its
Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of
payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Erroneous Payment
(the &#x201C;Payment Notice&#x201D;), or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice sent by the
Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), then, said Payment Recipient shall be on notice, in each
case, that an error has been made with respect to such Erroneous Payment. Each Payment Recipient agrees
that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) may
have been sent in error, such Payment Recipient shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such
occurrence and, upon demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than
one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment
(or portion thereof) in same day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect
of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such
Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with prevailing
banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.
(c) Each Payment Recipient hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and
apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Payment Recipient under any Loan Document, or
otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Payment Recipient from any source,
against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under any of the immediately preceding clauses (a) or
(b) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower
or any Loan Party shall continue to be deemed to have performed its payment obligations with respect to
any amount subject to such set-off, netting or application pursuant to the preceding sentence.</font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g090.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 84 -
(d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the
Administrative Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent (such unrecovered
amount, an &#x201C;Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency&#x201D;), such Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay,
repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party,
except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such
Erroneous Payment that is, (i) comprised of funds of the Borrower or any other Loan Party or (ii) the
proceeds of realization from the enforcement of one or more of the Security Documents against or in respect
of the Borrower or one or more of the Loan Parties for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment;
provided however the foregoing shall not apply if all or any portion of the Erroneous Payment. includes
funds of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries in an amount
in excess of the amounts authorized or approved by the Borrower or any Loan Party for such payment, in
which case the Administrative Agent shall immediately commence actions in accordance with this Section
9.12 to recover the Erroneous Payment (or, if applicable, the portion of the Erroneous Payment that was
not authorized by the Borrower or any other Loan Party). For the avoidance of doubt, no assignment of an
Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency will reduce the Commitments of any Payment Recipient and such
Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each
party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion
thereof) acquired pursuant to the assignment of an Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency, and irrespective
of whether the Administrative Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be
contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Payment Recipient under the Loan
Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency.
(e) Each party&#x2019;s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.12 shall survive
the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the
replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.
Section 9.13 Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedging Agreements.
Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein or in any Guaranty or any Security Document, no Secured
Cash Management Bank or Secured Hedging Counterparty that obtains the benefits of Section 8.03, any
Guaranty or any Collateral by virtue of the provisions hereof or of any Guaranty or any Security Document
shall have any right to notice of any action or to consent to, direct or object to any action hereunder or under
any other Loan Document or otherwise in respect of the Collateral or any Guaranty (including the release or
impairment of any Collateral or Guaranty) other than in its capacity as a Lender and, in such case, only to
the extent expressly provided in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article
X to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to verify the payment of, or that other
satisfactory arrangements have been made with respect to, cash management obligations or Obligations
arising under Secured Hedging Agreements.

and act upon any notices (including telephonic or electronic Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on
behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete
or were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as
understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs,
expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or
on behalf of the Borrower in accordance with Section 10.04(b). All telephonic notices to and other

Section 10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in exercising, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Loan Document preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers
and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document,
the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall be vested
exclusively in, and all actions and proceedings at law or in equity in connection with such enforcement
shall be instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent or (with respect to the Security
Documents) the Collateral Agent in accordance with Section 8.02 and/or Section 9.11 for the benefit of all
the Secured Parties and no Lender or other Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon
any of the Collateral or to enforce the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or enforce
rights or remedies thereunder, it being understood and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under
this Agreement and under any of the other Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, for the benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof, and all powers, rights and remedies under the Security Documents may be
exercised solely by the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms
thereof and each Secured Party agrees to commence, support or participate in actions or proceedings relating
to the Obligations only in a manner consistent with the foregoing provisions; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit (i) the Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and
remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, (ii) any Lender from exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08
(subject to the terms of Section 2.11), or (iii) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or appearing and filing
pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to the Borrower under any Debtor
Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then the Required Lenders shall have the rights otherwise
ascribed to the Administrative Agent or (with respect to the Security Documents) the Collateral Agent
pursuant to Section 8.02 and/or Section 9.11.
Each Lender and other Secured Party agrees that it shall not, and hereby waives any right
to, take or institute any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any such right or remedy under
any Loan Document against any Loan Party or any past, present, or future Subsidiary of any Loan Party
concerning any Collateral, or any other property of any Loan Party or any past, present or future Loan Party
other than through the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, this sentence may be enforced against any Secured Party by the Required Lenders, any
Agent or any Borrower (or any of its Affiliates) and each Lender and other Secured Party expressly
acknowledge that this sentence shall be available as a defense of any Borrower (or any of its Affiliates) in
any such action, proceeding or remedial procedure. Each Lender and/or Secured Party, whether or not a
party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and of the Guarantees of the

thereof.
(ii)To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no Agent, Lender or other

Section 10.05 Marshaling; Payments Set Aside. None of the Administrative Agent, Collateral
Agent nor any Lender shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of any Loan Party or any
other Person or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. To the extent that any payment
by or on behalf of the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the Administrative
Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part
thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including
pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent or such Lender in its discretion) to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law or otherwise, then (i) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended
to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made
or such setoff had not occurred, and (ii) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made

(A) No such assignment shall be made (1) to the Borrower or any of the
Borrower&#x2019; respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (2) to any Defaulting Lender or any of their
respective subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would
constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in this clause (B), (3) to a natural person
or (4) absent the written consent of the Borrower (which consent may be given or withheld
at the Borrower&#x2019;s sole discretion), to any Person that was an Ineligible Assignee as of the
applicable Trade Date. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any assignee that
becomes an Ineligible Assignee after the Trade Date applicable to its assignment (including
as a result of the delivery of a notice pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period
referred to in, the proviso to the definition of &#x201C;Ineligible Assignee&#x201D;), (i) such assignee shall
not retroactively be disqualified from having become a Lender pursuant to such assignment
and (ii) such assignee will become an Ineligible Assignee in accordance with the definition
thereof notwithstanding the consummation of such assignment and the execution by the
Borrower of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assignment to an assignee that is or becomes an
Ineligible Assignee (including any assignment in violation of clause (b)(v)(A)(4)) shall not
be void, but the provisions of paragraph (f) below shall apply;
(B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Loan Documents, the
Administrative Agent (solely in its capacity as such) shall not be responsible or have any
liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance by
the Lenders (other than the Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Lender) with the
provisions of this Agreement relating to Ineligible Assignees; provided that the
Administrative Agent shall provide appropriate cooperation to effect Section 10.06(f).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (solely in its
capacity as such) shall not (x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether
any Lender or prospective Lender is an Ineligible Assignee or (y) have any liability with
respect to or arising out of any assignment of Loans, or disclosure of confidential
information by the Lenders (other than the Administrative Agent in its capacity as a
Lender), to any Ineligible Assignee.
(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights
and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment will be effective unless
and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment
make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient,
upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee
of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the
written consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro-rata share of
Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the
applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all

Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be
released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption
covering all of the assigning Lender&#x2019;s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease
to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04
with respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided,
that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting
Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender&#x2019;s
having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at their expense) shall execute and deliver
a Note to the assignee Lender.
(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent&#x2019;s Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant
to the terms hereof from time to time (the &#x201C;Register&#x201D;). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural person, a
Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower&#x2019;s respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
&#x201C;Participant&#x201D;) in all or a portion of such Lender&#x2019;s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including
in each case all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender&#x2019;s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible
to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender&#x2019;s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt: each Lender shall be
responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall
provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or
instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, waiver or other modification described in clause (y) of the first proviso to Section 10.01 that
affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 as if it were a Lender (subject to the requirements and limitations therein,
including the requirements under Section 3.01 (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation)); provided that such Participant
(A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as if it were a Lender and had acquired
its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 10.06 and (B) shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or 3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender
from whom it acquired the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent
such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant
acquired the applicable participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower&#x2019;s
request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions
of Section 3.06 and 10.13 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided that such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender.

register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated
interest) of each Participant&#x2019;s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the
&#x201C;Participant Register&#x201D;); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of
the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a
Participant&#x2019;s interest in any Commitment or Loan or any of its other obligations under any Loan Document)
to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment,
Loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such
Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no
responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.
(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all
or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of
such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as
a party hereto.
(f) Certain Provisions Pertinent to Ineligible Assignees. If any assignment is made to any
Ineligible Assignee or any Affiliate of an Ineligible Assignee without the Borrower&#x2019;s prior consent in
violation of paragraph (b)(v)(D) above, or if any Lender becomes an Ineligible Assignee or is an Affiliate
of an Ineligible Assignee after the Trade Date of the applicable assignment to such Lender, the Borrower
may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to the applicable Ineligible Assignee or such Affiliate and
the Administrative Agent, (A) terminate the Commitment of such Ineligible Assignee or such Affiliate and
repay all obligations of the Borrower owing to such Ineligible Assignee of such Affiliate in connection with
such Commitment and/or (B) require such Ineligible Assignee or such Affiliate to assign and delegate,
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 10.06), all of
its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement and related Loan Documents to an Eligible
Assignee that shall assume such obligations at a purchase price equal to the lesser of (x) the principal
amount thereof and (y) the amount that such Ineligible Assignee or such Affiliate paid to acquire such
interests, rights and obligations, in each case plus accrued interest, accrued fees and all other amounts (other
than principal amounts) payable to such Ineligible Assignee or such Affiliate hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents without premium, penalty, prepayment fee, breakage; provided that (i) the Borrower shall
have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in 10.06(b) and (ii) such
assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) Ineligible
Assignees or any Affiliate of any Ineligible Assignee that are Lenders will not (A) have any inspection
rights or the right to receive information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (B) attend or participate in meetings attended by the Lenders
and the Administrative Agent or (C) access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential
communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders and
(ii)(A) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver or modification of, or any action under, and
for the purpose of any direction to the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or

Debtor Relief Laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the applicable class has
accepted or rejected such Plan of Reorganization in accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code (or any similar provision in any other Debtor Relief Laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any
party for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of competent jurisdiction)
effectuating the foregoing clause (2).
The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Borrower hereby expressly
authorize the Administrative Agent, (i) to provide the list of Ineligible Assignees provided by the Borrower
and any updates thereto from time to time (collectively, the &#x201C;Ineligible Institution List&#x201D;) to any Lender
requesting the same and (ii) post a notice that an update to the Ineligible Institution List has occurred;
provided that the Ineligible Institution List or the content of any update thereto shall not be posted to the
Platform or otherwise made generally available to Lenders.
Section 10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative
Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (i) to its Affiliates and to its and its Affiliates&#x2019;
respective managers, administrators, trustees, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors and

of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (ii) to
the extent requested by any governmental or regulatory agency or authority purporting to have jurisdiction
over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance

examination conducted by bank accountants or any governmental agency, securities or bank regulatory
authority exercising examination or regulatory authority) and provided that it shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that any such information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment, (iii)
to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, in which
case it agrees to inform the Borrower promptly thereof prior to disclosure to the extent practicable and not

accountants or any governmental agency, securities or bank regulatory authority exercising examination or
regulatory authority) and provided that it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any such

Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in connection with the administration of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, and the Commitments, in each case, subject to confidentiality
agreements consistent with this Section 10.07. For purposes of this Section, &#x201C;Information&#x201D; means all
information delivered by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses, including the identity of Ineligible Assignees.
Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential
information.
Each of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that
(i) the Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower or a Subsidiary,
as the case may be, (ii) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material non-public
information and (iii) it will handle such material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law,
including United States Federal and state securities Laws.
Section 10.08 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time with the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at
any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Loan Party, excluding any custodial, trust or special reserve
accounts, against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower, now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
although such obligations of any Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office
or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated
on such indebtedness; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of
setoff, (x) all amounts so set off will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further
application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12(a) and, pending such payment, will be
segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the
Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting
Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its Affiliates under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its
Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify any relevant Loan Party and the Administrative Agent
promptly after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such setoff and application.
Section 10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the
maximum rate of non-usurious interest permitted by applicable Law (the &#x201C;Maximum Rate&#x201D;). If the
Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the
excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded
to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (i) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than
interest, (ii) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (iii) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the
Obligations hereunder.</font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g104.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 98 -
Section 10.10 Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents may
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other electronic imaging means
(e.g. &#x201C;pdf&#x201D; or &#x201C;tif&#x201D;) shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. This
Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,
relating to the subject matter hereof. The words &#x201C;execution,&#x201D; &#x201C;execute,&#x201D; &#x201C;signed,&#x201D; &#x201C;signature,&#x201D; and words
of like import in or related to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment
terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping
of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the
extent and as provided for in any applicable requirements of Law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records
Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
Section 10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and warranties
made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or
in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Collateral
Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain
unpaid or unsatisfied.
Section 10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (i) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and
(ii) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the
foregoing provisions of this Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in
this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good
faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not
so limited.
Section 10.13 Replacement of Lenders. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant
to the provisions of Section 3.06 or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender, then
the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights (other than its
existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and
the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may
be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:

specified in Section 10.06(b);</font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g105.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">- 99 -

principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it

Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation

(iv) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
(v) in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment,
waiver or consent.
Other than in the case of any Lender that is or was a Defaulting Lender, a Lender shall not
be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation

transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any amendment, waiver or other modification
hereof or of any other Loan Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its
Affiliates&#x2019; understanding, that: (i)(A) the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement provided
by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders, are arm&#x2019;s-length

its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they have deemed appropriate, and (C)
the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understand and accept, the terms, risks and conditions of the

Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed
into law October 26, 2001)) (the &#x201C;Act&#x201D;), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information that
will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance

Obligation Currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery results in the effective receipt by the
Administrative Agent or a Lender of the full amount of the Obligation Currency expressed to be payable to
it under this Agreement or another Loan Document. If, for the purpose of obtaining or enforcing judgment
against the Borrower in any court or in any jurisdiction, it becomes necessary to convert into or from any
currency other than the Obligation Currency (such other currency being hereinafter referred to as the
&#x201C;Judgment Currency&#x201D;) an amount due in the Obligation Currency, the conversion shall be made, at the rate
of exchange (as quoted by the Administrative Agent or if the Administrative Agent does not quote a rate of
exchange on such currency, by a known dealer in such currency designated by the Administrative Agent)
determined, in each case, as of the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the judgment is
given (such Business Day being hereinafter referred to as the &#x201C;Judgment Currency Conversion Date&#x201D;).
(b) If there is a change in the rate of exchange prevailing between the Judgment Currency
Conversion Date and the date of actual payment of the amount due, the Borrower covenants and agrees to
pay, or cause to be paid, or remit, or cause to be remitted, such additional amounts, if any (but in any event
not a lesser amount), as may be necessary to ensure that the amount paid in the Judgment Currency, when
converted at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, will produce the amount of the
Obligation Currency which could have been purchased with the amount of Judgment Currency stipulated
in the judgment or judicial award at the rate of exchange prevailing on the Judgment Currency Conversion
Date.
(c) For purposes of determining any rate of exchange or currency equivalent for this
Section 10.19, such amounts shall include any premium and costs payable in connection with the purchase
of the Obligation Currency.

of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution
that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of

Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of
the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.

Excluded Swap Obligations) or Secured Cash Management Agreements ( (all such monetary and other
obligations referred to in clauses (x) and (y) above being herein collectively referred to as the
&#x201C;Guaranteed Obligations&#x201D;).
(b) The books and records of the Administrative Agent showing the amount of the
Guaranteed Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding
upon each Guarantor and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations.
(c) Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the
obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal to the
greatest amount that would not render such Guarantor&#x2019;s obligations hereunder subject to avoidance as a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any
provisions of applicable state law (collectively, the &#x201C;Fraudulent Transfer Laws&#x201D;), in each case after giving
effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the
Fraudulent Transfer Laws (specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (i) in respect
of intercompany indebtedness to any Other Loan Party or any of its Affiliates to the extent that such
indebtedness would be discharged or would be subject to a right of set-off in an amount equal to the
amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (ii) under any guaranty of Debt subordinated in right of
payment to the Guaranteed Obligations which guaranty contains a limitation as to a maximum amount
similar to that set forth in this paragraph pursuant to which the liability of such Guarantor hereunder is
included in the liabilities taken into account in determining such maximum amount) and after giving
effect as assets of such Guarantor to the value (as determined under the applicable provisions of the
Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or
similar rights of such Guarantor pursuant to (i) applicable Law or (ii) any agreement providing for an
equitable allocation among such Guarantor and any Other Loan Party and its Affiliates of obligations
arising under guaranties by such parties (including the agreements in Article III of this Agreement). If any
Guarantor&#x2019;s liability hereunder is limited pursuant to this paragraph to an amount that is less than the total
amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, then it is understood and agreed that the portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations for which such Guarantor is liable hereunder shall be the last portion of the Guaranteed
Obligations to be repaid.
Section 2.02 Guaranty Absolute. Each Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed
Obligations will be paid and performed strictly in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents,
regardless of any Law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of the Secured Parties with respect thereto. The obligations of each Guarantor under this
Agreement are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Other Loan Parties, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Agreement,
irrespective of whether any action is brought against any Other Loan Party or whether any Other Loan
Party is joined in any such action or actions. This Agreement is an absolute and unconditional guaranty
of payment when due, and not of collection, by each Guarantor, jointly and severally with each other
Guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations in each and every particular. The obligations of each Guarantor
hereunder are several from those of the Other Loan Parties and are primary obligations concerning which
each Guarantor is the principal obligor. The Secured Parties shall not be required to mitigate damages or
take any action to reduce, collect or enforce the Guaranteed Obligations.
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction,
limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, including the existence of any claim, set-off or other
right which any Guarantor may have at any time against any Other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent,
any Secured Party or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor&#x2019;s liability shall extend to all amounts that </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g146.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">-4-
constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by any Other Loan Party to any Secured
Party under the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the
existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving any Other Loan Party.
Each Guarantor has irrevocably and unconditionally delivered this Agreement to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and the failure by any Other Loan Party or
any other Person to sign this Agreement or a guaranty similar to this Agreement or otherwise shall not
discharge the obligations of any Guarantor hereunder. The irrevocable and unconditional liability of each
Guarantor hereunder applies whether it is jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of the
Guaranteed Obligations, or only for a pro-rata portion, and without regard to any rights (or the
impairment thereof) of subrogation, contribution or reimbursement that such Guarantor may now or
hereafter have against any Other Loan Party or any other Person. This Agreement is and shall remain
fully enforceable against each Guarantor irrespective of any defenses that any Other Loan Party may have
or assert in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations, including, without limitation, failure of consideration,
breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury,
except that a Guarantor may assert the defense of final payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations.
Section 2.03 Payments.
(a) Payments to be Made Upon Default. If the Borrower or any Guarantor fails to
pay or perform any Guaranteed Obligation when due in accordance with its terms (whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) or if any Default or Event of Default specified in Section 8.01(f)
of the Credit Agreement occurs with respect to the Borrower or any Guarantor, the Guarantors shall,
promptly following demand by the Administrative Agent, fully and punctually pay and perform each of
the Guaranteed Obligations to the Administrative Agent.
(b) General Provisions as to Payments. Each payment hereunder shall be made free
and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff, at
the Administrative Agent&#x2019;s Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Guarantor shall make all payments hereunder in accordance with Section 2.10 of the
Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this paragraph shall survive the payment in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Agreement.
(c) Application of Payments. All payments received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall be applied as provided in Section 8.03 of the Credit Agreement.
Section 2.04 Discharge; Reinstatement in Certain Circumstances. Each Guarantor&#x2019;s

any set-off or appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or in payment
of the Guaranteed Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release or otherwise affect the liability
of any Guarantor hereunder, it being understood that each Guarantor shall, notwithstanding any such
payment or payments, remain liable for the Guaranteed Obligations until the Discharge of Finance
Obligations. If at any time any payment by any Other Loan Party or any other Person of any Guaranteed
Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy,
dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Other Loan Party or other Person or upon or as a result of
the appointment of a receiver, intervener or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, such Other
Loan Party or other Person or any substantial part of its respective property or otherwise, this Agreement
and each Guarantor&#x2019;s obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as though
such payment had been due but not made at such time. Each Guarantor party hereto agrees that payment
or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or other acts which toll any statute of limitations
applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations shall also toll the statute of limitations applicable to each such
Guarantor&#x2019;s liability hereunder.

payment from and protest to the Other Loan Parties of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, and also waives
promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance of its guarantee, any other notice with respect to any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and this Agreement and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any
other Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property subject thereto. Each
Guarantor further waives any right to require that resort be had by the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party to any security held for payment of the Guaranteed Obligations or to any balance of any
deposit, account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in favor of
the Borrower, Guarantor or any other Person. Each Guarantor hereby consents and agrees to each of the
following to the fullest extent permitted by Law, and agrees that such Guarantor&#x2019;s obligations under this
Agreement shall not be released, diminished, impaired, reduced or adversely affected by any of the
following, and waives any rights (including rights to notice) which such Guarantor might otherwise have
as a result of or in connection with any of the following:
(i) any renewal, extension, modification, increase, decrease, alteration or
rearrangement of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument executed in
connection therewith, or any contract or understanding with any Other Loan Party, the
Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party, or any of them, or any other Person, pertaining to
the Guaranteed Obligations;
(ii) any adjustment, indulgence, forbearance or compromise that might be
granted or given by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to any Other Loan Party
or any other Person liable on the Guaranteed Obligations; or the failure of the Administrative
Agent or any other Secured Party to assert any claim or demand or to exercise any right or
remedy against any Other Loan Party under the provisions of any Loan Document or otherwise;

provisions of, any Loan Document or any other agreement, including with respect to any Other
Loan Party under this Agreement;

Guaranteed Obligations, or any document or agreement executed in connection with the
Guaranteed Obligations, for any reason whatsoever, including the fact that the Guaranteed
Obligations, or any part thereof, exceed the amount permitted by Law, the act of creating the
Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof is ultra vires, the officers or representatives executing
the documents or otherwise creating the Guaranteed Obligations acted in excess of their authority,

defenses, claims or offsets (whether at law, in equity or by agreement) which render the
Guaranteed Obligations wholly or partially uncollectible from such Other Loan Party, the
creation, performance or repayment of the Guaranteed Obligations (or the execution, delivery and
performance of any document or instrument representing part of the Guaranteed Obligations or
executed in connection with the Guaranteed Obligations or given to secure the repayment of the
Guaranteed Obligations) is illegal, uncollectible, legally impossible or unenforceable, or the
documents or instruments pertaining to the Guaranteed Obligations have been forged or otherwise

(v) any full or partial release of the liability of any Other Loan Party or of
any other Person now or hereafter liable, whether directly or indirectly, jointly, severally, or
jointly and severally, to pay, perform, guarantee or assure the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations or any part thereof, it being recognized, acknowledged and agreed by each Guarantor
that such Guarantor may be required to pay the Guaranteed Obligations in full without assistance
or support of any other Person, and such Guarantor has not been induced to enter into this
Agreement on the basis of a contemplation, belief, understanding or agreement that any party
other than the Borrower will be liable to perform the Guaranteed Obligations, or that the Secured
Parties will look to any other party to perform the Guaranteed Obligations;
(vi) the taking or accepting of any other security, collateral or guarantee, or
other assurance of payment, for all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations;
(vii) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any other Secured Party or any
other Person to exercise diligence or reasonable care in the preservation, protection, enforcement,

Loan Party or someone else;

Guaranteed Obligations, whether or not such action or omission prejudices any Guarantor or
increases the likelihood that any Guarantor will be required to pay the Guaranteed Obligations
pursuant to the terms hereof, it being the unambiguous and unequivocal intention of each
Guarantor that such Guarantor shall be obligated to pay the Guaranteed Obligations when due,
notwithstanding any occurrence, circumstance, event, action or omission whatsoever, whether or
not contemplated, and whether or not otherwise or particularly described herein, except for the

operation of Law, including by way of a discharge, limitation or tolling thereof under applicable
Debtor Relief Laws;

may have at any time against any Other Loan Party, the Administrative Agent, any other Secured
Party or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated transactions; provided
that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory
counterclaim; or
(xii) any other circumstance that might in any manner or to any extent
otherwise constitute a defense available to, vary the risk of, or operate as a discharge of, such
Guarantor as a matter of Law or equity other than the final payment in full of the Guaranteed
Obligations.
All waivers herein contained shall be without prejudice to the right of the Administrative Agent at its
option to proceed against the Borrower, any Guarantor or any other Person, whether by separate action or
by joinder.
Section 2.06 Agreement to Pay; Subordination of Subrogation Claims. In furtherance
of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent or any other
Secured Party has at law or in equity against any Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Other
Loan Party to pay any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at
maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, each Guarantor hereby promises to and
will forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent or such other Secured Party as
designated thereby in cash the amount of such unpaid Guaranteed Obligations. Upon payment by any
Guarantor of any sums to the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party as provided above, all
rights of such Guarantor against any Other Loan Party arising as a result thereof by way of right of
subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise shall (including, without limitation, any
rights of a Guarantor arising under Article III of this Agreement) in all respects be subordinate and junior
in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of all the Guaranteed Obligations and
Discharge of Finance Obligations. No failure on the part of any Other Loan Party or any other Person to
make any payments in respect of any subrogation, contribution, reimbursement, indemnity or similar right
(or any other payments required under applicable Law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the
obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor with respect to its obligations hereunder. If any amount shall
erroneously be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation, contribution, reimbursement,
indemnity or similar right, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Secured Parties and
shall forthwith be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the exact form received by such Guarantor
(duly endorsed by such Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, if required) to be credited against the
payment of the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of
the Loan Documents.
Section 2.07 Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of any
amount payable by any Other Loan Party under or with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed
upon the insolvency or bankruptcy of such Other Loan Party, all such amounts otherwise subject to
acceleration under the terms of the Credit Agreement, any Note or any other agreement or instrument
evidencing or securing the Guaranteed Obligations shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors
hereunder, jointly and severally, forthwith on demand by the Administrative Agent.

Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to enforce any right, power or benefit under this
Agreement, and no set-off, claim, reduction or diminution of any Guaranteed Obligation or any defense of
any kind or nature which any Guarantor has or may have against any Other Loan Party or any Secured
Party shall be available against the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party in any suit or action
brought by the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to enforce any right, power or benefit
provided for by this Agreement other than a defense of payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations;
provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion by any Guarantor of any such claim by separate
suit or compulsory counterclaim. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver by any
Guarantor of any rights or claims which it may have against any Secured Party hereunder or otherwise,
but any recovery upon such rights and claims shall be had from such Secured Party separately, it being
the intent of this Agreement that each Guarantor shall be unconditionally, absolutely and jointly and
severally obligated to perform fully all its obligations, covenants and agreements hereunder for the benefit
of each Secured Party.
ARTICLE III
INDEMNIFICATION, SUBROGATION AND CONTRIBUTION
Section 3.01 Indemnity and Subrogation. In addition to all such rights of indemnity
and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable Law (but subject to Section 2.01(d), 2.01(e)
and Section 2.06 above), each Guarantor agrees that if a payment shall be made by any other Guarantor
under this Agreement, it shall indemnify such other Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and
such other Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the person to whom such payment shall have
been made to the extent of such payment.
Section 3.02 Contribution and Subrogation. Each Guarantor (a &#x201C;Contributing
Guarantor&#x201D;) agrees (subject to Section 2.01(d), 2.01(e) and Section 2.06 above) that, if a payment shall be
made by any other Guarantor under this Agreement to satisfy a claim of any Secured Party and such other
Guarantor (the &#x201C;Claiming Guarantor&#x201D;) shall not have been fully indemnified by any Guarantor as
provided in Section 3.01, the Contributing Guarantor shall indemnify the Claiming Guarantor in an
amount equal to the amount of such payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of
such assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the
net worth of the Contributing Guarantor on the date that the obligation(s) supporting such claim were
incurred under this Agreement and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate net worth of all the
Guarantors on such date. Any Contributing Guarantor making any payment to a Claiming Guarantor
pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Guarantor under Section
3.01 to the extent of such payment, in each case subject to the provisions of Section 2.06.

Adverse Effect or (B) any order, injunction, writ or decree of any Governmental Authority or any arbitral

delivered hereunder, will have been, duly executed and delivered by each Guarantor. This Agreement
constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which it is a party when so delivered will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor enforceable against such Guarantor in accordance
with its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by statutes of limitations, bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium or other Laws affecting creditors&#x2019; rights generally,

Loan Documents), and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding

of information known to it or any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
Section 4.03 Subordination by Guarantors. In addition to the terms of subordination
provided for under Section 2.06, each Guarantor hereby subordinates in right of payment all indebtedness

acquired by such Guarantor by assignment, transfer or otherwise, whether now owed or hereafter arising,
whether for principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, together with all renewals, extensions,
increases or rearrangements thereof, to the prior indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed
Obligations, whether now owed or hereafter arising, whether for principal, interest (including interest
accruing during the pendency of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, regardless of whether allowed
or allowable in such proceeding), fees, expenses or otherwise, together with all renewals, extensions,
increases or rearrangements thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until such time as the Administrative
Agent shall have exercised any remedy pursuant to Section 8.02 of the Credit Agreement (or the principal
amount of the Loans shall have become automatically due and payable pursuant to the proviso thereof),
the Guarantors shall be permitted to make payments on any such indebtedness so long as such
indebtedness is otherwise permitted or not restricted pursuant to the Credit Agreement.
ARTICLE V
SET-OFF
Section 5.01 Right of Set-Off. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted

any Event of Default under the Credit Agreement, each Secured Party (and each of its Affiliates) is
authorized at any time and from time to time, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind (all of such rights being hereby expressly waived), to set off and to appropriate and apply any and all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) and any other indebtedness at any time
held or owing by such Secured Party (including, without limitation, branches, agencies or Affiliates of
such Secured Party wherever located) to or for the credit or account of any Guarantor against obligations
and liabilities of such Guarantor then due to the Secured Parties hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, and any such set-off shall be deemed to have been made immediately upon the occurrence of
an Event of Default even though such charge is made or entered on the books of such Secured Party
subsequent thereto. Each Guarantor hereby agrees that to the extent permitted by law any Person
purchasing a participation in a Loan or a Note whether or not acquired pursuant to the arrangements
provided for in Section 10.06 of the Credit Agreement, may exercise all rights of set-off with respect to its
participation interest as fully as if such Person were a Secured Party.

such consent shall be void). Upon the assignment by the Administrative Agent or any Secured Party of
all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement (including all or any portion of
its Commitments and the Loans owing to it) or any other Loan Document to any other Person permitted
under the Credit Agreement, such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in
respect thereof granted to such transferor or assignor herein or otherwise.
Section 6.03 No Waivers; Non-Exclusive Remedies. No failure or delay on the part
of the Administrative Agent or any other Secured Party to exercise, no course of dealing with respect to,
and no delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or other document or agreement contemplated hereby or thereby shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
provided herein and in the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights
or remedies provided by Law.
Section 6.04 Enforcement. The Secured Parties agree that this Agreement may be
enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent (acting upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders if required under the Loan Documents) and that no other Secured Party shall have any right
individually to seek to enforce this Agreement, it being understood and agreed that such rights and
remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties upon the
terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit (i) any Lender from
exercising setoff rights in accordance with Section 5.01 or (ii) any Lender from filing proofs of claim or
appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of a proceeding relative to the
Guarantors under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided, further, that if at any time there is no Person
acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then in addition to the
matters set forth in the preceding proviso and subject to the Credit Agreement, any Lender may, with the
consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and remedies available to it and as authorized by the
Required Lenders.
Section 6.05 Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by each
Guarantor directly affected by such amendment or waiver (it being understood that the addition or release
of any Guarantor hereunder shall not constitute an amendment or waiver affecting any Guarantor other </font></p></td></tr></table></div><div style="margin-left:2.6515151515151%;margin-right:2.65151515151515%;page-break-after:always;" ><div style="background-color:#000000;clear:both;height:2pt;border:0;margin:30pt 0pt 30pt 0pt;"></div></div><div align="center"><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style="width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;"><tr style="page-break-inside:avoid;"><td width="92.3%" valign="top" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:92.3%;"><p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;"><img src="mdwt-20221231xex10d34g154.jpg" alt="GRAPHIC"></p></td><td width="7.7%" valign="middle" style="padding:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;width:7.7%;"><p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="1" color="white" face="Arial" style="color:white;font-size:1.0pt;">-12-

SOLVENCY CERTIFICATE
November [&#x25CF;], 2022
This Solvency Certificate (this &#x201C;Certificate&#x201D;) is being executed and delivered pursuant to Section 5(b)(iv)
of that certain Credit Agreement, dated as of November 22, 2022, by and among MIDWEST HOLDING
INC., a Delaware corporation (the &#x201C;Borrower&#x201D;), the Lenders, and ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, as
Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Credit Agreement.
The undersigned, solely in such undersigned&#x2019;s capacity as Chief Financial Officer of the Borrower,
and not in any individual capacity and without personal liability, hereby certifies to the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Loan Parties, as follows:
1. The undersigned is familiar with the business and financial position of the Loan Parties, taken as a
whole and is duly authorized to execute this Solvency Certificate on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to the
Credit Agreement.
2. Immediately after giving effect to transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement:
(A) the fair value of the property of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis,
is greater than the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis;
(B) the present fair saleable value of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability on
the debts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, as they become absolute
and matured in the ordinary course of business;
(C) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to, and do not
believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their ability, on a consolidated basis, to pay
such debts and liabilities as they mature in the ordinary course of business; and
(D) the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not engaged in a business or a transaction, and are
not about to engage in a business or transaction, for which the capital of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small in relation to the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, contemplated as of the date
hereof.

REMEDIAL PROVISIONS
Section 5.1 Code and Other Remedies.

and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to any Secured Obligation, all
rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC or any other applicable Law.
(b) Disposition of Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral
Agent may, without demand of performance or other demand, presentment, protest, advertisement or notice
of any kind (except any notice required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other
Person (all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby waived to the
extent permitted by applicable Law), upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default (personally or through its agents or attorneys), (i) to the extent lawful and permitted enter upon the
premises where any Collateral is located for a reasonable period, without any obligation to pay rent, through
self- help, without judicial process, without first obtaining a final judgment or giving any Grantor or any
other Person notice or opportunity for a hearing on the Collateral Agent&#x2019;s claim or action, (ii) collect,
receive, appropriate and realize upon any Collateral, (iii) with respect to any Collateral consisting of
Intellectual Property, on demand, to cause the Security Interest to become an assignment, transfer and
conveyance of any of or all such Collateral by the applicable Grantor to the Collateral Agent, or to license
or sublicense, whether general, special or otherwise, and whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis,
any such Collateral throughout the world on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the Collateral
Agent shall determine (other than in violation of any then-existing licensing arrangements to the extent that
waivers cannot be obtained), and (iv) sell, assign, convey, transfer, grant option or options to purchase and
deliver any Collateral (or enter into Contractual Obligations to do any of the foregoing), in one or more
parcels at public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker&#x2019;s board or office of any Secured Party or

prior notice of such disposition (which each Grantor agrees is reasonable notice within the meaning of
Section 9-611 of the UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions). The Collateral Agent shall be authorized
at any such sale (if it deems it advisable to do so) to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons
who will represent and agree that they are purchasing the Collateral for their own account for investment
and not with a view to the distribution or sale thereof, and upon consummation of any such sale the
Collateral Agent shall have the right to assign, transfer and deliver to the purchaser or purchasers thereof
the Collateral so sold. The Collateral Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale of any Collateral if it
shall determine not to do so, regardless of the fact that notice of sale of such Collateral shall have been
given. Any Secured Party shall have the right, upon any such public sale or sales and, to the extent permitted
by the UCC and other applicable Law, upon any such private sale, to purchase the whole or any part of the
Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption of any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby
waived and released, and may make payment on account thereof by using any claim then due and payable
to such Secured Party from any Grantor as a credit against the purchase price and such Secured Party may,
upon compliance with the terms of sale, hold, retain and dispose of such property without further
accountability to any Grantor therefor. As an alternative to exercising the power of sale herein conferred
upon it, the Collateral Agent may proceed by a suit or suits at law or in equity to foreclose on and to sell
the Collateral or any portion thereof pursuant to a judgment or decree of a court or courts having competent
jurisdiction or pursuant to a proceeding by a court appointed receiver. Any sale pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 6.1(b) shall be deemed to conform to the commercially reasonable standards as provided in
Section 9-610(b) of the UCC or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.
(c) Management of the Collateral. Each Grantor agrees, that, upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any Event of Default, (i) it shall assemble the Collateral and make it available to the
Collateral Agent at places that the Collateral Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor&#x2019;s
premises or elsewhere, (ii) without limiting the foregoing, the Collateral Agent also has the right to require
that each Grantor store and keep any Collateral pending further action by the Collateral Agent and, while
any such Collateral is so stored or kept, provide such guards and maintenance services as shall be reasonably
necessary to protect the same and to preserve and maintain such Collateral in good condition, (iii) until the
Collateral Agent is able to sell, assign, convey or transfer any Collateral, the Collateral Agent shall have
the right to hold or use such Collateral to the extent that it deems appropriate for the purpose of preserving
the Collateral or its value or for any other purpose deemed appropriate by the Collateral Agent and (iv) the
Collateral Agent may, if it so elects, seek the appointment of a receiver or keeper to take possession of any
Collateral and to enforce any of the Collateral Agent&#x2019;s remedies (for the benefit of the Secured Parties),
with respect to such appointment without prior notice or hearing as to such appointment. The Collateral
Agent shall not have any obligation to any Grantor to maintain or preserve the rights of any Grantor as
against third parties with respect to any Collateral while such Collateral is in the possession of the Collateral
Agent.
(d) Application of Proceeds. The Collateral Agent shall apply the cash proceeds of any action
taken by it pursuant to this Section 5.1 as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and only after such application
and after the payment by the Collateral Agent of any other amount required by any applicable Law, need
the Collateral Agent account for the surplus, if any, to any Grantor. It is understood and agreed that the
Grantors shall remain jointly and severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the
proceeds of the Collateral and the aggregate amount of the Secured Obligations.
(e) Remedies Generally. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any other Secured Party shall be
required to make any demand upon, or pursue or exhaust any right or remedy against, any Grantor or any
other Person with respect to the payment of the Obligations or to pursue or exhaust any right or remedy
with respect to any Collateral therefor. All of the rights and remedies of the Collateral Agent and any other
Secured Party under any Loan Document shall be cumulative, may be exercised individually or

extent it may lawfully do so, each Grantor absolutely and irrevocably waives and relinquishes the benefit
and advantage of, and covenants not to assert against the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party, any
valuation, stay, appraisement, extension, redemption or similar laws and any and all rights or defenses it
may have as a surety, now or hereafter existing, arising out of the exercise by them of any rights hereunder.
If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition of any Collateral shall be required by law, such notice
shall be deemed reasonable and proper if given at least ten (10) days before such sale or other disposition.
(f) IP Licenses. For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent to exercise rights and
remedies under this Section 5.1 and during the continuance of any Event of Default (including in order to
take possession of, collect, receive, assemble, process, appropriate, remove, realize upon, sell, assign,
convey, transfer or grant options to purchase any Collateral), at such time as the Collateral Agent shall be
lawfully entitled to exercise such rights and remedies, each Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent,
for the benefit of the Secured Parties and to the extent of such Grantor&#x2019;s rights therein and to the extent
permitted by the applicable licenses or other agreements related thereto, an irrevocable, nonexclusive,
worldwide license (exercisable only during the continuance of an Event of Default and without payment of
royalty or other compensation to such Grantor) to, use and practice and sublicense any Intellectual Property
included in the Collateral now owned or hereafter acquired by such Grantor, including access to all media
in which any of the licensed items may be recorded or stored and to all Software and programs used for the
compilation or printout thereof (in each case to the extent that such Grantor is permitted to grant such
license and access under the applicable licenses or other agreements related thereto).
(g) Insurance Regulatory Approval. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
foreclosure or exercise of remedies with respect to any Collateral (including exercise of voting rights with
respect to, or the transfer of, any Pledged Equity Interests) shall be subject to the prior written consent and
approval of the Applicable Insurance Regulatory Authority to the extent required by applicable Law.
Section 5.2 Accounts and Payments in Respect of General Intangibles.
(a) In addition to, and not in substitution for, any similar requirement in the Credit Agreement,
at any time upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payment of accounts
or payment in respect of general intangibles that constitute Collateral, when collected by any Grantor, shall
be promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days) deposited by such Grantor in the exact form
received, duly indorsed by such Grantor to the Collateral Agent, in a cash collateral account, subject to
withdrawal by the Collateral Agent as provided in Section 5.4.
(b) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor shall remain liable under
each account and each payment in respect of general intangibles to observe and perform all the conditions
and obligations to be observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any
agreement giving rise thereto. No Secured Party shall have any obligation or liability under any agreement
giving rise to an account or a payment in respect of a general intangible by reason of or arising out of any
Loan Document or the receipt by any Secured Party of any payment relating thereto, nor shall any Secured
Party be obligated in any manner to perform any obligation of any Grantor under or pursuant to any
agreement giving rise to an account or a payment in respect of a general intangible, to make any payment,
to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or as to the sufficiency
of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or file any claim, to take any action to enforce any
performance or to collect the payment of any amounts that may have been assigned to it or to which it may
be entitled at any time or times.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
the Collateral Agent or its nominee may, upon prior written notice from the Collateral Agent, exercise (i)
any voting, consent, corporate and other right pertaining to the Pledged Securities at any meeting of
shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, of the relevant issuer or issuers of Pledged Securities
and (ii) any right of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other right, privilege or option
pertaining to the Pledged Securities as if it were the absolute owner thereof (including the right to exchange
at its discretion any Pledged Securities upon the merger, amalgamation, consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or equivalent structure of any issuer of
Pledged Equity Interests, the right to deposit and deliver any Pledged Securities with any committee,
depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the
Collateral Agent may determine and the right to cause the Pledged Securities to be registered in the name

actually received by it; provided, however, that the Collateral Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to
exercise any such right, privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in
so doing.
(b) Proxies. In order to permit the Collateral Agent to exercise the voting and other consensual
rights that it may be entitled to exercise pursuant hereto and to receive all dividends and other distributions
that it may be entitled to receive hereunder, (i) each Grantor shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause
to be executed and delivered) to the Collateral Agent all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other
instruments as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request in writing and (ii) without
limiting the effect of clause (i) above, such Grantor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent, subject to the
notice requirements of Section 5.3(a), an irrevocable proxy to vote all or any part of the Pledged Securities
and to exercise all other rights, powers, privileges and remedies to which a holder of the Pledged Securities
would be entitled (including giving or withholding written consents of shareholders, partners or members,
as the case may be, calling special meetings of shareholders, partners or members, as the case may be, and
voting at such meetings), which proxy shall be effective subject to the limitations on the exercise thereof
set forth in this Agreement, automatically and without the necessity of any action (including any transfer
of any Pledged Securities on the record books of the issuer thereof) by any other Person (including the
issuer of such Pledged Securities or any officer or agent thereof) provided that the Collateral Agent shall
only be entitled to exercise such proxy upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default and which proxy shall terminate upon the occurrence of the Commitments expiring or being
terminated and all Obligations (other than Obligations under Secured Hedging Agreements, Secured Cash
Management Agreements and contingent obligations for which no claim has been asserted) having been
paid in full.

Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Credit Agreement or this Agreement, upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all proceeds of any Collateral received by
any Grantor hereunder in cash or cash equivalents shall be held by such Grantor for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties, and shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from the
Collateral Agent by any Grantor, be turned over to the Collateral Agent in the exact form received (with
any necessary endorsement). All such proceeds of Collateral and any other proceeds of any Collateral
received by the Collateral Agent in cash or cash equivalents shall be held by the Collateral Agent in a cash
collateral account. All proceeds being held by the Collateral Agent in a cash collateral account (or by such
Grantor in trust for the Collateral Agent) shall continue to be held as collateral security for the Secured
Obligations and shall not constitute payment thereof until applied as provided in the Credit Agreement.

any Pledged Securities by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state
or foreign securities laws or otherwise or may determine that a public sale is impracticable, not desirable
or not commercially reasonable and, accordingly, may resort to one or more private sales thereof to a
restricted group of purchasers that shall be obliged to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities
for their own account for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each Grantor
acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices and other terms less favorable than
if such sale were a public sale and, notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale
shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Collateral Agent shall be
under no obligation to delay a sale of any Pledged Securities for the period of time necessary to permit the
issuer thereof to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act or under applicable state
securities laws even if such issuer would agree to do so. The Collateral Agent shall incur no responsibility
or liability for selling all or any part of the Pledged Securities at a price that the Collateral Agent, in its sole
and absolute discretion, may deem reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding the possibility that
a substantially higher price might have been realized if the sale were deferred until after registration as
aforesaid or if more than a limited number of purchasers (or a single purchaser) were approached. The
provisions of this Section 5.5 will apply notwithstanding the existence of a public or private market upon
which the quotations or sales prices may exceed substantially the price at which the Collateral Agent sells
any Pledged Security.
(b) Each Grantor agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done
all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of any portion of the Pledged Securities
pursuant to Section 5.1 and this Section 5.5 valid and binding and in compliance with all applicable Law.
Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any covenant contained in this Section5.5 will cause
irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent and other Secured Parties, that the Collateral Agent and the other
Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in respect of such breach and, as a consequence, that each
and every covenant contained in this Section 5.5 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and
such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defense against an action for specific performance
of such covenants except for a defense that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the
Credit Agreement or (ii) a defense of the occurrence of the Commitments expiring or being terminated and
all Obligations (other than Obligations under Secured Hedging Agreements, Secured Cash Management
Agreements and contingent obligations for which no claim has been asserted) having been paid in full.
Each Grantor waives any and all rights of contribution or subrogation upon the sale or disposition of all or
any portion of the Pledged Securities by Collateral Agent until the occurrence of the Commitments expiring
or having been terminated and all Obligations (other than Obligations under Secured Hedging Agreements,
Secured Cash Management Agreements and contingent obligations for which no claim has been asserted)
having been paid in full.
Section 5.6 Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of
any sale or other disposition of any Collateral are insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations and the fees
and disbursements of any attorney employed by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party to collect
such deficiency.

Section 6.2 Duty; Obligations and Liabilities.
(a) Each Grantor acknowledges that the rights and responsibilities of the Collateral Agent under
this Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Collateral Agent or the exercise or non-exercise by the
Collateral Agent of any option, voting right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or
resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties,
be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with respect thereto as may exist from time
to time among them, but, as between the Collateral Agent and the Grantors, the Collateral Agent shall be
conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Secured Parties with full and valid authority so to act or
refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall be under any obligation or have any entitlement to make any inquiry
respecting such authority.
(b) Each Grantor hereby appoints the Collateral Agent as the attorney-in-fact of such Grantor,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, for the purpose of carrying out the
provisions of this Agreement and taking any action and executing any instrument that the Collateral Agent
may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment is irrevocable and
coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Collateral Agent shall have
the right, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, with full power of
substitution either in the Collateral Agent&#x2019;s name or in the name of such Grantor (a) to receive, endorse,
assign and/or deliver any and all notes, acceptances, checks, drafts, money orders or other evidences of
payment relating to the Collateral or any part thereof, (b) to demand, collect, receive payment of, give
receipt for and give discharges and releases of all or any of the Collateral, (c) to sign the name of any
Grantor on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any of the Collateral, (d) to send verifications of accounts
receivable to any account debtor, (e) to commence and prosecute any and all suits, actions or proceedings
at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect or otherwise realize on all or any of the
Collateral or to enforce any rights in respect of any Collateral, (f) to settle, compromise or defend any
actions, suits or proceedings relating to all or any of the Collateral, (g) to notify, or to require any Grantor
to notify, account debtors to make payment directly to the Collateral Agent, and (h) to use, sell, assign,
transfer, pledge, make any agreement with respect to or otherwise deal with all or any of the Collateral, and
to do all other acts and things necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, as fully and completely as though the Collateral Agent were the absolute owner of the Collateral for
all purposes; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring or obligating
the Collateral Agent to make any commitment or to make any inquiry as to the nature or sufficiency of any
payment received by the Collateral Agent, or to present or file any claim or notice, or to take any action
with respect to the Collateral or any part thereof or the moneys due or to become due in respect thereof or
any property covered thereby. The Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties shall be accountable only
for amounts actually received as a result of the exercise of the powers granted to them herein, and neither
they nor their officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for any act or
failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith as finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(c) Duty of Collateral Agent. The Collateral Agent&#x2019;s sole duty with respect to the custody,
safekeeping and physical preservation of the Collateral in its possession shall be to deal with it in the same
manner as a reasonably prudent Person would deal with similar property for its own account. The powers

Party to exercise any such powers. The other Secured Parties shall be accountable only for amounts that
they actually receive as a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their respective

transferred of record into the name of the Collateral Agent or the name of its nominee (as pledgee or as sub-agent) and (b) the Collateral Agent shall have the right to exchange the certificates representing the Pledged
Securities for certificates of smaller or larger denominations for any purpose consistent with this Agreement

contained in this Agreement shall be construed to make the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party
liable as a member of any limited liability company or as a partner of any partnership and neither the
Collateral Agent nor any other Secured Party by virtue of this Agreement or otherwise (except as referred
to in the following sentence) shall have any of the duties, obligations or liabilities of a member of any
limited liability company or as a partner in any partnership. The parties hereto expressly agree that, unless
the Collateral Agent shall become the absolute owner of Pledged Equity Interests consisting of a limited
liability company interest or a partnership interest pursuant hereto, this Agreement shall not be construed
as creating a partnership or joint venture among the Collateral Agent, any other Secured Party, any Grantor
and/or any other Person.
ARTICLE VII.
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 7.1 Release of Collateral.
(a) Upon the occurrence of a Lien Release Event, the Liens created by this Agreement with
respect to the applicable Collateral of the applicable Grantor(s) shall be automatically released to the extent
provided in Section 9.11(a) of the Credit Agreement, and, in the case of the release of all of the Collateral
granted by any Grantor(s) upon the occurrence of a Guaranty Release Event or if such Grantor is otherwise
released from its obligations under its Guaranty pursuant to the Credit Agreement, all rights obligations of
such Grantor(s) and the Collateral Agent (solely with respect to such Grantor(s)) shall terminate, and in the
case of a release of all of the Collateral of all of the Grantors when the Commitments have expired or been
terminated and all Obligations (other than Obligations under Secured Hedging Agreements, Secured Cash
Management Agreements and contingent obligations for which no claim has been asserted) have been paid
in full, this Agreement shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument or performance of any act by

At the
written request of any Grantor following any such termination, the Collateral Agent shall promptly deliver
to such Grantor any Collateral of such Grantor held by the Collateral Agent hereunder and execute and
deliver to such Grantor such documents or take such actions as such Grantor shall reasonably request to
evidence or effectuate such termination.
(b) If the Collateral Agent shall be directed or permitted pursuant to Section 9.11 of the Credit
Agreement to release any Lien on any Collateral, such Collateral shall be released from the Lien created
hereby to the extent provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in, such section. In
connection therewith, the Collateral Agent, at the written request of any Grantor, shall execute and deliver
to such Grantor such documents or take such actions as such Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence
or further effectuate such release following the receipt by the Collateral Agent of the Release Certificate in
respect of such release.
(c) At the time provided in Section 9.11 of the Credit Agreement, the applicable Grantor shall
be released from its obligations hereunder; and the Collateral Agent, at the written request of such Grantor,
shall execute and deliver to such Grantor such releases or other documents or take such actions reasonably
requested by such Grantor to evidence or effectuate such release following the receipt by the Collateral
Agent of the Release Certificate in respect of such release.
Any execution and delivery of documents pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall be without recourse to
or warranty by the Collateral Agent.
Section 7.2 Independent Obligations. The obligations of each Grantor hereunder are
independent of and separate from the Secured Obligations. If any Secured Obligation is not paid when due,
or upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Collateral Agent may, at
its sole election, proceed directly and at once, without notice, against any Grantor and any Collateral to
collect and recover the full amount of any Secured Obligation then due, without first proceeding against
any other Grantor or any other Collateral and without first joining any other Grantor in any proceeding.
Section 7.3 No Waiver by Course of Conduct. No Secured Party shall by any act (except by a
written instrument pursuant to Section 7.4), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have
waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of Default. No failure
to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any Secured Party, any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. A waiver by any Secured Party of any right or remedy hereunder on any one occasion shall not
be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such Secured Party would otherwise have on any future
occasion. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges herein provided, and provided under each other Loan
Document, are cumulative and independent of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of any Loan, the provision of any Cash
Management Services or the provision of services under any Secured Hedging Agreement shall not be
construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
Section 7.4 Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this Agreement may
be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in accordance with Section 10.01 of the
Credit Agreement; provided, however, that schedules and annexes to this Agreement may be supplemented
(but no existing provisions may be modified and no Collateral may be released) through Joinders to Security
Agreement, in substantially the form of Annex 1, in each case duly executed by the Collateral Agent and
each Grantor directly affected thereby.

obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent.
