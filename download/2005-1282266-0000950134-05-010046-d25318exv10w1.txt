            (b) Changes in GAAP. If at any time any change in GAAP would affect
the computation of any financial ratio or requirement set forth in any Loan
Document, and the Loan Party Representative or the Required Lenders shall so
request, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and Holdings shall negotiate in
good faith to amend such ratio or requirement to preserve the original intent
thereof in light of such change in GAAP (subject to the approval of the Required
Lenders); provided that, until so amended, (i) such ratio or requirement shall

                                       46
<PAGE>

continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such change therein and
(ii) the Loan Parties shall provide to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
financial statements and other documents required under this Agreement or as
reasonably requested hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between
calculations of such ratio or requirement made before and after giving effect to
such change in GAAP.

            (c) Consolidated Parties. Any reference made in this Agreement or
any other Loan Document to any consolidated financial statement or statements of
the Consolidated Parties means such financial statement or statements prepared
on a combined basis for the Consolidated Parties pursuant to GAAP and accounting
for any Unrestricted Subsidiary on an unconsolidated basis as investments, not
utilizing the equity method.

      SECTION 1.04 ROUNDING. Any financial ratios required to be maintained by
the Consolidated Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by
dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result
to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is expressed
herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a
rounding-up if there is no nearest number).

      SECTION 1.05 TIMES OF DAY. Unless otherwise specified, all references
herein to times of day shall be references to Eastern time (daylight or
standard, as applicable).

      SECTION 1.06 LETTER OF CREDIT AMOUNTS. Unless otherwise specified herein,
the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated
amount of such Letter of Credit in effect at such time; provided, however, that
with respect to any Letter of Credit that by its terms or the terms of any
Issuer Document related thereto, provides for one or more automatic increases in
the stated amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed
to be the maximum stated amount of such Letter of Credit after giving effect to
all such increases, whether or not such maximum stated amount is in effect at
such time.

                                   ARTICLE II
                        COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS

      SECTION 2.01 TERM LOANS AND REVOLVING LOANS. (a) (i) Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, each Tranche B Term Lender severally agrees to
make a single loan, or pursuant to a timely Conversion Notice delivered in
accordance with clause (ii) below, elect to convert all or a portion of such
Lender's existing Tranche B Term Loans under the Existing Senior Credit
Agreement into a loan under this Agreement (each such loan, a "Tranche B Term
Loan") to the Borrower on the Closing Date and in an aggregate amount, not to
exceed such Tranche B Term Lender's Tranche B Term Commitment on the Closing
Date. Each Tranche B Term Borrowing by the Borrower made on the Closing Date
shall consist of Tranche B Term Loans made to the Borrower simultaneously by the
Tranche B Term Lenders ratably according to their Tranche B Term Commitments.
Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(a) and repaid or prepaid may not be
reborrowed.

                  (i) In connection with the making of the Tranche B Term Loans
      pursuant to clause (i) above, by delivering irrevocable written notice (a
      "Conversion Notice") to the Administrative Agent (in such form as the
      Administrative Agent may

                                       47
<PAGE>

      reasonably request) on or prior to the Closing Date, each and every lender
      under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement which has confirmed its Tranche
      B Term Commitment pursuant to such Conversion Notice is hereby offered the
      opportunity to convert, and may elect to convert all or a portion of the
      outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loans (as such terms
      are defined in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) held by such lender
      into Tranche B Term Loans hereunder in a principal amount equal to the
      amount of the Tranche B Term Loans so converted (each such Tranche B Term
      Loan to the extent it is to be so converted, a "Converted Loan") and such
      Converted Loans shall be treated for all purposes hereunder as applying
      towards such lender's Tranche B Term Loans requested by the Borrower to be
      made on the Closing Date pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.01(a).

                  (ii) On the Closing Date, the Converted Loans shall be
      converted for all purposes of this Agreement into Tranche B Term Loans,
      and the Administrative Agent shall record in the Register the aggregate
      amount of Converted Loans converted into Tranche B Term Loans. Any
      Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent delivered by any lender
      under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement pursuant to this Section shall
      confirm the amount of such lender's Tranche B Term Commitment and the
      principal amount of Loans under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement held
      by such lender that are to be converted into Tranche B Term Loans.
      Delivery of a duly executed Conversion Notice shall obviate the need for
      any lender under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement delivering such a
      notice with respect to Converted Loans equal to all its Tranche B Term
      Commitments to execute this Agreement and such Conversion Notice shall be
      deemed for all purposes to be a signature to this Agreement. In addition,
      the Administrative Agent may append to this Agreement a supplement to
      Schedule 2.01 showing all Lenders holding Tranche B Term Loans on the
      Closing Date and indicating the amount thereof and whether such Lenders
      made or converted the Tranche B Term Loans on the Closing Date.

            (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
initial Tranche C Term Lender agrees to continue a portion of its Tranche C Term
Loans (as that term is defined in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) as a
loan hereunder (a "Tranche C Term Loan") to the Borrower on the Closing Date and
in an aggregate amount not to exceed such Tranche C Term Lender's Tranche C Term
Commitment on the Closing Date. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(b) and
repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

            (c) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
initial Tranche D Term Lender agrees to continue a portion of its Tranche D Term
Loans (as that term is defined in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) as a
loan hereunder (a "Tranche D Term Loan") to the Borrower on the Closing Date and
in an aggregate amount not to exceed such Tranche D Term Lender's Tranche D Term
Commitment on the Closing Date. Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.01(c) and
repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

            (d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each
Revolving Lender severally agrees to make loans (each such loan, a "Revolving
Loan") to the Borrower from time to time, on any Business Day during the
Availability Period for Revolving Loans, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at
any time outstanding the amount of such Revolving

                                       48
<PAGE>

Lender's Revolving Commitment; provided, however, that after giving effect to
any Revolving Borrowing, (i) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed
the Revolving Commitments, and (ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the
Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender, plus such Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations plus, such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall
not exceed such Lender's Revolving Commitment. Within the limits of each
Revolving Lender's Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions
hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01(d), prepay under Section
2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.01(d).

            (e) Revolving Loans and Tranche B Term Loans may be Base Rate Loans
or Eurodollar Rate Loans, and Tranche C Term Loans and Tranche D Term Loans may
be RTFC Fixed Rate Loans or RTFC Variable Rate Loans, as further provided
herein.

      SECTION 2.02 BORROWINGS, CONVERSIONS AND CONTINUATIONS OF LOANS.

            (a) Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the
other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans
shall be made upon the Borrower's or the Loan Party Representative's irrevocable
notice to the Administrative Agent and, if such Loan is being converted to
either a RTFC Fixed Rate Loan or a RTFC Variable Rate Loan, to the RTFC, which
may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent, and if applicable, the RTFC, not later than 11:00 a.m. (i)
three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion
to, or continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Loans or of any conversion of Eurodollar
Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans, (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans, (iii) five Business Days prior to the requested date of any
Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of RTFC Fixed Rate Loans or
conversion of RTFC Fixed Rate Loans to RTFC Variable Rate Loans and (iv) one
Business Day prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of RTFC Variable Rate
Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Loan Party Representative pursuant to this
Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative
Agent and the RTFC, if applicable, of a written Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Loan Party Representative.
Each conversion of RTFC Variable Rate Loans to RTFC Fixed Rate Loans and each
continuation of RTFC Fixed Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period shall be
effective only with the written consent of the Tranche C Term Lenders or the
Tranche D Term Lenders affected by such conversion or continuation. Each
Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof. Except as provided in Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c), each Borrowing of
or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or
a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice (whether
telephonic or written) shall specify (A) whether the Borrower or the Loan Party
Representative is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to
the other, or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans,
(B) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case
may be (which shall be a Business Day), (C) the principal amount of Loans to be
borrowed, converted or continued, (D) the Facility and the Type of Loans under
such Facility to be borrowed or to which existing Loans under such Facility are
to be converted or continued, and (E) if applicable, the duration of the
Interest Period with respect thereto. In the case of the Revolving Facility or
the Tranche B Term Facility, if the

                                       49
<PAGE>

Borrower or the Loan Party Representative fails to specify a Type of Loan in a
Loan Notice, or if the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative fails to give a
timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation of Loans under any such
Facility or if a Default has occurred and is continuing, then the applicable
Loans under such Facility shall be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. In
the case of Tranche C Term Loans and Tranche D Term Loans, if the Borrower or
the Loan Party Representative fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan Notice,
or if the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative fails to give timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation of Loans under any such Facility or if a
Default has occurred and is continuing or if the affected Tranche C Term Lenders
or Tranche D Term Lenders do not consent to any requested conversion of RTFC
Variable Rate Loans to RTFC Fixed Rate Loans or to any continuation of RTFC
Fixed Rate Loans for an additional Interest Period, then the applicable Loans
under such Facility shall be made as, or converted to, RTFC Variable Rate Loans.
Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or RTFC Variable Rate Loans, as
applicable, shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in
effect with respect to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate
Loans. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of a Default, the
obligation of the Lenders to make, continue or convert Loans into Eurodollar
Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans shall be suspended. If the Borrower or the
Loan Party Representative requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or
continuation of, Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to
specify an Interest Period, the Borrower will be deemed to have specified an
Interest Period of one month.

            (b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice in respect of a Facility, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender under such Facility of
the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and if no
timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Loan Party
Representative, the Administrative Agent shall notify each applicable Lender of
the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans or RTFC Variable Rate
Loans described in the preceding subsection (a). In the case of a Borrowing,
each applicable Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the
Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Administrative
Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in the
applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth
in Section 4.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension, Section
4.01), the Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to
the Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i)
crediting an account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the
amount of such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in
accordance with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the
Administrative Agent by the Loan Party Representative; provided, however, that
if, on the date a Loan Notice with respect to a Revolving Borrowing is given by
the Loan Party Representative, there are Swing Line Loans or L/C Borrowings
outstanding, then the proceeds of such Revolving Borrowing shall be applied,
first, to the payment in full of any such L/C Borrowings, and second, to the
payment in full of any such Swing Line Loans, and third, to the Borrower as
provided above.

            (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan and
RTFC Fixed Rate Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an
Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate Loan or RTFC Fixed Rate Loan, as
applicable. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as,
converted to, or continued as, Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans
without the consent of the Required Lenders.

                                       50
<PAGE>

            (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Loan Party
Representative and the applicable Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any
Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon determination of such interest
rate. At any time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent
shall notify the Loan Party Representative and the applicable Lenders of any
change in Bank of America's prime rate used in determining the Base Rate
promptly following the public announcement of such change. As applicable, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Loan Party Representative and the
applicable Lenders of the applicable rate, if any, furnished by RTFC, after
consultation by the Administrative Agent with RTFC as to its then current
applicable policies and procedures.

            (e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans
from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type,
there shall not be more than ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to
Revolving Loans, ten Interest Periods in effect with respect to Tranche B Term
Loans, three Interest Periods in effect with respect to Tranche C Term Loans and
two Interest Periods in effect with respect to Tranche D Term Loans.

            (f) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make any Loan to be
made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

      SECTION 2.03 LETTERS OF CREDIT.

            (a) The Letter of Credit Commitment.

                  (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (A)
      the L/C Issuer agrees, in reliance upon the agreements of the Revolving
      Lenders set forth in this Section 2.03, (1) from time to time on any
      Business Day during the period from the Closing Date until the Letter of
      Credit Expiration Date, to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the
      Borrower, and to amend Letters of Credit previously issued by it, in
      accordance with subsection (b) below, and (2) to honor drafts under the
      Letters of Credit, and (B) the Revolving Lenders severally agree to
      participate in Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower;
      provided that after giving effect to any L/C Credit Extension with respect
      to any Letter of Credit, (x) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not
      exceed the Revolving Commitments, (y) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of
      the Revolving Loans of any Revolving Lender, plus such Revolving Lender's
      Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations
      plus such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding
      Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Revolving Lender's
      Revolving Commitment, and (z) the Outstanding Amount of the L/C
      Obligations shall not exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit. Each request
      by the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative for the issuance or
      amendment of a Letter of Credit for the account of the Borrower shall be
      deemed a representation by the Borrower that the L/C Credit Extension so
      requested complies with the conditions set forth in the proviso to the
      preceding sentence. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the terms
      and conditions hereof, the Borrower's ability to obtain Letters of Credit
      shall be fully revolving, and accordingly the Borrower

                                       51
<PAGE>

      may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace
      Letters of Credit that have expired or that have been drawn upon and
      reimbursed.

                  (ii)  The L/C Issuer shall not issue any Letter of Credit, if:

                        (A) subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), the expiry date of
            such requested Letter of Credit would occur more than twelve months
            after the date of issuance or last renewal, unless the Required
            Revolving Lenders have approved such expiry date; or

                        (B) the expiry date of such requested Letter of Credit
            would occur after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, unless all
            the Revolving Lenders have approved such expiry date.

                  (iii) The L/C Issuer shall not be under any obligation to
      issue any Letter of Credit if:

                        (A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental
            Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or
            restrain the L/C Issuer from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any
            Law applicable to the L/C Issuer or any request or directive
            (whether or not having the force of law) from any Governmental
            Authority with jurisdiction over the L/C Issuer shall prohibit, or
            request that the L/C Issuer refrain from, the issuance of letters of
            credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall
            impose upon the L/C Issuer with respect to such Letter of Credit any
            restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which the L/C
            Issuer is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the
            Closing Date, or shall impose upon the L/C Issuer any unreimbursed
            loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date
            and which the L/C Issuer in good faith deems material to it;

                        (B) except as otherwise agreed by the Administrative
            Agent and the L/C Issuer, such Letter of Credit is in an initial
            stated amount less than $50,000;

                        (C) such Letter of Credit is denominated in a currency
            other than Dollars; or

                        (D) a default of any Lender's obligations to fund under
            Section 2.03(c) exists or any Lender is at such time a Defaulting
            Lender hereunder, unless the L/C Issuer has entered into
            satisfactory arrangements with the Borrower to eliminate the L/C
            Issuer's risk with respect to such Lender.

                  (iv) The L/C Issuer shall not amend any Letter of Credit if
      the L/C Issuer would not be permitted at such time to issue such Letter of
      Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof.

                  (v) The L/C Issuer shall be under no obligation to amend any
      Letter of Credit if (A) the L/C Issuer would have no obligation at such
      time to issue such Letter of

                                       52
<PAGE>

      Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof, or (B) the beneficiary
      of such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment to such
      Letter of Credit.

                  (vi) The L/C Issuer shall act on behalf of the Revolving
      Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the
      documents associated therewith, and the L/C Issuer shall have all of the
      benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Administrative Agent in
      Article X with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by the L/C
      Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be
      issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as
      fully as if the term "Administrative Agent" as used in Article X included
      the L/C Issuer with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as
      additionally provided herein with respect to the L/C Issuer.

            (b) Procedures for Issuance and Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto
Extension Letters of Credit.

                  (i) Each Letter of Credit shall be issued or amended, as the
      case may be, upon the request of the Borrower or the Loan Party
      Representative delivered to the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the
      Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit Application,
      appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
      Borrower or the Loan Party Representative on behalf of the Borrower. Such
      Letter of Credit Application must be received by the L/C Issuer and the
      Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. at least two Business Days
      (or such later date and time as the L/C Issuer may agree in a particular
      instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed issuance date or
      date of amendment, as the case may be. In the case of a request for an
      initial issuance of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit Application
      shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the L/C Issuer the
      following: (A) the proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of
      Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (B) the amount thereof; (C) the
      expiry date thereof; (D) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof;
      (E) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any
      drawing thereunder; (F) the full text of any certificate to be presented
      by such beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (G) such other
      matters as the L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request
      for an amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of
      Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to the
      L/C Issuer the following: (A) the Letter of Credit to be amended; (B) the
      proposed date of amendment thereof (which shall be a Business Day); (C)
      the nature of the proposed amendment; and (D) such other matters as the
      L/C Issuer may reasonably require.

                  (ii) Promptly after receipt of any Letter of Credit
      Application, the L/C Issuer will confirm with the Administrative Agent (by
      telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy
      of such Letter of Credit Application from the Borrower or the Loan Party
      Representative and, if not, the L/C Issuer will provide the Administrative
      Agent with a copy thereof. Unless the L/C Issuer has received written
      confirmation from any Revolving Lender, the Administrative Agent or any
      Loan Party, at least one Business Day prior to that the requested issuance
      or amendment of the applicable Letter of Credit, that one or more of the
      applicable conditions contained in Article IV shall not have been
      satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the L/C
      Issuer shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the
      account of the

                                       53
<PAGE>

      Borrower or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be, in
      each case in accordance with the L/C Issuer's usual and customary business
      practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each
      Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
      unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the L/C Issuer a risk
      participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product
      of such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such
      Letter of Credit.

                  (iii) If the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative so
      requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer
      may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of
      Credit that has automatic extension provisions (each, an "Auto-Extension
      Letter of Credit"); provided that any such Auto-Extension Letter of Credit
      must permit the L/C Issuer to prevent any such extension at least once in
      each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such
      Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not
      later than a day (the "Non-Extension Notice Date") in each such
      twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is
      issued. Unless otherwise directed by the L/C Issuer, neither the Borrower
      nor the Loan Party Representative shall be required to make a specific
      request to the L/C Issuer for any such extension. Once an Auto-Extension
      Letter of Credit has been issued, the Revolving Lenders shall be deemed to
      have authorized (but may not require) the L/C Issuer to permit the
      extension of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later
      than the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided, however, that the L/C
      Issuer shall not permit any such extension if (A) the L/C Issuer has
      determined that it would not be permitted, or would have no obligation, at
      such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its revised form (as extended)
      under the terms hereof (by reason of the provisions of clause (ii) or
      (iii) of Section 2.03(a) or otherwise), or (B) it has received notice
      (which may be by telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is
      five Business Days before the Non-Extension Notice Date (1) from the
      Administrative Agent that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not
      to permit such extension or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any
      Revolving Lender or the Loan Party Representative that one or more of the
      applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, and
      in each such case directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such extension.

                  (iv) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or
      any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect
      thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, the L/C Issuer will also deliver to
      the Loan Party Representative and the Administrative Agent a true and
      complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment.

                  (v) If the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative so
      requests in any applicable Letter of Credit Application, the L/C Issuer
      may, in its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of
      Credit that permits the automatic reinstatement of all or a portion of the
      stated amount thereof after any drawing thereunder (each, an
      "Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit"). Unless otherwise directed by the
      L/C Issuer, neither the Borrower nor the Loan Party Representative shall
      be required to make a specific request to the L/C Issuer to permit such
      reinstatement. Once an Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit has been
      issued, except as provided in the following sentence, the Revolving
      Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the L/C
      Issuer to

                                       54
<PAGE>

      reinstate all or a portion of the stated amount thereof in accordance with
      the provisions of such Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      each Auto-Reinstatement Letter of Credit shall permit the L/C Issuer to
      decline to reinstate all or any portion of the stated amount thereof after
      a drawing thereunder by giving notice of such non-reinstatement within a
      period of time (which shall not be less than 10 days) after such drawing
      (the "Non-Reinstatement Deadline"), and the L/C Issuer shall not permit
      such reinstatement if (A) it has received a notice (which may be by
      telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is five Business Days
      before the Non-Reinstatement Deadline (1) from the Administrative Agent
      that the Required Revolving Lenders have elected not to permit such
      reinstatement or (2) from the Administrative Agent, any Revolving Lender
      or the Loan Party Representative that one or more of the applicable
      conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied (treating such
      reinstatement as an L/C Credit Extension for purposes of this clause) and,
      in each case, directing the L/C Issuer not to permit such reinstatement or
      (B) it has not been reimbursed for such drawing prior to the
      Non-Reinstatement Deadline.

            (c) Drawings and Reimbursements; Funding of Participations.

                  (i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit
      of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer
      shall notify the Loan Party Representative and the Administrative Agent
      thereof and shall state the date payment shall be made by the L/C Issuer
      under a Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"). Not later than
      11:00 a.m. on (A) the Honor Date, if either (1) an Event of Default has
      occurred and is continuing, or (2) no Event of Default has then occurred
      and is continuing, and the Loan Party Representative has received such
      notice no later than the Business Day prior to the Honor Date, or (B)
      otherwise, on the Business Day after the Loan Party Representative
      receives such notice, the Borrower shall reimburse the L/C Issuer through
      the Administrative Agent in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing.
      If the Borrower fails to so reimburse the L/C Issuer by such time, the
      Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Lender of the
      Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing on the applicable
      Letter of Credit (the "Unreimbursed Amount"), and the amount of such
      Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof. In such event, the
      Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Revolving Borrowing of Base
      Rate Loans to be disbursed on the Honor Date in an amount equal to the
      Unreimbursed Amount, without regard to the minimum and multiples specified
      in Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject
      to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and
      the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (other than the delivery of a
      Loan Notice). Any notice given by the L/C Issuer or the Administrative
      Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if
      immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an
      immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding
      effect of such notice.

                  (ii) Each Revolving Lender shall upon any notice pursuant to
      Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available to the Administrative Agent for
      the account of the L/C Issuer at the Administrative Agent's Office in an
      amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the Unreimbursed Amount not
      later than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day

                                       55
<PAGE>

      specified in such notice by the Administrative Agent (if such notice is
      delivered not later than 11:00 a.m. on such Business Day, otherwise on the
      next Business Day), whereupon, subject to the provisions of Section
      2.03(c)(iii), each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be
      deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The
      Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the L/C Issuer.

                  (iii) With respect to any Unreimbursed Amount that is not
      fully refinanced by a Revolving Borrowing of Base Rate Loans because the
      conditions set forth in Section 4.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other
      reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the L/C Issuer
      an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the Unreimbursed Amount that is not so
      refinanced, which L/C Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand
      (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In
      such event, each Revolving Lender's payment to the Administrative Agent
      for the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be
      deemed payment in respect of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and
      shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Revolving Lender in satisfaction
      of its participation obligation under this Section 2.03.

                  (iv) Until each Revolving Lender funds its Revolving Loan or
      L/C Advance pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the L/C Issuer
      for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of
      such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such amount shall be
      solely for the account of the L/C Issuer.

                  (v) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans
      or L/C Advances to reimburse the L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under
      Letters of Credit, as contemplated by this Section 2.03(c), shall be
      absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance,
      including (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right
      which such Revolving Lender may have against the L/C Issuer, the
      Administrative Agent, any Loan Party or any other Person for any reason
      whatsoever, (B) in the case of L/C Advances only, the occurrence or
      continuance of a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition,
      whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that
      each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to
      this Section 2.03(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section
      4.02 (other than delivery by the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative
      of a Loan Notice). No such making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or
      otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse the L/C
      Issuer for the amount of any payment made by the L/C Issuer under any
      Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein.

                  (vi) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer any amount required
      to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions
      of this Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in Section 2.03(c)(ii), the
      L/C Issuer shall be entitled to recover from such Revolving Lender (acting
      through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest
      thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date
      on which such payment is immediately available to the L/C Issuer at a rate
      per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate
      determined by the L/C Issuer in accordance with banking industry rules on
      interbank compensation. A certificate of the

                                       56
<PAGE>

      L/C Issuer submitted to any Revolving Lender (through the Administrative
      Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this Section 2.03(c)(vi)
      shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            (d)   Repayment of Participations.

                  (i) At any time after the L/C Issuer has made a payment under
      any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Lender such
      Revolving Lender's L/C Advance in respect of such payment in accordance
      with Section 2.03(c), if the Administrative Agent receives for the account
      of the L/C Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed
      Amount or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or
      otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
      Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to such
      Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof (appropriately
      adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time
      during which such Revolving Lender's L/C Advance was outstanding) in the
      same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

                  (ii) If any payment received by the Administrative Agent for
      the account of the L/C Issuer pursuant to Section 2.03(c)(i) is required
      to be returned under any of the circumstances described in Section 11.05
      (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the L/C Issuer in
      its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative
      Agent for the account of the L/C Issuer its Applicable Percentage thereof
      on demand of the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date
      of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving
      Lender, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to
      time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Lenders under this clause
      shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination
      of this Agreement.

            (e)   Obligations Absolute. The obligation of the Borrower to
reimburse the L/C Issuer for each drawing under each Letter of Credit and to
repay each L/C Borrowing shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

                  (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of such Letter of
      Credit, this Agreement, or any other agreement or instrument relating
      thereto;

                  (ii) the existence of any claim, counterclaim, setoff, defense
      or other right that any Loan Party may have at any time against any
      beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit (or any Person for
      whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the L/C
      Issuer or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
      transactions contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any
      agreement or instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated transaction;

                  (iii) any draft, demand, certificate or other document
      presented under such Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
      invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being
      untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or

                                       57
<PAGE>

      delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order
      to make a drawing under such Letter of Credit;

                  (iv) any payment by the L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit
      against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
      comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the
      L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
      trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of
      creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to
      any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any
      arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law;

                  (v) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral,
      or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to the departure from
      any Guarantee, for all or any of the Obligations of the Borrower in
      respect of any Letter of Credit; or

                  (vi) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether
      or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance
      that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of,
      the Borrower or any Guarantor.

      The Loan Party Representative shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter
of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it, and, in the event
of any claim of noncompliance with the Loan Party Representative's or the
Borrower's instructions or other irregularity, the Loan Party Representative
will promptly (but in any case no later than one Business Day after delivery
thereof) notify the L/C Issuer. The Loan Party Representative shall be
conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against the L/C Issuer and its
correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid.

            (f) Role of L/C Issuer. Each Revolving Lender and the Loan Parties
agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the L/C Issuer shall
not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft,
certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document or the
authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. None of the
L/C Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties
nor any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer shall be liable
to any Revolving Lender for (i) any action taken or omitted in connection
herewith at the request or with the approval of the Revolving Lenders or the
Required Revolving Lenders, as applicable, (ii) any action taken or omitted in
the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (iii) the due
execution, effectiveness, validity or enforceability of any document or
instrument related to any Letter of Credit or Issuer Document. The Borrower
hereby assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit; provided, however,
that this assumption is not intended to, and shall not, preclude the Borrower
pursuing such rights and remedies as the Borrower may have against the
beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of the L/C
Issuer, the Administrative Agent, any of their respective Related Parties nor
any correspondent, participant or assignee of the L/C Issuer, shall be liable or
responsible for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vi) of
Section 2.03(e); provided, however, that anything in such clauses to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Borrower may have a claim against the L/C Issuer,
and the L/C Issuer may be liable to the Borrower, to the

                                       58
<PAGE>

extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or
exemplary, damages suffered by the Borrower which the Borrower proves were
caused by the L/C Issuer's willful misconduct or gross negligence or the L/C
Issuer's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the
presentation to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s)
strictly complying with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the L/C Issuer may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
and the L/C Issuer shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of
any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

            (g) Cash Collateral. Upon the request of the Administrative Agent,
(A) if the L/C Issuer has honored any full or partial drawing request under any
Letter of Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing, or (B) if,
as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for any reason
remains outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, the Borrower shall, in each
case, immediately Cash Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations. Sections 2.05 and 8.02(b) set forth certain additional requirements
to deliver Cash Collateral hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.03, Section
2.05 and Section 8.02(b), "Cash Collateralize" means to pledge and deposit with
or deliver to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and
the Revolving Lenders, as collateral for the L/C Obligations, cash or deposit
account balances pursuant to documentation in form and substance satisfactory to
the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer (which documents are hereby
consented to by the Revolving Lenders). Derivatives of such term have
corresponding meanings. The Borrower hereby grants to the Administrative Agent,
for the benefit of the L/C Issuer and the Revolving Lenders, a security interest
in all such cash, deposit accounts and all balances therein and all proceeds of
the foregoing. Cash Collateral shall be maintained in blocked, non-interest
bearing deposit accounts at Bank of America. Cash Collateral shall be released
as directed by the Loan Party Representative on the Termination Date for all
Loan Parties (or any earlier date prior to the Letter of Credit Expiration Date
as the Administrative Agent shall have determined that all L/C Borrowings have
been refinanced as Borrowings hereunder and no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing).

            (h) Applicability of ISP. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the
L/C Issuer and the Loan Party Representative when a Letter of Credit is issued,
the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit.

            (i) Letter of Credit Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with
its Applicable Percentage a Letter of Credit fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee")
for each Letter of Credit equal to the Applicable Rate for Eurodollar Rate
Revolving Loans times the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under such
Letter of Credit. For purposes of computing the daily amount available to be
drawn under any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
determined in accordance with Section 1.06. Such Letter of Credit Fees shall be
(i) computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and (ii) due and payable on the
last Business Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing with
the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter of Credit, on the
Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. If there is any
change

                                       59
<PAGE>

in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the daily amount available to be
drawn under each Letter of Credit shall be computed and multiplied by the
Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that such
Applicable Rate was in effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
contained herein upon the request of the Required Revolving Lenders, while any
Event of Default exists, all Letter of Credit Fees shall accrue at the Default
Rate.

            (j) Fronting Fee and Documentary and Processing Charges Payable to
L/C Issuer. The Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C Issuer for its own
account a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit, at the rate per
annum equal to 0.25%, computed on the actual daily maximum amount available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then
in effect under such Letter of Credit) and on a quarterly basis in arrears such
fronting fee shall be due and payable on the tenth Business Day after the end of
each March, June, September and December in respect of the most recently-ended
quarterly period (or portion thereof, in the case of the first payment),
commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter
of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and thereafter on demand. For
purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under any Letter of
Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be determined in accordance
with Section 1.06. In addition, the Borrower shall pay directly to the L/C
Issuer for its own account the customary issuance, presentation, amendment and
other processing fees, and other standard costs and charges in effect on the
date of issuance or request for amendment of a Letter of Credit, as the case may
be, of the L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from time to time in
effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and charges are due and payable
on demand and are nonrefundable.

            (k) Conflict with Letter of Credit Application. In the event of any
conflict between the terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit
Application, the terms hereof shall control.

            (l) Letters of Credit Issued for Restricted Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued or outstanding hereunder for the
account of the Borrower is in support of any obligations of, or otherwise will
benefit, any other Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings, the Borrower shall be
obligated to reimburse the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under
such Letter of Credit. The Borrower hereby acknowledges that the issuance of
Letters of Credit for the benefit of any Restricted Subsidiary of Holdings
inures to the benefit of the Borrower, and that the Borrower's businesses derive
substantial benefits from the businesses of such Restricted Subsidiaries.

      SECTION 2.04 SWING LINE LOANS.

            (a) The Swing Line. The Borrower or the Loan Party Representative
may request on behalf of the Borrower that the Swing Line Lender make, and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line Lender, in
reliance upon the agreements of the other Revolving Lenders set forth in this
Section 2.04 may, if in its sole discretion it elects to do so, make loans (each
such loan, a "Swing Line Loan") to the Borrower from time to time on any
Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate amount not to exceed
at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit, notwithstanding
the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when aggregated with the Applicable
Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of

                                       60
<PAGE>

Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations of the Revolving Lender acting as Swing Line
Lender, may exceed the amount of such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment;
provided, however, that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan, (i) the
Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the Revolving Commitments, and
(ii) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Revolving
Lender, plus such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding
Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such Revolving Lender's Applicable
Percentage of the Outstanding Amount of all Swing Line Loans shall not exceed
such Revolving Lender's Revolving Commitment, and provided further, that the
Borrower shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the
other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrower may borrow under this Section
2.04, prepay under Section 2.05, and reborrow under this Section 2.04. Each
Swing Line Loan shall be a Base Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a
Swing Line Loan, each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a
risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to the product of
such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage times the amount of such Swing
Line Loan.

            (b) Borrowing Procedures. Each Swing Line Borrowing may be made upon
the Borrower's or the Loan Party Representative's irrevocable notice to the
Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.
Each such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date,
and shall specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a minimum of
$100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the
requested borrowing date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic
notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and the
Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice, appropriately
completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Loan Party Representative.
Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any telephonic Swing Line
Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will confirm with the Administrative Agent
(by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has also received
such Swing Line Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the
Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents thereof.
Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by telephone or in writing)
from the Administrative Agent (including at the request of any Revolving Lender)
prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the proposed Swing Line Borrowing (A)
directing the Swing Line Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of
the limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of Section
2.04(a), or (B) that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in
Section 4.02 is not then satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swing Line Lender may, if in its sole discretion it elects to do so,
not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing date specified in such Swing Line Loan
Notice, make the amount of its Swing Line Loan available to the Borrower at its
office by crediting the Borrower's Account or any account of the Borrower
designated on the books of the Swing Line Lender in immediately available funds.

            (c) Refinancing of Swing Line Loans.

                  (i) The Swing Line Lender at any time in its sole and absolute
      discretion may request, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
      irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf),
      that each Revolving Lender make a

                                       61
<PAGE>

      Base Rate Revolving Loan in an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's
      Applicable Percentage of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding.
      Such request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be
      deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance with the
      requirements of Section 2.02, without regard to the minimum and multiples
      specified therein for the principal amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject
      to the unutilized portion of the Revolving Commitments and the conditions
      set forth in Section 4.02. The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Loan
      Party Representative with a copy of the applicable Loan Notice promptly
      after delivering such notice to the Administrative Agent. Each Revolving
      Lender shall make an amount equal to its Applicable Percentage of the
      amount specified in such Loan Notice available to the Administrative Agent
      in immediately available funds for the account of the Swing Line Lender at
      the Administrative Agent's Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day
      specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to Section 2.04(c)(ii),
      each Revolving Lender that so makes funds available shall be deemed to
      have made a Base Rate Revolving Loan to the Borrower in such amount. The
      Administrative Agent shall remit the funds so received to the Swing Line
      Lender.

                  (ii) If for any reason any Swing Line Loan cannot be
      refinanced by such a Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i), the
      request for Base Rate Revolving Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender
      as set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line
      Lender that each of the Revolving Lenders fund its risk participation in
      the relevant Swing Line Loan and each Revolving Lender's payment to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender pursuant to
      Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment in respect of such
      participation.

                  (iii) If any Revolving Lender fails to make available to the
      Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender any amount
      required to be paid by such Revolving Lender pursuant to the foregoing
      provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by the time specified in Section
      2.04(c)(i), the Swing Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such
      Revolving Lender (acting through the Administrative Agent), on demand,
      such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such
      payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately
      available to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the
      greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Swing Line
      Lender in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
      compensation. A certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any
      Revolving Lender (through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any
      amounts owing under this Section 2.04(c)(iii) shall be conclusive absent
      manifest error.

                  (iv) Each Revolving Lender's obligation to make Revolving
      Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations in Swing Line Loans
      pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and
      shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (A) any setoff,
      counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Revolving
      Lender may have against the Swing Line Lender, any Loan Party or any other
      Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) in the case of funding risk
      participations in Swing Line Loans only, the occurrence or continuance of
      a Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not
      similar to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that each Revolving
      Lender's obligation to make Revolving Loans pursuant to this

                                       62
<PAGE>

      Section 2.04(c) is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. No
      such funding of risk participations shall relieve or otherwise impair the
      obligation of the Borrower to repay Swing Line Loans, together with
      interest as provided herein.

            (d)   Repayment of Participations.

                  (i) At any time after any Revolving Lender has purchased and
      funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if the Swing Line Lender
      receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Loan, the Swing Line
      Lender will distribute to such Revolving Lender its Applicable Percentage
      of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments,
      to reflect the period of time during which such Revolving Lender's risk
      participation was funded) in the same funds as those received by the Swing
      Line Lender.

                  (ii) If any payment received by the Swing Line Lender in
      respect of principal or interest on any Swing Line Loan is required to be
      returned by the Swing Line Lender under any of the circumstances described
      in Section 11.05 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
      Swing Line Lender in its discretion), each Revolving Lender shall pay to
      the Swing Line Lender its Applicable Percentage thereof on demand of the
      Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand
      to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per annum equal to the
      Federal Funds Rate. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon
      the request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders under
      this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
      termination of this Agreement.

            (e) Interest for Account of Swing Line Lender. The Swing Line Lender
shall be responsible for invoicing the Loan Party Representative for interest
payable by the Borrower on the Swing Line Loans. Until each Revolving Lender
funds its Base Rate Revolving Loan or risk participation pursuant to this
Section 2.04 to refinance such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of any
Swing Line Loan, interest in respect of such Applicable Percentage shall be
solely for the account of the Swing Line Lender.

            (f) Payments Directly to Swing Line Lender. The Borrower shall make
all payments of principal and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans
directly to the Swing Line Lender.

      SECTION 2.05 PREPAYMENTS.

            (a)   Voluntary Prepayments.

                  (i)   Revolving Loans and Term Loans.

                        (A) The Borrower or the Loan Party Representative may
            upon notice to the Administrative Agent, at any time or from time to
            time, voluntarily prepay Revolving Loans or any Tranche of the Term
            Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty (except as
            provided in Subsection (C) of this Section 2.05(a)(i) and Section
            3.05); provided that (1) such notice must be received by the
            Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (x) three Business
            Days prior to

                                       63
<PAGE>

            any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate
            Loans and (y) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans or RTFC
            Variable Rate Loans, (2) any prepayment of Eurodollar Rate Loans or
            RTFC Fixed Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000
            or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (3) any
            prepayment of Base Rate Loans or RTFC Variable Rate Loans shall be
            in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000
            in excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal
            amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the
            date and amount of such prepayment, whether the Loan to be prepaid
            is a Revolving Loan, a Tranche B Term Loan, a Tranche C Term Loan
            and/or a Tranche D Term Loan and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid
            and each such notice shall be consistent with the other requirements
            of this Section 2.05(a)(i).

                        (B) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each
            applicable Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the
            amount of such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If
            such notice is given by the Loan Party Representative or the
            Borrower, the Borrower shall irrevocably make such prepayment and
            the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable
            on the date specified therein.

                        (C) (1) Any prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan or RTFC
            Fixed Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the
            amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required
            pursuant to Section 3.05.

                            (2) Any voluntary prepayment of Tranche C Term Loans
            and Tranche D Term Loans which are RTFC Variable Rate Loans shall be
            accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together
            with a prepayment fee equal to 0.50% of the principal amount
            prepaid.

                        (D) Prepayments of Term Loans shall be applied to
            outstanding Tranches of the Term Facility (other than the Tranche D
            Term Facility) as the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative may
            elect. Each such prepayment of Loans under a Facility shall be
            applied to the Loans of the Lenders under such Facility in
            accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

                        (E) Prepayments may be applied to the Tranche D Term
            Loans only after (1) the repayment in full of all Tranche B Term
            Loans and Tranche C Term Loans, (2) the repayment in full of all
            Swing Line Loans and all Revolving Loans and (3) the termination of
            the Revolving Commitments.

                        (F) If the Loan Party Representative or the Borrower
            fails to specify the application of a voluntary prepayment then such
            prepayment shall be applied (v) first to Swing Line Loans, (w) then
            to Revolving Loans, (x) then to the Tranche B Term Loans, (y) then
            to the Tranche C Term Loans and (z) finally, if the Revolving
            Commitments have then been terminated, to the Tranche D Term Loans.

                                       64
<PAGE>

                        (G) Unless the Loan Party Representative specifies
            otherwise, repayments under a Facility will be applied first to Base
            Rate Loans or RTFC Variable Rate Loans, as applicable, under such
            Facility and then to Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans,
            as applicable, thereunder.

                  (ii) Swing Line Loans. The Borrower or the Loan Party
      Representative may upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to
      the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time, voluntarily
      prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;
      provided that (A) such notice must be received by the Swing Line Lender
      and the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the
      prepayment, and (B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal
      amount of $100,000. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of
      such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Loan Party Representative
      or the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment
      amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
      specified therein.

            (b)   Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (i) Revolving Commitments. If the Administrative Agent
      notifies the Loan Party Representative or the Borrower at any time that
      the Total Revolving Outstandings at such time exceed an amount equal to
      100% of the Revolving Commitments then in effect, then, within two
      Business Days after receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall immediately
      prepay Revolving Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an
      aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such Total Revolving Outstandings as
      of such date of payment to an amount not to exceed 100% of the Revolving
      Commitments then in effect; provided, however, that subject to the
      provisions of Section 2.03(g), the Borrower shall not be required to Cash
      Collateralize the L/C Obligations pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i)
      unless, after the prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans and Swing Line
      Loans, the Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Revolving Commitments
      then in effect.

                  (ii) Dispositions. Immediately upon receipt by any
      Consolidated Party of aggregate proceeds from Dispositions (other than
      proceeds of any Disposition permitted in Sections 7.05 (b), (c) or (d) or
      the proceeds of any other Dispositions to the extent they constitute
      Reinvestment Funds) in any fiscal year of Holdings in excess of
      $10,000,000, the Borrower shall prepay the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize
      or pay the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of the Net
      Cash Proceeds of all such Dispositions (including the initial $10,000,000
      of such proceeds).

                  (iii) Debt Issuances. Immediately upon receipt by any
      Consolidated Party of proceeds from any Debt Issuance (other than any
      Excluded Debt Issuance Proceeds), the Borrower shall prepay the Loans
      and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal
      to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of such Debt Issuance.

                  (iv) Dividend Suspension Period. If a Dividend Suspension
      Period or Event of Default has commenced and is then continuing, not later
      than 5 Business Days

                                       65
<PAGE>

      after the date on which the Loan Party Representative is required to
      deliver a Compliance Certificate to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
      Section 6.02(b) in respect of each fiscal quarter of Holdings which ends
      during such Dividend Suspension Period (or which ends on a date on which
      an Event of Default has occurred or is continuing), the Borrower shall
      prepay the Loans and/or Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an
      aggregate amount equal to 50% of any increase in Available Cash during
      such fiscal quarter. The requirements of this Section 2.05(b)(iv) shall be
      in addition to, and not in limitation of, Section 8.02.

                  (v) Tranche D Term Loans. The Borrower shall, on each date of
      receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds by any Consolidated Party in respect of
      any amortization payments made by RTFC on any SCCs, prepay an aggregate
      principal amount of the Tranche D Term Loans equal to 100% of the amount
      of such Net Cash Proceeds.

            (c) Application of Mandatory Prepayments. Each mandatory prepayment
made pursuant to Section 2.05(b), except mandatory prepayments made pursuant to
Section 2.05(b)(v), shall be applied as follows:

                  (i) with respect to all amounts paid pursuant to Section
      2.05(b)(i), first to Revolving Loans, second to Swing Line Loans, and

                  (ii) with respect to all amounts paid pursuant to Section
      2.05(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv), so long as no Event of Default has occurred
      and is continuing (A) first, subject to Section 2.05(d), pro rata to the
      Tranche B Term Loans and any Tranche C Term Loans which are RTFC Variable
      Rate Loans, (B) second, to (1) the Revolving Loans (with a corresponding
      reduction in the Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 2.06(b)), (2)
      then to Swing Line Loans (with a corresponding reduction in the Revolving
      Commitments pursuant to Section 2.06(b)) and (3) then to Cash
      Collateralize L/C Obligations, (C) third, to any Tranche C Term Loans
      which are RTFC Fixed Rate Loans, and (D) fourth, after the termination of
      all Revolving Commitments and the repayment in full of all amounts payable
      with respect to the Revolving Loans, the Tranche B Term Loans and the
      Tranche C Term Loans, to the Tranche D Term Loans; and

                  (iii) with respect to all amounts paid pursuant to Section
      2.05(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv) after an Event of Default has occurred and is
      continuing, (A) first, subject to Section 2.05(d), pro rata to the Tranche
      B Term Loans, the Tranche C Term Loans and the Revolving Loans (with no
      corresponding reduction in the Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section
      2.06 and assuming for purposes of such pro rata allocation that the
      Revolving Facility is fully drawn); provided, however, that at such time
      as all Revolving Loans have been prepaid (including the repayment of all
      Swing Line Loans and the Cash Collateralization of all L/C Obligations),
      such prepayments shall be applied, subject to Section 2.05(d), pro rata to
      the Tranche B Term Loans and the Tranche C Term Loans and (B) second,
      after the repayment in full of all amounts payable with respect to the
      Revolving Loans (including the repayment of all Swing Line Loans and the
      Cash

                                       66
<PAGE>

      Collateralization of all L/C Obligations), the Tranche B Term Loans and
      the Tranche C Term Loans, to the Tranche D Term Loans.

            (d) Tranche C Deferrals. Notwithstanding Section 2.05(c), any
Tranche C Term Lender may elect, by notice to the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed promptly in writing by telecopy), not later than 2:00 p.m.
on the Business Day prior to any mandatory prepayment of its Tranche C Term
Loans, so long as any Tranche B Term Loans remain outstanding, to decline all or
any portion of any prepayment of its Tranche C Term Loans, in which case such
prepayment that would have been applied to prepay its Tranche C Term Loans but
was so declined shall be applied to prepay Tranche B Term Loans as provided
above (without giving effect to the Tranche C Term Loans of any Tranche C Term
Lender that has declined payment pursuant to this Section).

            (e) Funding Losses. Each mandatory prepayment of any Loans made
pursuant to this Section shall be subject to Section 3.05.

            (f) Notice. The Loan Party Representative shall give to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders at least three Business Days' prior notice
of each and every event or occurrence requiring a prepayment under Section
2.05(b)(ii) and (iii), including the amount of Net Cash Proceeds expected to be
received therefrom and the expected schedule for receiving such proceeds.

      SECTION 2.06 TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF COMMITMENTS.

            (a) The Borrower, or the Loan Party Representative on behalf of the
Borrower, may upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Revolving

provided that (i) any such notice shall be received by the Administrative Agent
not later than 11:00 a.m. three Business Days prior to the date of termination

terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect thereto
and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Revolving Outstandings
would exceed the Revolving Commitments, and (iv) if, after giving effect to any
reduction of the Revolving Commitments, the Letter of Credit Sublimit or the
Swing Line Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Revolving Commitments, such
Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of any such excess. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Revolving Lenders of any such
notice of termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments. Any reduction
of the Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of each
Revolving Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All commitment fees
accrued until the effective date of any termination of the Revolving Commitments
shall be paid on the effective date of such termination.

            (b) On any date that any Revolving Loans are required to be prepaid,
Swing Line Loans are required to be prepaid, and/or the L/C Obligations are
required to be paid or Cash Collateralized as a result of a prepayment required
by Section 2.05(b) (or would be so required if any Revolving Loans, Swing Line
Loans or L/C Obligations were outstanding), the Revolving Commitments shall,
except as otherwise provided in Section 2.05(c)(iii), be automatically and

                                       67
<PAGE>

permanently reduced by the total amount of such required prepayments and Cash
Collateral; provided that, regardless of whether any Revolving Loans, Swing Line
Loans or L/C Obligations are outstanding, the Revolving Commitments shall be
automatically and permanently reduced in the amounts and under the conditions
and times specified in Section 2.05(c)(ii). The Administrative Agent will
promptly notify the Revolving Lenders of any such reduction of the Revolving
Commitments. Any reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be applied to the
Revolving Commitment of each Revolving Lender according to its Applicable
Percentage. The Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

            (c) The Commitments to make Tranche B Term Loans shall be
automatically and permanently reduced to $0 on the Closing Date after giving
effect to the Tranche B Term Borrowings on the Closing Date.

            (d) The Commitments to make Tranche C Term Loans shall be
automatically and permanently reduced to $0 on the Closing Date after giving
effect to the Tranche C Term Borrowings on the Closing Date.

            (e) The Commitments to make Tranche D Term Loans shall be
automatically and permanently reduced to $0 on the Closing Date after giving
effect to the Tranche D Term Borrowings on the Closing Date.

      SECTION 2.07 REPAYMENT OF LOANS. (a) The Borrower shall repay to the
Revolving Lenders on the Maturity Date the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans

Maturity Date, the Outstanding Amount of Tranche B Term Loans on such date.

            (d) The Borrower shall repay to the Tranche C Term Lenders on the
Maturity Date the Outstanding Amount of Tranche C Term Loans on such date.

            (e) The Borrower shall repay to the Tranche D Term Lenders on the
Maturity Date the Outstanding Amount of Tranche D Term Loans on such date.

      SECTION 2.08 INTEREST.

            (a) Revolving Loans and Tranche B Term Loans may be outstanding as
Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans. Tranche C Term Loans and Tranche D
Term Loans may be outstanding as RTFC Variable Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate
Loans. Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurodollar
Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for
each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate; (iii) each RTFC Variable Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum
equal to the RTFC Variable Rate, (iv) each RTFC Fixed Rate

                                       68
<PAGE>

Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each
Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the RTFC Fixed Rate for such
Interest Period and (v) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

            (b)   (i) If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when
due (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount thereafter shall bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.

                  (i) If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable
      by any Loan Party under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after
      giving effect to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated
      maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then upon the request of the
      Required Lenders, such amount shall thereafter bear interest at the
      Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

                  (ii) Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event
      of Default exists, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount
      of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate
      per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent
      permitted by applicable Laws.

                  (iii) Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts
      (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon
      demand.

            (c) Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment and before and after the commencement
of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

      SECTION 2.09 FEES. In addition to certain fees described in subsections
(i) and (j) of Section 2.03:

            (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage, a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to 0.50% times the
actual daily amount by which the Revolving Commitments exceed the sum of (i) the
Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (ii) the Outstanding Amount of L/C
Obligations; provided that for the purposes of calculating the Commitment Fee,
Swing Line Loans will not be deemed to be utilized. The Commitment Fee shall
accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at any time during
which one or more of the conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due
and payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing with the first such date to occur after the
Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The Commitment Fee shall be calculated
quarterly in arrears. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no
Commitment Fee shall accrue on any of the Revolving Commitments of a Defaulting
Lender so long as such Revolving Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender.

                                       69
<PAGE>

            (b) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agents and the
Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and
at the times specified in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter. The Borrower
shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in
writing in the amounts and at the times so specified.

      SECTION 2.10 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES. All computations of
interest for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by Bank of
America's "prime rate" and for RTFC Variable Rate Loans shall be made on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed.
All other computations of fees and interest shall be made on the basis of a
360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as
applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year).
Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and
shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the
Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same
day on which it is made shall, subject to Section 2.12(a), bear interest for one
day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee
hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

      SECTION 2.11 EVIDENCE OF DEBT.

            (a) The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive
absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders
to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record
or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to
the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records
maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall
evidence such Lender's Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each
Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type,
amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

            (b) In addition to the accounts and records referred to in
subsection (a) above, each Revolving Lender and the Administrative Agent shall
maintain in accordance with their usual practice accounts or records evidencing
the purchases and sales of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained
by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Revolving Lender
in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent
shall control in the absence of manifest error.

            (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the
Register pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above, and by each Lender in its
accounts pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above, shall be prima facie
evidence of the amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become
due and payable from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register each Lender
and, in the case of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this

                                       70
<PAGE>

Agreement and the other Loan Documents, absent manifest error; provided that the
failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to make any entry, or any
finding that an entry is incorrect, in the Register or such account or accounts
shall not limit or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

      SECTION 2.12 PAYMENTS GENERALLY.

            (a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made
without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or
setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the
Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Administrative
Agent's Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 2:00
p.m. on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly
distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share
as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer
to such Lender's Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent after 2:00 p.m. shall, solely for the purpose of the calculation of
interest and fees, be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and
any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

            (b) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless
the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurodollar Rate Loans (or in the case of any
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing)
that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section
2.02 (or in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has
made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by Section
2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower
a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its
share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then
the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of
a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by
the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower
and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same
or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If
such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative
Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in
such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any
claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
payment to the Administrative Agent.

            (c) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower or
the Loan Party Representative prior to the date on which any payment is due to
the Administrative Agent for the

                                       71
<PAGE>

account of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has
made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon
such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be,
severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, in immediately available
funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation.

      A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Loan Party
Representative with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (c) shall
be conclusive, absent manifest error.

            (d) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes
available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such
Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such
funds are not made available to the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative by
the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit
Extension set forth in Article IV are not satisfied or waived in accordance with
the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall promptly return such funds (in
like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest;
provided, however, that if such funds are not returned within one Business Day,
such funds shall bear interest at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.

            (e) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders
hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing
Line Loans and the obligations of the Lenders to make payments pursuant to
Section 11.04(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make
any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section
11.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of
its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase
its participation or to make its payment under Section 11.04(c).

            (f) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any
Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to
constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

      SECTION 2.13 SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS. If any Lender shall, by
exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise (except as
specifically provided in the last paragraph of Section 8.03), obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it under any
Facility, or in the case of any Revolving Lender, the participations in L/C
Obligations or in Swing Line Loans held by it, resulting in such Lender's
receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or
participations and accrued interest thereon

                                       72
<PAGE>

greater than its Applicable Percentage thereof as provided herein, then the
Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative
Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in
the Loans under such Facility and in the case of any Revolving Lender,
subparticipations in L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Revolving
Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders under such Facility
ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
interest on their respective Loans under such Facility and other amounts owing
them; provided that:

                  (i) if any such participations or subparticipations are
      purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
      recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and
      the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
      interest; and

                  (ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to
      apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
      accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment
      obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
      participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C Obligations
      or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the
      Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this
      Section shall apply).

      Each Loan Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such
Loan Party rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Loan Party in the
amount of such participation.

      SECTION 2.14 EXISTING SENIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT. (a) Effective on the
Closing Date, (i) the Existing Senior Credit Agreement shall be amended and (for
the mutual convenience of the parties and not as a novation) restated in its
entirety as provided in this Agreement, (ii) any outstanding Loans (as defined
under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) after giving effect to any
prepayments thereof on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be outstanding Loans
under this Agreement as provided in Section 2.14(b), (iii) any outstanding
Letters of Credit (as defined under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) shall
be deemed to be outstanding Letters of Credit for the account of the Borrower
under this Agreement, (iv) all outstanding obligations under the Existing Senior
Credit Agreement, as so amended and restated under this Agreement, shall
continue to be secured pursuant to each of the Collateral Documents (as defined
in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement), (v) each such existing Collateral
Document shall be amended and (for the mutual convenience of the parties and not
as a novation) restated in its entirety or amended and supplemented pursuant to
the applicable Collateral Documents hereunder, and all Liens granted pursuant to
the existing Collateral Documents under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect under the Collateral Documents
hereunder, and (vi) all Secured Swap Contracts secured pursuant to such existing
Collateral Documents shall continue to be Secured Swap Contracts for all
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents hereunder.

                                       73
<PAGE>

            (b) Effective on the Closing Date, the Obligations (as defined under
the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) which remain outstanding after giving
effect to any prepayments thereof on such date will be restated and continued
under this Agreement as follows: (i) any such outstanding Tranche B Term Loans
(as such term is defined in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) of any lender
under the Existing Senior Credit Agreement which has requested such treatment
for such Loans by written notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant to a
Conversion Notice will be restated as Tranche B Term Loans of such Lender as
provided in Section 2.01(a)(iii); (ii) any such outstanding Tranche C Term Loans
(as such term is defined in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement) held by a
Tranche C Term Lender hereunder, will be continued as Tranche C Term Loans of
such Lender in a like amount hereunder; and (c) any such outstanding Tranche D
Term Loans (as such term is defined in the Existing Senior Credit Agreement)
held by a Tranche D Term Lender hereunder will be continued as Tranche D Term
Loans of such Lender in a like amount hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE III
                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

      SECTION 3.01 TAXES.

            (a) Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of
any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, provided that if any Loan Party shall be
required by any Laws to deduct any Indemnified Taxes (including any Other Taxes)
from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so
that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or
L/C Issuer, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Loan Party shall make
such deductions and (iii) such Loan Party shall timely pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law; provided, further that in respect of any such deduction from a payment in
respect of an Obligation by any Loan Party to any Lender, with the prior written
consent of such Lender (in the sole discretion of such Lender), such Loan Party
may pay the full amount so deducted as specifically agreed with such Lender (in
lieu of paying the relevant Governmental Authority as provided in clause (iii)
above) pending the resolution of any contest of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes in respect of such payment as provided in any such written agreement
between such Loan Party and such Lender; and provided, further, that no such
agreement with any Lender shall release or otherwise modify the obligations of
the Loan Parties hereunder to any other Lender, the Administrative Agent or the
L/C Issuer.

            (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties. Without limiting the
provisions of subsection (a) above, the Loan Parties shall timely pay any Other
Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law.

            (c) Indemnification by the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the L/C Issuer, within 10
days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted
on or attributable to amounts payable under this

                                       74
<PAGE>

Section) paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the
case may be, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or
liability (which shall include a statement setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis and calculation of any such payment or liability) delivered to the
Loan Party Representative by a Lender or the L/C Issuer (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender or the L/C Issuer, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            (d) Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment
of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Loan Party to a Governmental
Authority, such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment (to the extent such a receipt is issued therefor), a
copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

            (e) Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an
exemption from withholding tax under the Law of the jurisdiction in which the
Loan Parties are residents for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such
jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall deliver to the Loan Party Representative (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or
reasonably requested by the Loan Party Representative or the Administrative
Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable Law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding. In
addition, any Lender, if requested by the Loan Party Representative or the
Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by
applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Loan Party Representative or the
Administrative Agent as will enable the Loan Party Representative or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements.

      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any Foreign Lender and
any Lender which is a Non-Corporate Domestic Lender shall deliver to the Loan
Party Representative and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as
shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter
upon the request of the Loan Party Representative or the Administrative Agent,
but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the
following is applicable:

                  (i) in the case of a Foreign Lender,

                        (A) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service
            Form W-8BEN or W-8IMY, as appropriate (or any successor form),
            claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which
            the United States is a party and certifying that such Lender is
            entitled thereunder to a zero (0) rate of United States withholding
            tax in payments made pursuant to the Loan Documents,

                                       75
<PAGE>

                        (B) duly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service
            Form W-8ECI (or any successor form),

                        (C) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the
            benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section
            881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such
            Foreign Lender is not (I) a "bank" within the meaning of Section
            881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (II) a "ten percent shareholder" within
            the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code of the Borrower, or
            (III) a "controlled foreign corporation" described in Section
            881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly completed copies of Internal
            Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, or Form W-81MY, as applicable (or any
            successor form), certifying that such Lender is exempt from United
            States withholding tax on payments made pursuant to the Loan
            Documents, or

                        (D) any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a
            basis for claiming exemption from United States Federal withholding
            tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as
            may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Loan Party
            Representative to determine the withholding or deduction required to
            be made; and

                  (ii) in the case of a Non-Corporate Domestic Lender, a duly
      completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form).

      Each Lender which has delivered any of the forms described above as
provided in this Section 3.01(e) shall deliver to the Loan Party Representative
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) to the extent it is legally entitled
to do so such new forms prescribed by the IRS upon expiration or obsolescence of
any such previously delivered forms or after the occurrence of an event
requiring a change in the most recent such forms delivered by such Lender
hereunder, in each case, not later than 30 days following the earlier of the
date such Lender first becomes aware of the need to deliver such new form and
the date of any request for such new form from the Loan Party Representative.
Each such Lender shall also provide written notice to the Loan Party
Representative (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) not later than 30 days
after the date on which it determines that it is no longer in a position to
deliver any such previously delivered form.

            (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or the L/C Issuer determines, in its sole reasonable discretion, that it
has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Loan Parties or with respect to which the Loan Parties have
paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section (whether by way of direct
payment or by offset), within 45 days of such determination it shall pay to the
Loan Party Representative an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent
of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties
under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative
Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, and without interest
(other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with
respect to such refund); provided that the Loan Parties, upon the request of the
Administrative Agent, such Lender or the L/C Issuer to the Loan Party
Representative, agrees to repay the amount paid over

                                       76
<PAGE>

to the Loan Party Representative (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent,
such Lender or the L/C Issuer in the event the Administrative Agent, such Lender
or the L/C Issuer is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Loan
Party Representative, any Loan Party or any other Person.

      SECTION 3.02 ILLEGALITY. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law
has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or
fund Eurodollar Rate Loans, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material
restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take
deposits of Dollars in the London interbank market, or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon the Eurodollar Rate, then, on notice thereof by such
Lender to the Loan Party Representative through the Administrative Agent, any
obligation of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until such
Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party Representative that
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon
receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all
Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day
of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender
may not lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted. At such time as any such Lender determines that
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist, it shall so
notify the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party Representative.

      SECTION 3.03 INABILITY TO DETERMINE RATES. If the Required Lenders
determine that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurodollar
Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof that (a) Dollar deposits
are not being offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the
applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurodollar Rate Loan, (b) adequate
and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any
requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan or (c)
that the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a
proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so
notify the Loan Party Representative and each Lender. Thereafter, the obligation
of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended
until the Administrative Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders)
revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Loan Party Representative
may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation
of Eurodollar Rate Loans, and if it does not revoke such request, it will be
deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans in the amount specified therein. At the request of the Loan Party
Representative, the Administrative Agent shall ask the Required Lenders whether
the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist and they are
able to give any such revocation instruction.

      SECTION 3.04 INCREASED COSTS.

            (a) Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

                  (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
      deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against
      assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or
      participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected
      in the Eurodollar Rate) or the L/C Issuer;

                  (ii) subject any Lender or the L/C Issuer to any Tax with
      respect to this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, any participation in a
      Letter of Credit or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the
      basis of taxation of payments to such Lender or the L/C Issuer in respect
      thereof (except for Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section
      3.01 and the imposition of, or any change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax
      payable by such Lender or the L/C Issuer); or

                  (iii) impose on any Lender or the L/C Issuer or the London
      interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this
      Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of
      Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan), or to increase the cost to such Lender or the
L/C Issuer of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or
of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of
Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such
Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other
amount), then, upon request of such Lender or the L/C Issuer, the Borrower will
pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be,
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

            (b) Capital Requirements. If any Lender or the L/C Issuer determines
that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or the L/C Issuer or any Lending
Office of such Lender or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if
any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's capital or on the capital of
such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company, if any, as a consequence of
this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or
participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of
Credit issued by the L/C Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or the
L/C Issuer or such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or
the L/C Issuer's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's
holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the
Borrower will pay to such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or
such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's holding company for any such reduction
suffered.

            (c) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender or the
L/C Issuer setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the amount or
amounts necessary to

                                       78
<PAGE>

compensate such Lender or the L/C Issuer or its holding company, as the case may
be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the
Loan Party Representative shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay such Lender or the L/C Issuer, as the case may be, the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

            (d) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or
the L/C Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the L/C Issuer's
right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be
required to compensate a Lender or the L/C Issuer pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions
suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Lender or the L/C
Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Loan Party Representative of the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or
the L/C Issuer's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the
Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the six-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof).

      SECTION 3.05 FUNDING LOSSES. (a) Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly
compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or
expense incurred by it as a result of:

                  (i) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any
      Loan (other than a Base Rate Loan or a RTFC Variable Rate Loan) on a day
      other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether
      voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

                  (ii) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the
      failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or
      convert any Loan (other than a Base Rate Loan or a RTFC Variable Rate
      Loan) on the date or in the amount notified by the Loan Party
      Representative; or

                  (iii) any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other
      than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request
      by the Borrower pursuant to Section 11.13.

            (b) In the case of any such Eurodollar Rate Loan, any such loss,
cost or expense will include any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or
expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to
maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which
such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary
administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing. For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05 in respect of Eurodollar Rate Loans, each Lender shall be
deemed to have funded each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it at the Eurodollar
Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the London
interbank eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period,
whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

                                       79
<PAGE>

            (c) In the case of any such RTFC Fixed Rate Loan voluntarily prepaid
pursuant to Section 2.05(a) or mandatorily prepaid pursuant to Section
2.05(b)(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), such loss, cost and expense shall be deemed to
be equal to the applicable RTFC Make Whole Premium.

      SECTION 3.06 MITIGATION OBLIGATIONS; REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS.

            (a) Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender
requests compensation under Section 3.04, or a Loan Party is required to pay any
additional amount or indemnification to any Lender or any Governmental Authority
for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives a
notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts
to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans
hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its
offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant
to Section 3.01 or 3.04, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the
need for the notice pursuant to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each
case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby
agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

            (b) Replacement of Lenders. If any Revolving Lender or Tranche B
Term Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, or submits a notice
pursuant to Section 3.02 with respect to circumstances that do not affect the
other Lenders hereunder, or if a Loan Party is required to pay any additional
amount or indemnification to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the
account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, the Borrower may replace such
Lender in accordance with Section 11.13.

      SECTION 3.07 MATTERS APPLICABLE TO ALL REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION. A
certificate of the Administrative Agent or any Lender claiming compensation
under this Article III and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of
the additional amount or amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive
in the absence of manifest error. In determining such amount, the Administrative
Agent or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

      SECTION 3.08 SURVIVAL. All of the Loan Parties' obligations under this
Article III shall survive termination of the Commitments and repayment of all
other Obligations hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                    CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CREDIT EXTENSIONS

when aggregated with the proceeds of the Term Loans (and the proceeds of any
Revolving Loans as may be borrowed hereunder on the Closing Date) and the
proceeds of the Permitted Additional Debt to be issued as a part of the
Transaction, shall be sufficient to, and shall be used to, consummate the
transactions contemplated in the Transaction Documents to be consummated on the
Closing Date, including to pay any Restricted Payments contemplated to be paid
as a part of the Transaction and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the
Transaction in amounts approved by the Arrangers.

            (h) The Administrative Agent shall have received certification as to
the financial condition and solvency of each Loan Party after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents by the chief
financial officer of Holdings.

            (i) The credit facilities evidenced by this Agreement shall have

disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent to the extent invoiced
prior to or on the Closing Date, plus such additional reasonable amounts of
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent as shall
constitute its reasonable estimate of fees, charges and disbursements of counsel
to the Administrative Agent incurred or to be incurred by it through the closing
proceedings (provided, that such estimate shall not thereafter preclude a final

                                       84
<PAGE>

settling of accounts among the Borrower and the Administrative Agent) or such
amounts shall be paid from the proceeds of the initial Loans on the Closing
Date.

      Without limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 10.04, for
purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified in this Section
4.01, each Lender that has signed this Agreement shall be deemed to have
consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each document or
other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable
or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Closing Date specifying its
objection thereto.

      SECTION 4.02 CONDITIONS TO ALL CREDIT EXTENSIONS. The obligation of each
Lender to honor any Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice
requesting only a conversion of Loans to the other Type, or a continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans) is subject to the following
conditions precedent:

            (a) The representations and warranties of the Loan Parties contained
in Article V or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document
furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, shall be
true and correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such Credit
Extension, (i) except to the extent that such representations and warranties
specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date, and (ii) except that
for purposes of this Section 4.02, the representations and warranties contained
in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most
recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and (b), respectively,
of Section 6.01.

            (b) No Default shall exist, or would result from such proposed
Credit Extension or from the application of the proceeds thereof.

            (c) The Administrative Agent and, if applicable, the L/C Issuer or
the Swing Line Lender, shall have received a Request for Credit Extension, in
each case in accordance with the requirements hereto.

      Each Request for Credit Extension (other than a Loan Notice requesting
only a conversion of Loans to the other Type or a continuation of Eurodollar
Rate Loans or RTFC Fixed Rate Loans) submitted by the Loan Party Representative
shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty that the conditions
specified in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) have been satisfied on and as of the date
of the applicable Credit Extension.

                                    ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

      Each Loan Party represents and warrants to the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders that:

      SECTION 5.01 EXISTENCE, QUALIFICATION AND POWER. Each of the Consolidated
Parties (a) is duly organized or formed, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, (b) has
all requisite corporate or other organizational power and authority and all
requisite Governmental Authorizations to (i) own or

                                       85
<PAGE>

lease its assets and carry on its business as presently conducted and (ii)
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Loan Documents to which
it is a party, and (c) is duly qualified and in good standing under the Laws of
each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of properties or the
conduct of its business requires such qualification and where the failure to be
so qualified could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 5.02 AUTHORIZATION; NO CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Loan Party of each Loan Document to which such Person is
party have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or other
organizational action. The execution, delivery and performance by each Loan
Party of each Loan Document to which it is a party, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby with respect to each Loan Party, do not and

Laws and by general equitable principles (whether enforcement is sought by
proceedings in equity or at law).

      SECTION 5.05 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; NO MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.

            (a) The Audited Financial Statements furnished to each of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise
expressly noted therein, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition of VTC and its Subsidiaries, Southwest and its Subsidiaries
and Southwest II and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the date thereof,
and their results of operations for the period covered thereby in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as
otherwise expressly noted therein, and (iii) show all material indebtedness and
other material liabilities, direct or contingent, of VTC and its Subsidiaries,
Southwest and its Subsidiaries and Southwest II and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, as of the date thereof, including liabilities for taxes, material
commitments and Indebtedness to the extent required in accordance with GAAP.

            (b) The Unaudited Financial Statements furnished to the
Administrative Agent and each Lender (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the period covered thereby, except as otherwise
expressly noted therein, and (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, when read together with the notes therein, of VTC and its

Closing Date for which financial information is available, were prepared on a
Pro Forma Basis giving effect to the consummation of the Transaction, for the
trailing four quarters of operations ending on such most recently ended fiscal
quarter of Holdings and its Subsidiaries, and have been furnished to each
Lender. Such pro-forma balance sheets and income statements have been prepared
in good faith by Holdings based on the assumptions believed by Holdings on the
date hereof and on the Closing Date to be reasonably based on the best
information available to Holdings as of the date of delivery thereof, accurately
reflect all material adjustments required to be made to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, and present fairly in
all material respects on a Pro Forma Basis the estimated consolidated financial
position of Holdings and its Subsidiaries as of the most recent fiscal quarter

reason to believe that such pro-forma balance sheets or income statements are
misleading in any material respect in light of the circumstances existing at the
time of the preparation thereof.

the payment of money exceeding the Threshold Amount and not covered by insurance

investments in any other corporation or entity with an aggregate original cost

defined in the Pledge and Security Agreement) subject to an Account Control
Agreement). The outstanding shares of Equity Interests shown have been validly
issued, fully-paid and are non-assessable (other than with respect to any
partnership or limited liability company) and owned free and clear of Liens
other

                                       88

Permitted Liens. Each Consolidated Party has obtained all Governmental
Authorizations and all private permits, licenses, franchises or other
certifications, consents, approvals and authorizations, governmental or private,

marks, trade names, copyrights, patents, patent rights, franchises, licenses and

Asset and (ii) no Loan Party leases any Real Property Asset at which personal
property (including fixtures) of the Loan Parties with an aggregate fair market
value in excess of $1,000,000 is located, and Schedule 5.12 as so supplemented

similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where any of the

or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

transactions contemplated hereby and the negotiation of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents or delivered hereunder or thereunder or under any other
Loan Document (in each case, as modified or supplemented by other information so
furnished) taken as a whole contains any material misstatement of fact or omits
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided
that with respect to projected financial information, each Consolidated Party
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time such projections were
prepared.

      SECTION 5.22 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Consolidated Party is in
compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all Laws and all
orders, writs, injunctions and decrees applicable to it or to its properties,
except in such instances in which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ,
injunction or decree is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted or (b) the failure to comply therewith, either individually

Credit Extension made on the Closing Date, (a) the fair value of the assets of
each of the Loan Parties will exceed its debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise, (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of
each of the Loan Parties will be greater than the amount that will be required

identify that portion of the Loan Party Materials that may be made available to
Public Lenders and that all such Loan Party Materials shall be clearly and
conspicuously marked "PUBLIC" by the Loan Parties which, at a minimum, shall
mean that the word "PUBLIC" shall appear prominently on the first page thereof;
(x) by marking Loan Party Materials "PUBLIC," the Loan Parties shall be deemed
to have authorized the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers , the L/C Issuer and
the Lenders to treat such Loan Party Materials as not containing any material
non-public information with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities for
purposes of United States Federal and state securities laws (provided, however,

as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not designated
"Public Investor." The Loan Parties shall be under no obligation to designate
any Loan Party Materials as "PUBLIC."

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that no Loan
Party shall be required to preserve any Governmental Authorization or any
material right, privilege, permit, license, approval or franchise if the general
partner, board of managers, board of directors (or group performing a similar
function) of such Loan Party shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
longer desirable in the conduct of the business of such Loan Party and that the
loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to such Loan Party
or the Lenders; provided, further, that no such determination shall excuse any
breach of the Loan Parties' obligations under any other provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document if preservation of any such Governmental
Authorization, right, privilege, permit, license approval or franchise is
necessary to the compliance by the Loan Parties with the requirements thereof;
and provided further that any Loan Party shall be permitted to change its name

similar businesses and owning similar properties in localities where such
Consolidated Party operates, of such types and in such amounts, with such
deductibles and covering such risks, as are customarily carried under similar
circumstances by such other Persons (or otherwise required in the Collateral
Documents). The Administrative Agent shall be named as loss payee and/or
additional insured with respect to any such insurance providing coverage in
respect of any Collateral, and each provider of any such insurance shall agree,
by endorsement upon the policy or policies issued by it or by independent
instruments furnished to the Administrative Agent, that it will give the
Administrative Agent 30 days prior written notice before any such policy or
policies shall be altered or canceled, and that no act or default of any
Consolidated Party or any other Person shall affect the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders under such policy or policies.

            (b) In case of any Casualty or Condemnation with respect to any
Property of any Consolidated Party or any part thereof with a book value in
excess of the Threshold Amount, promptly give written notice thereof to the
Administrative Agent generally describing the nature and extent of such damage,
destruction or taking. In such event, the Borrower shall, or shall cause such
Consolidated Party to, promptly repair, restore or replace the Property of such
Consolidated Party (or such part thereof), which was subject to such Casualty or
Condemnation, at such Consolidated Party's cost and expense, whether or not the
Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Award, if any, received on account of such
event shall be sufficient for that purpose; provided, however, that such
Property need not be repaired, restored or replaced to the extent the failure to
make such repair, restoration or replacement (i)(A) is desirable to the proper

                                      103
<PAGE>

conduct of the business of such Consolidated Party in the ordinary course and
otherwise in the best interest of such Consolidated Party and (B) would not
materially impair the rights and benefits of the Administrative Agent or the
Secured Parties under the Collateral Documents or any other Loan Document or
(ii) is attributable to the application of the Insurance Proceeds from such
Casualty or the Condemnation Award from such Condemnation to payment of the
Obligations in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.05.

            (c) In the event any Consolidated Party receives any Insurance
Proceeds, Condemnation Award or Net Cash Proceeds from any Disposition (other
than any Disposition permitted pursuant to Sections 7.05(b), (c) or (d)), the
Borrower will promptly (1) pay over, or cause such funds to be paid over, such
proceeds to the Administrative Agent, for prepayment of the Obligations in
accordance with Section 2.05(b) or, (2) if such funds constitute Reinvestment
Funds, pending such reinvestment either (x) deposit or cause such funds to be
deposited in an account subject to an Account Control Agreement or (y) prepay
any then outstanding Revolving Loans (with no corresponding Revolving Commitment
reduction). The Administrative Agent agrees to release such Insurance Proceeds,
Condemnation Awards or other Net Cash Proceeds held by the Administrative Agent
to the Borrower upon request by the Loan Party Representative as needed from
time to time to pay for the repair, restoration or replacement of the Property
subject to such Casualty or Condemnation or other Disposition or to purchase
such other Capital Assets if, but only if, the conditions set forth in the
definition of "Reinvestment Funds" are satisfied at the time of such request.

            (d) In connection with the covenants set forth in this Section 6.07,
it is understood and agreed that:

                  (i) none of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or their
      respective agents or employees shall be liable for any loss or damage
      insured by the insurance policies required to be maintained under this
      Section 6.07, it being understood that (A) the Consolidated Parties shall
      look solely to their insurance companies or any other parties other than
      the aforesaid parties for the recovery of such loss or damage and (B) such
      insurance companies shall have no rights of subrogation against the
      Administrative Agent, the Lenders or their agents or employees. If,
      however, the insurance policies do not provide waiver of subrogation
      rights against such parties, as required above, then each of the Loan
      Parties shall, and shall cause each Consolidated Party to, waive its right
      of recovery, if any, against the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
      their agents and employees, to the extent permitted by Law;

                  (ii) the Consolidated Parties will permit a third party
      insurance consultant retained by the Administrative Agent, at the expense
      of the Borrower, to review the insurance policies maintained by the
      Consolidated Parties upon the occurrence of an Event of Default; and

                  (iii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
      Event of Default the Required Lenders shall have the right from time to
      time to require the Consolidated Parties to keep other insurance in such
      form and amount as the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may
      reasonably request; provided that such insurance shall be obtainable on
      commercially reasonable terms; and provided

                                      104
<PAGE>

      further that the designation of any form, type or amount of insurance
      coverage by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders under this
      Section 6.07 shall in no event be deemed a representation, warranty or
      advice by the Administrative Agent or the Lenders that such insurance is
      adequate for the purposes of the business of the Consolidated Parties or
      the protection of their properties.

      SECTION 6.08 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. Comply in all
material respects with the requirements of all Laws and all orders, writs,
injunctions and decrees applicable to it or to its business or property and all
Contractual Obligations to which it is a party, except in such instances in
which (a) such requirement of Law or order, writ, injunction or decree or
Contractual Obligation is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings diligently conducted or (b) the failure to comply therewith could
not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

      SECTION 6.09 BOOKS AND RECORDS. (a) Maintain proper books of record and
account, in which full, true and correct entries in conformity with GAAP
consistently applied shall be made of all financial transactions and matters
involving the assets and business of the Consolidated Parties, as the case may
be; and (b) maintain such books of record and account in material conformity
with all applicable requirements of any Governmental Authority having regulatory
jurisdiction over the Consolidated Parties.

      SECTION 6.10 INSPECTION RIGHTS. Permit representatives and independent
contractors of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders to visit and inspect any
of its properties, to examine its corporate, financial and operating records,
and make copies thereof or abstracts therefrom, and to discuss its affairs,
finances and accounts with its directors, officers, and independent public
accountants, at such reasonable times during normal business hours and as often
as may be reasonably desired, upon reasonable advance notice to the Loan Party
Representative; provided, however, that when an Event of Default exists the
Administrative Agent or any Lender (or any of their respective representatives
or independent contractors) may do any of the foregoing at the expense of the
Borrower at any time during normal business hours and without advance notice.

      SECTION 6.11 FURTHER ASSURANCES WITH RESPECT TO ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARIES.
(a) Cause the Loan Party Representative to notify the Administrative Agent at
the time that any Consolidated Party shall organize or Acquire a new Subsidiary

Administrative Agent as to the validity, perfection and priority of the Liens
created or intended to be created by the Loan Documents.

(which may be with swap counterparties other than a Swap Bank), the effect of
which shall be that the rate of interest that would be payable in connection
with fifty percent (50%) of all Consolidated Funded Indebtedness (except the
Revolving Loans and Consolidated Funded Indebtedness under clause (c) of the
definition of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness) of the Consolidated Parties,
shall either be fixed or limited under a Swap Contract or other interest rate
protection arrangement having a term ending on or after the second anniversary

groundwater sampling) by a consultant reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent as to the nature and extent of the presence of Hazardous
Materials on any Subject Properties and as to the compliance by the Consolidated
Parties with Environmental Laws at such Subject Properties. If the Loan Party
Representative on behalf of the Loan Parties fails to deliver such an
environmental report within 75 days after receipt of such written request then
the Administrative Agent may arrange for the same, and each of the Consolidated
Parties hereby agrees that the Administrative Agent and its representatives may
have access to the Subject Properties to reasonably undertake such an assessment
(including, where appropriate, invasive soil or groundwater sampling). The
reasonable cost of any assessment arranged for by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this provision will be payable by the Borrower on demand and added
to the Obligations secured by the Collateral Documents.

            (b) Conduct and complete all investigations, studies, sampling, and
testing and all remedial, removal, and other actions necessary to address all
Hazardous Materials on, from or affecting any of the Subject Properties to the
extent necessary to be in compliance with all Environmental Laws and with the
validly issued orders and directives of all Governmental Authorities with

Mortgage, (ii) evidence satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that

                                       123

items or portion of the Collateral, such Lien is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be null and void, invalid or unenforceable in any
respect or ceases to have the priority purported to be granted under such
Collateral Document (except pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under

<PAGE>

aggregate principal amount in excess of the Threshold Amount, at any time after

      SECTION 8.02 REMEDIES UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. If any Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Administrative Agent shall, at the request of, or
may, with the consent of, the Required Lenders (or, in the case of actions
described under clauses (a) and (b) below, the Required Revolving Lenders), take
any or all of the following actions:

            (a) declare the Commitments of each Lender to make Loans and any
obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions to be terminated,
whereupon such Commitments and obligation shall be terminated;

            (b) require that the Borrower Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations
(in an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount thereof);

            (c) declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans,
all interest accrued and unpaid thereon, and all other amounts owing or payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to be immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which
are hereby expressly waived by the Loan Parties; and

            (d) exercise on behalf of itself and the Lenders all rights and
remedies available to it and the Lenders under the Loan Documents, including,
without limitation, all rights and remedies existing under the Collateral
Documents and all rights and remedies against any Guarantor;

provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an
order for relief with respect to any Consolidated Party under the Bankruptcy
Code of the United States, the obligation of each Lender to make Loans and any
obligation of the L/C Issuer to make L/C Credit Extensions shall automatically
terminate, the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest
and other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable, and
the obligation of the Borrower to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations as
aforesaid shall automatically become effective, in each case without further act
of the Administrative Agent or any Lender.

      SECTION 8.03 APPLICATION OF FUNDS. After the exercise of remedies provided
for in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become immediately
due and payable and the L/C Obligations have automatically been required to be
Cash Collateralized as set forth in the proviso to Section 8.02), any amounts
received by the Administrative Agent on account of the Obligations shall be
applied by the Administrative Agent in the following order:

      First, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities, expenses and other amounts (including fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent, but excluding any
principal or interest on any Loan) and amounts payable

                                       125
<PAGE>

under Article III hereof and Article XI hereof payable to the Administrative
Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation in its capacity as
Collateral Agent);

      Second, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting fees,
indemnities and other amounts (other than principal, interest, Commitment Fees
and Letter of Credit Fees) payable to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (including
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel to the respective Lenders and the L/C
Issuer (including fees and time charges for attorneys who may be employees of
any Lender or of the L/C Issuer)) and amounts payable under Article III hereof
and Article XI hereof, ratably among them in proportion to the respective
amounts described in this clause Second payable to them;

      Third, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting accrued
and unpaid Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees and interest on the Loans and
L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders and the L/C Issuer in proportion to
the respective amounts described in this clause Third payable to them;

      Fourth, ratably (i) to the payment of that portion of the Obligations
constituting unpaid principal of the Loans (other than Tranche D Term Loans) and
the L/C Borrowings, ratably among the Lenders (other than the Tranche D Term
Lenders) in proportion to the respective amounts described in this subclause (i)
to this clause Fourth held by them, (ii) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of the L/C Issuer, to Cash Collateralize that portion of L/C Obligations
comprised of the aggregate undrawn amount of Letters of Credit, and (iii) to the
payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting amounts owing under or
in respect of Secured Swap Contracts and Secured Cash Management Services
Agreements, ratably among the Swap Banks and the Cash Management Banks in
proportion to the respective amounts described in this subclause (iii) to this
clause Fourth held by them;

      Fifth, to payment of that portion of the Obligations constituting unpaid
principal of the Tranche D Term Loans; and

      Last, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations have been paid in
full in cash, to the Borrower or as otherwise required by Law.

Subject to Section 2.03(c), amounts used to Cash Collateralize the aggregate
undrawn amount of Letters of Credit pursuant to clause Fourth above shall be
applied to satisfy drawings under such Letters of Credit as they occur. If any
amount remains on deposit as Cash Collateral after all Letters of Credit have
either been fully drawn or expired, such remaining amount shall be applied to
the other Obligations, if any, in the order set forth above.

      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 8.03
(or in Section 2.13), at any time after the Notes have been accelerated and
become due and payable pursuant to Section 8.02 or otherwise, (i) whenever any
payment received by the Administrative Agent in respect of the proceeds of any
Collateral (other than the SCC Collateral or any other Investments in non-voting
participation certificates of any Lender described on Schedule 5.08) is
insufficient to pay amounts then due and payable to all the Lenders as provided
pursuant to clauses Third and Fourth above, then no amount of such payment or
any similar payment shall be paid to any Tranche D Term Lender until all such
amounts due and payable to the other Lenders are paid in

                                       126
<PAGE>

full, and all such payment and any similar payment shall be paid to the Lenders
other than the Tranche D Term Lenders pursuant to said clauses Third and Fourth
above, (ii) whenever any payment received by the Administrative Agent in respect
of the proceeds of the SCC Collateral (or received by any Tranche D Term Lender
in connection with any exercise of setoff rights by the Tranche D Term Lenders
against the SCCs), all such payment and any similar payment shall be paid to the
Tranche D Term Lenders (and not to any other Lender or the L/C issuer) until all
amounts due and payable to the Tranche D Term Lenders are paid in full and (iii)
whenever any payment is received by the Administrative Agent in respect of the
proceeds of any non-voting participation certificate in any Lender in which the
Loan Parties have invested as described in Schedule 5.08 (or received by such
Lender in connection with any exercise of setoff rights by such Lender against
such non-voting participation certificates) is insufficient to pay amounts then
due and payable to all Lenders as provided pursuant to clauses First, Second,
Third and Fourth above, then all such payments shall instead be paid to such
Lender (and not any other Lenders) for application to the Loans of such Lender
(and such Lender's right to receive any remaining amounts in respect of other
Collateral pursuant to clauses Third and Fourth above shall be reduced by a
corresponding amount). At any time after the exercise of any remedy provided for
in Section 8.02 (or after the Loans have automatically become due and payable),
(A) the Tranche D Term Lenders may exercise any right of setoff as the Tranche D
Term Lenders may have against the SCCs and (B) any Lender with any setoff rights
against any non-voting participation certificates of such Lender which are part
of the Collateral may exercise such right of setoff against such non-voting
participation certificates.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                    GUARANTY

      SECTION 9.01 GUARANTY; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

            (a) Each Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the punctual payment when due, whether at scheduled
maturity or on any date of a required prepayment or by acceleration, demand or
otherwise, of all Obligations of the Borrower and each other Guarantor now or
hereafter existing under or in respect of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, any extensions, modifications,
substitutions, amendments or renewals of any or all of the foregoing
Obligations), whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and whether
for principal, interest, premiums, fees, indemnities, contract causes of action,
costs, expenses or otherwise (such Obligations being the "Guarantied
Obligations"), and agrees to pay any and all reasonable expenses (including,
without limitation, Enforcement Expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent
or any other Secured Party in enforcing any rights under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the
Guarantied Obligations and would be owed by any other Loan Party to any Secured
Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents but for the fact that they are
unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding involving such other Loan Party.

            (b) Each Guarantor and the Administrative Agent and each other
Secured Party hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such Persons that
this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder not constitute a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance for

                                       127
<PAGE>

purposes of Debtor Relief Laws, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the
Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar Law to the extent applicable to
this Guaranty and the Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder. To effectuate the
foregoing intention, the Administrative Agent, the other Secured Parties and the
Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree that the Obligations of each Guarantor
(other than Holdings) under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the
maximum amount as will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under this
Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

            (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
that in the event any payment shall be required to be made to any Secured Party
under this Guaranty, such Guarantor will contribute, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, such amounts to each other Guarantor so as to maximize the
aggregate amount paid to the Secured Parties under or in respect of the Loan
Documents.

      SECTION 9.02 GUARANTY ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor guarantees that the
Guarantied Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, regardless of any Law now or
hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the
rights of any Secured Party with respect thereto. The Obligations of each
Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guarantied
Obligations or any other Obligations of any other Loan Party under or in respect
of the Loan Documents, and a separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted against each Guarantor to enforce this Agreement, irrespective of
whether any action is brought against the Borrower or any other Loan Party or
whether the Borrower or any other Loan Party is joined in any such action or
actions. This Guaranty is a present and continuing, absolute and unconditional
guaranty of payment when due, and not of collection, by each Guarantor jointly
and severally with any other Guarantor of the Guarantied Obligations. The
liability of each Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute
and unconditional irrespective of, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any defenses it may now have or
hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

            (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Loan Document or
any agreement or instrument relating thereto;

            (b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any
other term of, all or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Obligations
of any other Loan Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document,
including, without limitation, any increase in the Guarantied Obligations
resulting from the extension of additional credit to any Loan Party or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise;

            (c) any taking, exchange, release, subordination or non-perfection
of any Collateral or any other collateral, or any taking, release, subordination
or amendment or waiver of, or consent to departure from, any other guaranty, for
all or any of the Guarantied Obligations;

            (d) any manner of application of Collateral or any other collateral,
or proceeds thereof, to all or any of the Guarantied Obligations, or any manner
of sale or other disposition of any Collateral or any other collateral for all
or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any other

                                       128
<PAGE>

Obligations of any Loan Party under the Loan Documents or any other assets of
any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries;

            (e) any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate
structure or existence of any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting the
Borrower or any other Loan Party or its assets or any resulting release or
discharge of any Guarantied Obligation;

            (f) the existence of any claim, setoff or other right which any
Guarantor may have at any time against any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent,
any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or with any
unrelated transaction;

            (g) any provision of applicable Law purporting to prohibit the
payment or performance by any Loan Party of the Guarantied Obligations;

            (h) any failure of any Secured Party to disclose to any Loan Party
any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party now or
hereafter known to such Secured Party (each Guarantor waiving any duty on the
part of the Secured Parties to disclose such information);

            (i) the failure of any other Person to execute or deliver this
Agreement or any other guaranty or agreement or the release, subordination or
reduction of liability of any Guarantor or other guarantor or surety with
respect to the Guarantied Obligations; or

            (j) any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any
statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by
any Secured Party that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a
discharge of, any Loan Party or any other guarantor or surety.

      This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case
may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guarantied Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by any Secured Party or any other Person
upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Borrower or any other
Loan Party or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

      SECTION 9.03 WAIVERS AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

            (a) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, promptness, diligence, notice of
acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance,
default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to
any of the Guarantied Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that any
Secured Party protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien or any property
subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against any Loan Party
or any other Person or any Collateral.

            (b) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, any right to revoke this Guaranty and
acknowledges that this

                                       129
<PAGE>

Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guarantied Obligations,
whether existing now or in the future.

            (c) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) any defense arising by reason of any
claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any Secured Party that in
any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights
of such Guarantor or other rights of such Guarantor to proceed against any of
the other Loan Parties, any other guarantor or any other Person or any
Collateral and (ii) any defense based on any right of setoff or counterclaim
against or in respect of the Obligations of such Guarantor hereunder.

            (d) Each Guarantor acknowledges that the Administrative Agent may,
without notice to or demand upon such Guarantor and without affecting the
liability of such Guarantor under this Guaranty, foreclose under any mortgage by
nonjudicial sale to the extent permitted by applicable Law, and each Guarantor
hereby waives, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any defense to the
recovery by the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties against such
Guarantor of any deficiency after such nonjudicial sale and any defense or
benefits that may be afforded by applicable Law.

            (e) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any
duty on the part of any Secured Party to disclose to such Guarantor any matter,
fact or thing relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise),
operations, performance, properties or prospects of any other Loan Party or any
Subsidiaries now or hereafter known by such Secured Party.

            (f) Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial
direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and that the waivers set forth in
Section 9.02 and this Section 9.03 are knowingly made in contemplation of such
benefits.

      SECTION 9.04 SUBORDINATION. (a) Each Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter
acquire against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other insider
guarantor that arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of
such Guarantor's Obligations under or in respect of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution (pursuant to Section 9.01(c) or
otherwise) or indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or
remedy of any Secured Party against the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any
other insider guarantor or any Collateral, whether or not such claim, remedy or
right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including,
without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Borrower, any other
Loan Party or any other insider guarantor, directly or indirectly, in cash or
other property or by setoff or in any other manner, payment or security on
account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until the Termination Date
for such Guarantor has occurred.

            (b) Each Guarantor hereby agrees that any and all debts, liabilities
and other obligations owed to such Guarantor by each other Loan Party, including
pursuant to Section

                                       130
<PAGE>

9.01(c) (collectively, the "Subordinated Obligations"), are hereby subordinated
to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations of such other Loan Party
under the Loan Documents to the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth
in this Section 9.04(b):

                  (i) Except during the continuance of a Default under Section
      8.01(a) or (f) (including the commencement and continuation of any
      proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any other Loan Party)
      or an Event of Default, each Guarantor may receive regularly scheduled
      payments from any other Loan Party on account of the Subordinated
      Obligations. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any
      Default under Section 8.01(a) or (f) (including the commencement and
      continuation of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any
      other Loan Party) or an Event of Default, however, unless the
      Administrative Agent otherwise agrees in writing, no Guarantor shall
      demand, accept or take any action to collect any payment on account of the
      Subordinated Obligations.

                  (ii) In any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to
      any other Loan Party, each Guarantor agrees that the Secured Parties shall
      be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations
      (including all interest and expenses accruing after the commencement of a
      proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law, whether or not constituting an
      allowed claim in such proceeding ("Post Petition Interest")) before such
      Guarantor receives payment of any Subordinated Obligations.

                  (iii) After the occurrence and during the continuance of any
      Default under Section 8.01(a) or (f) (including the commencement and
      continuation of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any
      other Loan Party) or an Event of Default, each Guarantor shall, if the
      Administrative Agent so requests, collect, enforce and receive payments on
      account of the Subordinated Obligations as trustee for the Secured Parties
      and deliver such payments to the Administrative Agent for application to
      the Guarantied Obligations (including all Post Petition Interest),
      together with any necessary endorsements or other instruments of transfer,
      but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of such
      Guarantor under the other provisions of this Agreement.

                  (iv) After the occurrence and during the continuance of a
      Default under Section 8.01(a) or (f) (including the commencement and
      continuation of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law relating to any
      other Loan Party) or an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent is
      authorized and empowered (but without any obligation to so do), in its
      discretion, (A) in the name of any Guarantor, to collect and enforce, and
      to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated Obligations and to apply any
      amounts received thereon to the Guarantied Obligations (including any and
      all Post Petition Interest), and (B) to require any Guarantor (1) to
      collect and enforce, and to submit claims in respect of, Subordinated
      Obligations and (2) to pay any amounts received on such obligations to the
      Administrative Agent for application to the Guarantied Obligations
      (including any and all Post Petition Interest).

                                       131
<PAGE>

                  (v) In the event of any conflict between the provisions of
      this Section 9.04(b) and the provisions of any Intercompany Note, the
      provisions of this Section 9.04(b) shall govern.

            (c) If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of
this Section 9.04 at any time prior to the Termination Date for such Guarantor,
such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Secured
Parties, shall be segregated from other property and funds of such Guarantor and
shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Administrative Agent in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be
credited and applied to the Guarantied Obligations and all other amounts payable
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, or to be held as Collateral for any Guarantied Obligations or
other amounts payable under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
thereafter arising.

            (d) If the Termination Date for any Guarantor shall have occurred,
the Administrative Agent will, at such Guarantor's request and expense, execute
and deliver to such Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and
without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by
subrogation to such Guarantor of an interest in the Guarantied Obligations
resulting from such payment made by such Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.

      SECTION 9.05 CONTINUING GUARANTY. This Guaranty is a continuing agreement
of each Guarantor and shall: (a) remain in full force and effect until the
Termination Date for such Guarantor, (b) be binding upon such Guarantor, its
successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Secured Parties and their successors, transferees and assigns.

                              ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

      SECTION 10.01 APPOINTMENT AND AUTHORIZATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT.

            (a) Each of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereby irrevocably
appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation,
acting in such capacity, to act on its behalf as the Collateral Agent under the
Mortgages and the other Collateral Documents, and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may
be, by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are
reasonably incidental thereto. For these purposes, each reference to the
"Collateral Agent" in the Mortgages or other Collateral Documents shall be
deemed to be a reference to the "Administrative Agent". The provisions of this
Article, other than the provisions of Section 10.06, are solely for the benefit
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lenders and the L/C
Issuer, and, except as provided in Section 10.06, neither the Borrower nor any
other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such
provisions.

                                       132
<PAGE>

      SECTION 10.02 RIGHTS AS A LENDER. The Person serving as the Administrative
Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a
Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Loan Parties or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and
without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

      SECTION 10.03 EXCULPATORY PROVISIONS. The Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in
the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent:

            (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

            (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law; and

            (c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other
Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the
failure to disclose, any information relating to the Loan Parties or any of
their Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as
the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

      The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or
such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 11.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall
be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Party
Representative, a Lender or the L/C Issuer.

      The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other

                                       133
<PAGE>

agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set
forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

      SECTION 10.04 RELIANCE BY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative
Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and
believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any
liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition
hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance of a Letter of Credit, that
by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or the L/C
Issuer, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory
to such Lender or the L/C Issuer unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice to the contrary from such Lender or the L/C Issuer prior to the
making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Loan Parties or
the Loan Party Representative), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

      SECTION 10.05 DELEGATION OF DUTIES. The Administrative Agent may perform
any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under
any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by
the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

      SECTION 10.06 RESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. The Administrative
Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders, the L/C
Issuer and the Loan Party Representative. Upon receipt of any such notice of
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent, so
long as no Event of Default then exists, of the Loan Party Representative, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, to appoint a successor, which
shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such
bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been
so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders
and the L/C Issuer, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above; provided that if the Administrative Agent shall
notify the Loan Party Representative and the Lenders that no qualifying Person
has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall nonetheless become
effective in accordance with such notice and (a) the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security
held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders or the L/C Issuer
under any of the

                                       134
<PAGE>

Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such
collateral security until such time as a successor Administrative Agent is
appointed) and (b) all payments, communications and determinations provided to
be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or
to each Lender and the L/C Issuer directly, until such time as the Required
Lenders, with the consent of the Loan Party Representative, if applicable,
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section.
Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired)
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Loan Party Representative and such successor. After the retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
the provisions of this Article and Section 11.04 shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent.

      Any resignation by Bank of America as Administrative Agent pursuant to
this Section shall also constitute its resignation as L/C Issuer, Swing Line
Lender and Collateral Agent. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, (a) such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C
Issuer, Swing Line Lender and Collateral Agent, (b) the retiring L/C Issuer,
Swing Line Lender and Collateral Agent shall be discharged from all of their
respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents,
and (c) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution
for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or
make other arrangements satisfactory to the retiring L/C Issuer to effectively
assume the obligations of the retiring L/C Issuer with respect to such Letters
of Credit.

      SECTION 10.07 NON-RELIANCE ON ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND OTHER LENDERS. Each
Lender and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each of the L/C Issuer and each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

      SECTION 10.08 NO OTHER DUTIES, ETC. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, none of the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents or the Document
Agents listed on the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or
responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except
in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender or the L/C Issuer hereunder and
except that each Lender and the L/C Issuer hereby authorize (a) the
Administrative Agent

                                       135
<PAGE>

and the Arrangers to make the joint determinations in Section 4.01, and (b) the
Arrangers to make the joint determinations in Section 4.01.

      SECTION 10.09 ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT MAY FILE PROOFS OF CLAIM. In case of
the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and
payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower)
shall be entitled and empowered to, and at the request of the Required Lenders
(or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as
the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under
the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.02 and 11.01), shall, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

            (a) file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other
Obligations that are owing and unpaid and file such other documents as may be
necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the L/C
Issuer and the Administrative Agent and their respective agents and counsel and
all other amounts due the Lenders, the L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent
under Sections 2.03(i) and (j), 2.09 and 11.04) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and

            (b) collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian,
receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official
in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and the L/C
Issuer to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that
the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly
to the Lenders and the L/C Issuer, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount
due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.09 and 11.04.

      Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative
Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or
the L/C Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or to
authorize the Administrative Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender
in any such proceeding.

      SECTION 10.10 COLLATERAL AND GUARANTY MATTERS. (a) Each Lender and the L/C
Issuer irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its
discretion,

                  (i) to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by
      the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document (A) upon termination of
      the Commitments and payment in full of all Obligations (other than
      contingent indemnification obligations) and the expiration, termination or
      Cash Collateralization of all Letters of Credit, (B) that is sold or to be
      sold as part of or in connection with any sale

                                       136
<PAGE>

      permitted hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or (C) subject to
      Section 11.01, if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
      Required Lenders;

                  (ii) to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or
      held by the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document to the holder of
      any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 7.01(j); and

                  (iii) to release any Loan Party from its obligations under the
      Loan Documents if such Person ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a
      result of a transaction permitted hereunder.

            (b) Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the
Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to
release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of property, or
to release any Loan Party from its obligations under the Loan Documents pursuant
to this Section 10.10.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      SECTION 11.01 AMENDMENTS, ETC. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and no consent to any departure by
the Borrower or any other Loan Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders, the Loan
Party Representative on behalf of all Loan Parties or the applicable Loan
Parties, as the case may be, and acknowledged by the Administrative Agent (which
acknowledgement shall be provided at the direction of the Required Lenders),
then each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, however, that
no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

            (a) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01(a) without the
written consent of each Lender;

            (b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate

longer than six months, in each case, without the written consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby;

            (d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified
herein on, any Loan or L/C Borrowing, or (subject to clause (vii) of the second
proviso to this Section 11.01) any fees or other amounts payable hereunder or
under any other Loan Document without the written consent of each Lender
directly affected thereby; provided, however, that only the consent of the
Required Lenders shall be necessary (i) to amend the definition of "Default
Rate" or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at the Default
Rate or (ii) subject to clause (h), to amend any financial covenant hereunder
(or any defined term used therein, including the

                                       137
<PAGE>

definition of "Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio") even if the effect of such
amendment would be to reduce the rate of interest on any Loan or L/C Borrowing
or to reduce any fee payable hereunder;

            (e) change Section 2.13 or Section 8.03 or the definition of
"Applicable Percentage" in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of
payments required thereby (or any other provision hereof regarding pro rata
treatment and sharing of payments) without the written consent of each Lender;

            (f) change any provision of this Section or the definition of
"Required Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or

2.05(b)(iv), without the prior written consent of the Term Lenders holding at
least a majority of the Total Outstanding Amount of each Tranche of the Term
Facility and the Required Revolving Lenders;

            (i) effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms
adversely affects the rights, in respect of payments, the Collateral or the
Guaranty, of the Lenders holding Loans or Commitments comprising any Tranche of
the Term Loan Facility differently from those of the Lenders holding Loans or
Commitments comprising any other Tranche of the Term Loan Facility without the
prior written consent of Lenders holding in the aggregate at least a majority of
the Total Outstanding Amount of each Tranche of the Term Facility that is
adversely affected;

            (j) effect any waiver, amendment or modification that by its terms

written consent of the Required Revolving Lenders if the Revolving Lenders are
adversely affected, and Term Lenders holding at least a majority of the Total
Outstanding Amount of each Tranche of the Term Facility if the Term Lenders of
such Tranche are adversely affected; or

            (k) effect any waiver of a Default or Event of Default or any
waiver, amendment or modification of Section 4.02 that would have the effect of
requiring the Revolving Lenders in any manner to increase the Outstanding Amount

Extension is requested) by any amount in excess of

                                       138
<PAGE>

the Total Revolving Outstandings that the Revolving Lenders would otherwise be

                  (i) if to any Loan Party, the Loan Party Representative, the
      Administrative Agent, any other Agent, the L/C Issuer or the Swing Line
      Lender, to the address, telecopier number, electronic mail address or

Notices sent by hand or overnight courier service, or mailed, shall be deemed to
have been given when received; notices sent by telecopier shall be deemed to

            (b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to
the Lenders and the L/C Issuer hereunder may be delivered or furnished by
electronic communication (including e-mail and Internet or intranet websites)
pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the
foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender or the L/C Issuer, as
applicable, pursuant to Article II if such Lender has notified the
Administrative Agent that it is incapable of receiving notices under such
Article by electronic communication. The Administrative Agent or the Loan Party
Representative may, in its discretion, agree to accept notices and other
communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

      Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and
other communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the
sender's receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by
the "return receipt requested" function, as available, return e-mail or other

deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in
the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is

<PAGE>

FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE LOAN PARTY MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR
FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOAN PARTY MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event
shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the
"Administrative Agent Parties") have any liability to the Borrower, any other
Loan Party, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any other Person for losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) arising out of any Loan Party's or the Administrative Agent's
transmission of Loan Party Materials through the Internet, except to the extent
that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Administrative
Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Administrative Agent
Party have any liability to any Loan Party, any Lender, the L/C Issuer or any
other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).

            (d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Loan Parties, the Loan Party
Representative, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Swing Line
Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and

Lender (other than the Swing Line Lender) may change its address, telecopier or
telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the
Loan Party Representative, the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the
Swing Line Lender.

            In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent
from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an
effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and
electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may he sent
and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender.

            (e) Reliance by Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and Lenders.
The Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer and the Lenders shall be entitled to
rely and act upon any notices (including telephonic Loan Notices and Swing Line
Loan Notices) purportedly given by or on behalf of any Loan Party or by the Loan
Party Representative even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner
specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other
form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the
recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer, each Lender and the Related Parties of
each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the
reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of any
Loan Party or by the Loan Party Representative (in the absence of gross
negligence or willful misconduct by the applicable indemnitee). All telephonic
notices to and other telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may
be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents to such recording.

      SECTION 11.03 NO WAIVER; CUMULATIVE REMEDIES. No failure by any Lender,
the L/C Issuer or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such
Person in exercising,

                                       141
<PAGE>

any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,
powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.

      SECTION 11.04 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY; DAMAGE WAIVER.

            (a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable

facilities provided for herein, the preparation, negotiation, execution,
delivery and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or
any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof,
including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout,
restructuring or negotiations in respect of the Loans made or Letters of Credit
issued hereunder (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
shall be consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the L/C Issuer in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension
of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all

Lender or the L/C Issuer (including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), and shall
pay all reasonable fees and time charges for attorneys who may be employees of
the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default (A) in connection with this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or (B) in
connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder (all of
such expenses in this clause (iii) are sometimes referred to herein as
"Enforcement Expenses"); provided, however, that in the case of reimbursement of
outside counsel for Lenders, other than outside counsel for the Administrative
Agent, such reimbursement shall be limited to one counsel for all such Lenders.

            (b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify
the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof), each Lender and the L/C
Issuer, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person
being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from,
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee), and shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee from all
reasonable fees and time charges and disbursements for attorneys who may be
employees of any Indemnitee, incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any
Indemnitee by any third party or by the Borrower or any other Loan Party arising
out of, in connection with, or as a result of any actual or prospective claims,
litigation, actions, proceedings or investigations arising out of or relating to
the following (whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether
brought by a third party or by any other Loan Party, and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto, in all cases, whether or not caused by or
arising, in whole or in part, out of the comparative, contributing or sole
negligence of the Indemnitee): (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or
thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations
hereunder or

                                       142
<PAGE>

thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof)
and its Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use or proposed use of
the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the L/C Issuer to honor a
demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in
connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter
of Credit), or (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous
Materials on or from any property owned or operated by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) result from a claim
brought by any Loan Party against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such
Indemnitee's obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if such
Loan Party has obtained a final and nonappealable judgment in its favor on such
claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

            (c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower and
the Guarantors for any reason fail to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section or Section 9.01(a), as applicable, to be
paid by them to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof), the L/C
Issuer or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender under each
Facility severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent), the L/C Issuer or such Related Party, as the case may be, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of the Applicable Facility
Percentage for such Facility of such unpaid amount; provided that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or the L/C Issuer in its capacity
as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or L/C Issuer in connection with
such capacity and; provided, further, that the Lenders shall not be required to
pay any amount under this Section 11.04(c) in respect of any unpaid fees due to
the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Related Party under the Fee
Letter (and Section 2.09(b)) and; provided further, that no Lender that is not a
Revolving Lender shall be required to reimburse any amounts due to the L/C
Issuer. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to
the provisions of Section 2.12(e).

            (d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Loan Parties shall not assert, and hereby
waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or Letter of
Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in
subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by
unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems
in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby so long as such Indemnitee has
otherwise complied with the

                                       143
<PAGE>

provisions of Section 11.07. Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the Loan Parties agree not to assert and to cause
their Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby waive and agree to cause their
Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for contribution or any other rights of
recovery with respect to all claims, demands, penalties, fines, liabilities,
settlements, damages, costs and expenses of whatever kind or nature, under or
related to Environmental Laws, that any of them might have by statute or
otherwise against any Indemnitee (other than any thereof determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee).

            (e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
not later than ten Business Days after demand therefor.

            (f) Survival. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
resignation of the Administrative Agent and the L/C Issuer, the replacement of
any Lender, the termination of the aggregate Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all the other Obligations.

      SECTION 11.05 PAYMENTS SET ASIDE. To the extent that any payment by or on
behalf of the Loan Parties is made to the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer
or any Lender, or the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or any Lender
exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff
or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuer or such Lender in its
discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in
connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then
(a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b)
each Lender and the L/C Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its Applicable Percentage (without duplication) of any amount
so recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon
from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per
annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect. The
obligations of the Lenders and the L/C Issuer under clause (b) of the preceding
sentence shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

      SECTION 11.06 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

            (a) Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding

            remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment under any
            Facility and the Loans at the time owing to it under such Facility
            or in the case of an assignment under a Facility to a Lender under
            such Facility or an Affiliate of such a Lender or an Approved Fund
            with respect to such a Lender, the aggregate amount of the
            Commitment under any Facility (which for this purpose includes Loans

            Loan or a Term Loan and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
            and is continuing, the Loan Party Representative on behalf of the
            Borrower in the case of any assignment of a Revolving Loan,
            otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
            withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments
            to members of an Assignee Group and ------- concurrent assignments
            from members of an Assignee Group to a single Eligible Assignee (or
            to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee Group) will be
            treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining whether
            such minimum amount has been met;

                        (B) each partial assignment under a Facility shall be
            made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
            Lender's rights and obligations with respect to such Facility under
            this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment assigned,

            Facility must be approved by the Administrative Agent, the L/C
            Issuer and the Swing Line Lender (such approval to be not
            unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the Person that is the
            proposed assignee is itself a Lender under the Revolving Facility
            (whether or not the proposed assignee would otherwise qualify as an
            Eligible Assignee);

                        (D) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
            deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,

            Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
            Questionnaire; and

                        (E) any assignment of any Tranche C Term Loans by RTFC
            to any Eligible Assignee pursuant to this subsection (b)(i) shall be
            subject to the conversion provisions of subsection (b)(iii) of this
            Section.

                  (ii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
      Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and
      after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption
      (other than an Assignment and Assumption in respect of an assignment
      described under subsection (b)(i)(E) of this Section), the Eligible
      Assignee thereunder shall be a party to this Agreement and, to the extent
      of the interest under each Facility assigned by such Assignment and
      Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under such
      Facility under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
      to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption,
      be released from its obligations under such Facility under this Agreement
      (and, in the case of such an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the
      assigning Lender's rights and obligations under any Facility under this
      Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto in respect of such
      Facility but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
      3.01, 3.04, 3.05, 11.04 and 11.05 with respect to facts and circumstances
      occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment).

                  (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the
      Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, from and
      after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Assumption
      between RTFC, as assignor of all or a portion of the then outstanding
      Tranche C Term Loans (the "Subject Tranche C Term Loans"), and the
      Eligible Assignee thereunder, (A) such Eligible Assignee shall be a party
      to this Agreement, (B) if there are Tranche C Term Loans of both Types
      then outstanding, unless otherwise specified in such Assignment and
      Assumption, the assignment of the Subject Tranche C Term Loans shall be
      deemed to be an assignment (1) first, of RTFC Variable Rate Loans, to the
      extent of the outstanding amount thereof, and (2) next, of RTFC Fixed Rate
      Loans with an Interest Period which are next scheduled to expire, to the
      extent of the outstanding amount thereof (and each such Tranche C Term
      Borrowing which had previously included any portion of the Subject Tranche
      C Term Loans shall be reduced by a corresponding amount for all purposes
      of this Agreement), (C) such Subject Tranche C Term Loans shall be
      converted for all purposes of this Agreement into an equal principal
      amount of Tranche B Term Loans, (D) so that such

                                       146
<PAGE>

      Eligible Assignee shall hold its Applicable Percentage of the Outstanding
      Amount of the Tranche B Term Loans of each Type and, in the case of such
      Loans which are Eurodollar Rate Loans, of each applicable Interest Period,
      each Tranche B Term Borrowing which is then outstanding should be deemed
      to have been increased by an amount equal to the product of (1) a fraction
      (x) the numerator of which is the principal amount of such Tranche B Term
      Borrowing (before giving effect to any such increase) and (y) the
      denominator of which is the Total Outstanding Amount of Tranche B Term
      Loans (before giving effect to the conversion of the Subject Tranche C
      Term Loans), multiplied by (2) the principal amount of the Subject Tranche
      C Loans, and such Eligible Assignee shall be deemed to hold its Applicable
      Percentage of each such Tranche B Term Borrowing, as so increased, and (E)
      in the case of such an Assignment and Assumption covering all of RTFC's
      rights and obligations under the Tranche C Term Facility, RTFC shall cease
      to be a party hereto in respect of such Facility but shall continue to be
      entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01, 3.04, 11.04 and 11.05 with
      respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date
      of such assignment.

                  (iv) Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute
      and deliver the applicable Notes to the assignee Lender.

                  (v) Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
      obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection
      shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender
      of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
      subsection (d) of this Section.

            (c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this
purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at the Administrative
Agent's Office a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a
register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitments of, and principal amounts of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to,
each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the other Loan
Parties, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by each of the Loan
Party Representative and the L/C Issuer at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition, at any time that a request for a
consent for a material or other substantive change to the Loan Documents is
pending, any Lender may request and receive from the Administrative Agent a copy
of the Register.

            (d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Loan Parties, the Loan Party Representative or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural
person or Holdings or any of Holdings' Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a
"Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and/or obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the
Loans (including in the case of a Revolving Lender such Lender's participations
in L/C Obligations and/or Swing Line Loans) owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Loan Parties, the Loan Party

                                       147
<PAGE>

Representative, the Administrative Agent, the other Lenders and the L/C Issuer
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 11.01 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this
Section, the Loan Parties agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of
this Section, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.06 as
though it were a Lender. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant also
shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.08 as though it were a Lender;
provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.13 as though it were
a Lender.

            (e) Limitation on Rights of Participants. A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Loan Party Representative's (on behalf of the
Borrower) prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Non-Corporate
Domestic Lender or a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to
the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the Loan Party Representative is notified of
the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the
benefit of the Loan Parties, to comply with Section 3.01 as though it were a
Lender.

            (f) Pledge of Interests. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign
a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank and including, in the case of any Lender that is a Fund, that such Lender
may pledge or collaterally assign all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement (including under its Note, if any), to any holder of, or trustee for,
or any other representative of holders of, obligations owed or securities issued
by such Fund, as security for obligations of such Fund or such securities;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of
its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto.

            (g) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words "execution,"
"signed," "signature," and words of like import in any Assignment and Assumption
shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in
electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based
recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in
any applicable Law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and
National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act,
or any other similar state Laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act.

                                       148

            (h) Special Purpose Funding Vehicles. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "Granting Lender") may grant to a
special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time
by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party
Representative (an "SPC") the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that
such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any
SPC to fund any Loan, and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or
otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall
be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof or, if it fails to
do so, to make such payment to the Administrative Agent as is required under
Section 2.12(c). Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) neither the grant to
any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or
expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Loan Parties
under this Agreement (including their obligations under Sections 3.01 and 3.04),
(ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation
under this Agreement for which a Lender would be liable, and (iii) the Granting
Lender shall for all purposes, including the approval of any amendment, waiver
or other modification of any provision of any Loan Document, remain the lender
of record hereunder. The making of a Loan by an SPC hereunder shall utilize the
Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Loan were
made by such Granting Lender. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto
hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement)
that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full
of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior debt of any SPC, it will not
institute against, or join any other Person in instituting against, such SPC any
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, or liquidation proceeding
under the Laws of the United States or any State thereof. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, any SPC may (i) with notice to the
Loan Party Representative and the Administrative Agent, but without prior
consent of the Loan Parties, the Loan Party Representative or the Administrative
Agent and with the payment of a processing fee in the amount of $2,500, assign
all or any portion of its right to receive payment with respect to any Loan to
the Granting Lender and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public
information relating to its funding of Loans to any rating agency, commercial
paper dealer or provider of any surety or Guarantee or credit or liquidity
enhancement to such SPC.

            (i) Resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender after Assignment.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at any time Bank
of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant to subsection (b)
above, Bank of America may, (i) upon 30 days' notice to the Loan Party
Representative and the Revolving Lenders, resign as L/C Issuer and/or (ii) upon
30 days' notice to the Loan Party Representative, resign as Swing Line Lender.
In the event of any such resignation as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, the
Loan Party Representative shall be entitled to appoint, subject to acceptance by
such Lender, from among the Revolving Lenders a successor L/C Issuer or Swing
Line Lender hereunder; provided, however, that no failure by the Loan Party
Representative to appoint any such successor shall affect the resignation of
Bank of America as L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as the case may be. If Bank
of America resigns as L/C Issuer, it shall retain all the rights and obligations
of the L/C Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as
of the effective date of its resignation as L/C Issuer and all L/C Obligations
with respect thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Base
Rate Loans or fund risk participations in Unreimbursed Amounts pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)). If Bank of America resigns as Swing Line

                                       149
<PAGE>

Lender, it shall retain all rights of the Swing Line Lender provided for
hereunder with respect to Swing Line Loans made by it and outstanding as of the
effective date of such resignation, including the right to require the Revolving
Lenders to make Base Rate Loans or fund risk participations in outstanding Swing
Line Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(c). Upon the appointment of a successor L/C
Issuer and/or Swing Line Lender, subject to acceptance of such appointment by
such successor (a) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of
the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring L/C Issuer or Swing
Line Lender, as the case may be, and (b) the successor L/C Issuer shall issue
letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding
at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to Bank
of America to effectively assume the obligations of Bank of America with respect
to such Letters of Credit.

      SECTION 11.07 TREATMENT OF CERTAIN INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. Each of
the Administrative Agent, the other Agents, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its Affiliates and to its and
its Affiliates' partners, directors, officers, employees, advisors and
representatives solely in connection with the administration of its rights and
performance of its obligations hereunder (it being understood that the Persons
to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of
such Information, instructed to keep such Information confidential and informed
that the Loan Parties will be permitted to rely on their agreement to maintain
such confidentiality as herein provided), (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority purporting to have authority over it (including any
self-regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable Law or regulations or
by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject
to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee
of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
(ii) any pledgee referred to in Section 11.06(f) or (iii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to the Loan Parties and their obligations, (g) with the consent of the
Loan Party Representative or (h) to the extent such Information (x) becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y)
becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer or
any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates. For
purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the
Loan Parties or any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates relating to any Loan
Party or any Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any
such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
the L/C Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Loan
Parties or any Subsidiary; provided that, in the case of information received
from the Loan Parties or any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates after the
date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as
confidential. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information
as provided in this Section 11.07 shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to
maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to
its own confidential information. Each of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders
and the L/C Issuer acknowledges that (a) the Information may include

                                       150
<PAGE>

material, non-public information concerning a Consolidated Party or a
Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures
regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such
material non-public information in accordance with applicable Law, including
Federal and state securities Laws.

      SECTION 11.08 RIGHT OF SETOFF. If an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, each Lender, the L/C Issuer and each of their respective
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, after
obtaining the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency)
at any time held and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing
by such Lender, the L/C Issuer or any such Affiliate to or for the credit or the
account of the Borrower or any other Loan Party against any and all of the
obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party now or hereafter existing under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or the L/C Issuer,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender or the L/C Issuer shall have made any
demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
obligations of the Borrower or such Loan Party may be contingent or unmatured or
are owed to a branch or office of such Lender or the L/C Issuer different from
the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness. The
rights of each Lender, the L/C Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) that such Lender, the L/C Issuer or their respective Affiliates may
have. Each of the L/C Issuer and each Lender agrees to notify the Loan Party
Representative and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and
application which it effects or which is effected by its Affiliate; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
setoff and application. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the consent of the
Administrative Agent shall not be required for any Tranche C Term Lender or
Tranche D Term Lender to exercise any set-off rights against the SCCs (or for
any other Lender with any set-off rights against any non-voting participation
certificates of such Lender owned by the Loan Parties to exercise such set-off
rights against any such non-voting participation certificates).

      SECTION 11.09 INTEREST RATE LIMITATION. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid
under the Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious
interest permitted by applicable Law (the "Maximum Rate"). If the Administrative
Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum
Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if
it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining
whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative
Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal
as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary
prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and
spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the
contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

      SECTION 11.10 COUNTERPARTS; INTEGRATION; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may
be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents constitute the entire contract among

                                       151
<PAGE>

the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all
previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

      SECTION 11.11 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or
other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or
therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Credit Extension, and shall continue in full
force and effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall
remain unpaid or unsatisfied or any Letter of Credit shall remain outstanding.

      SECTION 11.12 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby
and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

      SECTION 11.13 REPLACEMENT OF LENDERS. If (i) any Revolving Lender or
Tranche B Term Lender requests compensation under Section 3.04, (ii) a Loan
Party is required to pay any additional amount or indemnification to any Lender
or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
3.01, (iii) any Lender fails or refuses to consent to any amendment, waiver or
consent to the Loan Documents which is approved by the Required Lenders, (iv)
any Lender delivers a notice pursuant to Section 3.02 with respect to
circumstances that do not affect the other Lenders hereunder, or (v) any Lender
is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort,
upon notice from the Borrower or the Loan Party Representative to such Lender
and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 11.06), all of its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee
that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:

            (a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the
assignment fee specified in Section 11.06(b);

            (b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to
the outstanding principal of its Loans and, in the case of a Revolving Lender,
L/C Advances, accrued

                                       152
<PAGE>

interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from
the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest
and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

            (c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments thereafter; and

            (d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

      A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation
if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

      SECTION 11.14 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION; ETC.

            (a) GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

            (b) SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH LOAN PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SITTING IN NEW YORK COUNTY
AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF SUCH STATE,

OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR FOR
RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH
ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH NEW YORK STATE COURT
OR, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT.
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR
PROCEEDING SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY
SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY LENDER OR THE L/C ISSUER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING
ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT
AGAINST ANY LOAN PARTY OR ITS PROPERTIES IN THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

            (c) WAIVER OF VENUE. EACH LOAN PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION THAT IT
MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR

                                       153
<PAGE>

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY COURT REFERRED TO
IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF THIS SECTION. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DEFENSE OF AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH
COURT.

            (d) SERVICE OF PROCESS. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO
SERVICE OF PROCESS IN THE MANNER PROVIDED FOR NOTICES IN SECTION 11.02. NOTHING
IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO SERVE PROCESS IN
ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

      SECTION 11.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER
THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

      SECTION 11.16 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE
CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL
AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE
PARTIES.

      SECTION 11.17 USA PATRIOT ACT NOTICE. Each of the Administrative Agent
(for itself and not on behalf of any Lender) and each Lender hereby notifies the
Loan Parties that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III
of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), it is required to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies the Loan Parties, which
information includes the names and addresses of the Loan Parties and other
information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, to identify the Loan Parties in accordance with such Act.

      SECTION 11.18 LOAN PARTIES' REPRESENTATIVE. The Loan Parties at all times
shall have designated one of the Loan Parties to act as their agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (in such capacity, the "Loan Party
Representative") with such powers and discretion as are specifically delegated
to the Loan Party Representative by the terms of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto, including, without limitation, (a) to execute and deliver on behalf of
each Loan Party all notices

                                       154
<PAGE>

required or permitted by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents to be delivered by any Loan Party, including, without limitation, Loan
Notices and Swing Line Loan Notices on behalf of the Borrower, (b) to receive
notices on behalf of each of the Loan Parties, (c) to disburse funds credited to
the Borrower's Account to the Borrower or other Loan Party, as applicable, and
(d) to give consents and approvals and make elections on behalf of the Loan
Parties. Any action taken by the Loan Party Representative shall be deemed to
bind the Loan Parties and shall be deemed approved by the Loan Parties. The
Administrative Agent, the other Agents, the Lenders and the L/C Issuer (i) may
rely on any notice delivered by the Loan Party Representative on behalf of any
Loan Party and (ii) shall not have any responsibility for any actions as are
delegated to the Loan Party Representative hereunder. Any notice given by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender or the L/C Issuer to the Loan Party
Representative shall be deemed given to each Loan Party. Each Loan Party hereby
appoints and authorizes Holdings to be and act as the initial Loan Party
Representative. The Loan Parties may at any time replace the Loan Party
Representative with another Loan Party by delivering to the Administrative Agent
an appointment and authorization document executed by each Loan Party in form
and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Upon such delivery and
approval the Loan Party named in such document shall become the Loan Party
Representative as if such Loan Party were named the Loan Party Representative
herein.

      SECTION 11.19 CONFLICTS WITH MORTGAGES. In the case of any conflict
between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the terms and provisions
of any Mortgage, as amended, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
govern.
