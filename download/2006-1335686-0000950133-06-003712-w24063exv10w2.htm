liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Borrower&#146;s assets do not and,
immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably small capital to
carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to
incur debt and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its
ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing and amounts
of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of
Borrower). No petition under the Bankruptcy Code or similar state bankruptcy or insolvency law has

the term of this Assignment: (a)&nbsp;neither Borrower nor Manager shall transfer the responsibility for
the management of any Individual Property to any other person or entity without prior written
notification to Lender and the prior written consent of Lender, which consent may be withheld by
Lender in Lender&#146;s sole discretion; (b)&nbsp;neither Borrower nor Manager shall terminate or amend any
of the terms or provisions of the Management Agreement without the prior written consent of Lender,
which consent may be withheld in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement; and (c)&nbsp;Borrower
or Manager, as the case may be, shall, in the manner provided for in this Assignment, give notice
to Lender of any notice or information that Borrower or Manager, as the case may be, receives which

full force and effect and has not been modified, amended or assigned other than pursuant to this
Assignment, (b)&nbsp;neither Manager nor Borrower is in default under any of the terms, covenants or
provisions of the Management Agreement and Manager knows of no event which, but for the passage of

Agreement, (c)&nbsp;neither Manager nor Borrower has commenced any action or given or received any
notice for the purpose of terminating the Management Agreement and (d)&nbsp;the Management Fees and all
other sums due and payable to Manager under the Management Agreement as of the date hereof have

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<U>Agreement by Borrower and Manager; Lender&#146;s Right to Replace Manager</U>. Borrower and
Manager hereby agree that if (a)&nbsp;Manager shall become insolvent or a debtor in any bankruptcy or
insolvency proceeding, (b)&nbsp;there exists an Event of Default, or (c)&nbsp;there exists a default by
Manager (other than an Approved Manager) under the Management Agreement beyond any applicable
notice and cure periods during the term of this Assignment, then in any such event, at the option
of Lender exercised by written notice to Borrower and Manager, Lender may exercise its rights under
this Assignment and may immediately terminate the Management Agreement and require Manager to
transfer its responsibility for the management of the Property to a Qualified Manager pursuant to a
Replacement Management Agreement.

connection with this Assignment; and (b)&nbsp;that it shall, in the manner provided for in this
Assignment, give at least thirty (30)&nbsp;days prior written notice to Lender of its intention to

acknowledges that some, or all, permits, licenses and authorizations necessary for the use,

By executing this Assignment, Manager (i)&nbsp;agrees that it is holding or providing all such Permits
for the benefit of Borrower and (ii)&nbsp;hereby agrees that as security for the repayment of the Debt
by Borrower in accordance with the Loan Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
Manager hereby grants to Lender a security interest in and to the Permits. Moreover, Manager
hereby agrees that, upon an Event of Default, it will assign the Permits to Lender if such Permits
are assignable or otherwise continue to hold such Permits for the benefit of Lender until such time
as Lender can obtain such Permits in its own name or the name of a nominee.
