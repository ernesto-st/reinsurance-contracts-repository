            3-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT (as amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, this "Agreement" or the "Facility") dated
as of June 28, 2002 among AMERCO, a Nevada corporation (the "Borrower"), the
banks, financial institutions, and other entities listed in Schedule 2.01
(together with each entity which becomes a "Lender" pursuant to Section 10.04,
individually, a "Lender" and collectively, the "Lenders"), J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner ("JPMorgan" and, in
such capacity, the "Lead Arranger"), Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent
(in such capacity, the "Syndication Agent"), Bank One, NA, with its main office
in Chicago, Illinois, as Documentation Agent (in such capacity, the
"Documentation Agent") and JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, as administrative agent for the
Lenders ("JPMCB" and, in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent").

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

            WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested the Lenders to extend credit in
order to enable the Borrower, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, to borrow on a competitive basis or on a revolving basis, at any time
and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (as defined herein), in an
aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not in excess of the Total
Commitment (as defined herein), and the Lenders are willing to extend such
credit to the Borrower on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

            NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS:


ARTICLE I. DEFINITIONS

            SECTION 1.01. Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the meanings specified below:

            "ABR Borrowing" shall mean a Borrowing comprised of ABR Loans.

            "ABR Loan" shall mean any Committed Loan bearing interest at a rate
determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate in accordance with the
provisions of Article II.

            "Adjusted Capitalization" shall mean (a) Consolidated Tangible Net
Worth plus (b) Consolidated Indebtedness.

            "Adjusted LIBO Rate" shall mean, with respect to any Eurodollar
Borrowing for any Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards,
if necessary, to the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such
Interest Period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate.
<PAGE>
            "Adjusted Operating Earnings" shall mean for any period Consolidated
Net Income for such period plus (a) to the extent deducted in determining such
Consolidated Net Income, the sum of (i) extraordinary losses (net of any credits
against or reduction of Federal and state income taxes resulting from such
loss), determined in accordance with GAAP, (ii) depreciation and amortization,
(iii) all taxes on or measured by income, whether Federal, state, local or
otherwise, including any deferred portions thereof and (iv) all Fixed Charges,
less (b) to the extent added in determining such Consolidated Net Income,
extraordinary gains (net of any increases in Federal and state income taxes
resulting from such gain), determined in accordance with GAAP.

            "Administrative Questionnaire" shall mean an Administrative
Questionnaire in the form of Exhibit C.

            "Affiliate" shall mean, when used with respect to a specified
Person, another Person that directly, or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, Controls or is Controlled by or is under common Control with the
Person specified.

            "Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum
(rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next 1/100 of 1%) equal to the greater of
(a) the rate of interest publicly announced by the Administrative Agent as its
prime rate in effect at its principal office in New York City (the "Prime Rate")
on such day and (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus
0.5%. If for any reason the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that it is unable to
ascertain the Federal Funds Effective Rate for any reason, including the
inability or failure of the Administrative Agent to obtain sufficient quotations
in accordance with the terms of the definition thereof, the Alternate Base Rate
shall be determined without regard to clause (b) of the preceding sentence,
until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no longer exist. Any
change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime Rate or the
Federal Funds Effective Rate shall be effective on the effective date of such
change in the Prime Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate, respectively.

            "Annual Statement" shall mean, as to any Insurance Subsidiary, the
annual financial statement of such Insurance Subsidiary as required to be filed
with the Applicable Insurance Regulatory Authority, together with all exhibits
or schedules filed therewith, prepared in conformity with SAP. References to
amounts on particular exhibits, schedules, lines, pages, columns of the Annual
Statement are based on the format promulgated by the NAIC for 2001 Property and
Casualty Company Annual Statements. If such format is changed in future years so
that different information is contained in such items or they no longer exist,
it is understood that the reference is to information consistent with that
reported in the referenced item in the 2001 Annual Statement of such Insurance
Subsidiary.

            "Applicable Facility Fee Percentage" shall mean on any date the
applicable percentage set forth below based upon the ratings applicable on such
date to the Borrower's senior, unsecured, non-credit enhanced long term
indebtedness for borrowed money ("Index Debt"):

            For purposes of the foregoing, if the ratings established or deemed
to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Borrower's Index Debt shall
fall within different Rating Categories, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage
shall be based on the higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is
two or more Rating Categories lower than the other, in which case the Applicable
Facility Fee Percentage shall be determined by reference to the Rating Category
next above that of the lower of the two ratings. If the ratings established or
deemed to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Borrower's Index Debt
shall be changed (other than as a result of a change in the rating system of
Moody's or S&P), such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is
first announced by the applicable rating agency, irrespective of when notice of
such change shall have been furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative
Agent or a Lender. Each change in the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage shall
apply during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and
ending on the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such
change. If Moody's or S&P shall change its rating system, or if either such
rating agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt
obligations (any such event, a "Rating Event" and any such agency, a "Rating
Event Agency"), the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to
amend this definition to reflect such changed rating system or the
unavailability of ratings from such Rating Event Agency. Pending the
effectiveness of


                                       4

<PAGE>
any such amendment, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage shall be based on the
rating by the Rating Event Agency in effect immediately prior to the Rating
Event and the rating of the other rating agency in the manner set forth above.
If, other than as a result of a Rating Event, (i) either Moody's or S&P ceases
to rate the Borrower's Index Debt, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage shall
be based on the rating by the rating agency which has continued to rate the
Borrower's Index Debt and the lowest rating in the grid above for the rating
agency which has ceased to rate the Borrower's Index Debt in the manner set
forth above and (ii) both Moody's and S&P cease to rate the Borrower's Index
Debt, the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage shall be based on the lowest rating
in the grid above.

            "Applicable Insurance Regulatory Authority" shall mean, when used
with respect to any Insurance Subsidiary, the insurance department or similar
administrative authority or agency located in (a) each state in which such
Insurance Subsidiary is domiciled or (b) to the extent asserting regulatory
jurisdiction over such Insurance Subsidiary, the insurance department, authority
or agency in each state in which such Insurance Subsidiary is licensed, and
shall include any Federal insurance regulatory department, authority or agency
that may be created and that asserts regulatory jurisdiction over such Insurance
Subsidiary.

            "Applicable Law" shall mean all provisions of statutes, rules,
regulations and orders of governmental bodies or regulatory agencies applicable
to a Person, and all orders and decrees of all courts and arbitrators in
proceedings or actions in which the Person in question is a party.

            "Applicable Margin" shall mean on any date, with respect to the
Loans, the applicable spread set forth below (expressed as a percentage) based
upon the ratings applicable on such date to the Borrower's Index Debt:

            For purposes of the foregoing, if the ratings established or deemed
to have been established by Moody's and S&P for the Borrower's Index Debt shall
fall within different Rating Categories, the Applicable Margin shall be based on
the higher of the two ratings unless one of the two ratings is two or more
Rating Categories lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Margin
shall be determined by reference to the Rating Category next above that of the
lower of the two ratings. If the ratings established or deemed to have been
established by Moody's and S&P for the Borrower's Index Debt shall be changed
(other than as a result of a change in the rating system of Moody's or S&P),
such change shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by

have been furnished by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders.
Each change in the Applicable Margin shall apply during the period commencing on
the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding
the effective date of the next such change. If Moody's or S&P shall change its
rating system, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business
of rating corporate debt obligations (any such event, a "Rating Event" and any
such agency, a "Rating Event Agency"), the Borrower and the Lenders shall
negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating
system or the unavailability of ratings from such Rating Event Agency. Pending
the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be based


                                       6

<PAGE>
on the rating by the Rating Event Agency in effect immediately prior to the
Rating Event and the rating of the other rating agency in the manner set forth
above. If, other than as a result of a Rating Event, (i) either Moody's or S&P
ceases to rate the Borrower's Index Debt, the Applicable Margin shall be based
on the rating by the rating agency which has continued to rate the Borrower's
Index Debt and the lowest rating in the grid above for the rating agency which
has ceased to rate the Borrower's Index Debt in the manner set forth above and
(ii) both Moody's and S&P cease to rate the Borrower's Index Debt, the
Applicable Margin shall be based on the lowest rating in the grid above.

ARTICLE II. THE COMMITMENTS

            SECTION 2.01. Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions and
relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Lender
agrees, severally and not jointly, to make Committed Loans to the Borrower, at
any time and from time to time until the earlier of the Maturity Date and the
termination of the Commitment of such Lender in accordance with the terms
hereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding which shall not
exceed the Commitment set forth opposite its name in the Register, as such
Commitment may be reduced from time to time pursuant to Section 2.10 subject,
however, to the condition that at no time shall the sum of the outstanding
aggregate principal amount of all Loans made by all Lenders exceed the Total
Commitment.

            Within the limits set forth in the preceding paragraph, the Borrower
may borrow, pay or prepay and reborrow Committed Loans on or after the Closing
Date and prior to the Maturity Date, subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth herein.

            SECTION 2.02. Committed Loans.

            (a) Each Committed Loan shall be made as part of a Borrowing
consisting of Committed Loans made by the Lenders ratably in accordance with
their respective Commitments; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender
to make any Committed Loan shall not in itself relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder (it


                                       21
<PAGE>
being understood, however, that no Lender shall be responsible for the failure
of any other Lender to make any Committed Loan required to be made by such other
Lender). The Committed Loans comprising each Borrowing shall be in a minimum
aggregate principal amount of $10,000,000 (or an aggregate principal amount
equal to the remaining balance of the Commitments) and in an integral multiple
of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

            (b) Each Borrowing of Committed Loans shall be comprised entirely of
ABR Loans or Eurodollar Loans, as the Borrower may request pursuant to Section
2.02(f). Each Lender may at its option fulfill its Commitment with respect to
any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of
such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall
not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and any applicable Note. Borrowings of more than one
Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing which, if made, would result in
more than eight Interest Periods being outstanding hereunder at any one time.
For purposes of the foregoing, Loans having different Interest Periods,
regardless of whether they commence on the same date, shall be considered
separate Loans.

            (c) Subject to paragraph (e) below, each Lender shall make a
Committed Loan in the amount of its pro rata portion, as determined under
Section 2.15, of each Borrowing of Committed Loans hereunder on the proposed
date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
Administrative Agent in New York, New York, not later than 1:30 p.m., New York
City time, and the Administrative Agent shall by 3:00 p.m., New York City time,
credit the amounts so received to the general deposit account of the Borrower
with the Administrative Agent or, if a Borrowing shall not occur on such date
because any condition precedent herein specified shall not have been met, return
the amounts so received to the respective Lenders. Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the date of any
Borrowing of Committed Loans that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the
Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with this
paragraph (c) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.
If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have made such portion available
to the Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Administrative Agent at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Committed Loans comprising such Borrowing and (ii)
in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender
shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount
shall constitute such Lender's Committed Loan as part of such Borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement.


                                       22
<PAGE>
            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing if the Interest Period
requested with respect thereto would end after the Maturity Date.

            (e) The Borrower may elect to convert or continue all or any part of
any Borrowing of Committed Loans with a Borrowing of Committed Loans of the same
or a different Type, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this
Agreement. Any Borrowing of Committed Loans or part thereof so converted or
continued shall be deemed to be repaid or prepaid in accordance with Section
2.04 or 2.11, as applicable, with the proceeds of a new Borrowing of Committed
Loans, and the proceeds of the new Borrowing of Committed Loans, to the extent
they do not exceed the principal amount of the Borrowing of Committed Loans
being converted or continued, shall not be paid by the Lenders to the
Administrative Agent or by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower pursuant to
paragraph (c) above.

            (f) The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent written or
facsimile notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed in writing or by
facsimile) (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Committed Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before a proposed borrowing
and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 9:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the Business Day of a proposed borrowing. Such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall in each case refer to this Agreement and specify (i)
whether the Borrowing then being requested is to be a Eurodollar Committed
Borrowing or an ABR Borrowing; (ii) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a
Business Day) and the amount thereof; and (iii) if such Borrowing is to be a
Eurodollar Committed Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. If no
election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified in any such notice, then the
requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period with
respect to any Eurodollar Committed Borrowing is specified in any such notice,
then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month's duration. If the Borrower shall not have given notice in accordance with
this Section 2.02(f) of its election to convert or continue a Borrowing of
Committed Loans prior to the end of the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing, then the Borrower shall (unless such Borrowing is repaid at the end
of such Interest Period) be deemed to have given notice of an election to
convert or continue such Borrowing as an ABR Borrowing. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly advise the Lenders of any notice given or deemed given pursuant
to this Section 2.02(f), of each Lender's portion of the requested Borrowing of
Committed Loans and of the Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate applicable
to such Borrowing.

            SECTION 2.03. Competitive Loans.

Competitive Borrowing. No ABR Loan shall be requested in, or made pursuant to, a
Competitive Bid Request. A Competitive Bid Request that does not conform

Agent's sole discretion, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower of such rejection by telecopier. Each Competitive Bid Request shall
refer to this Agreement and specify (x) whether the Competitive Borrowing then
being requested is to be a Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing or a Fixed Rate
Competitive Borrowing, (y) the date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business
Day) and the aggregate principal amount thereof which shall be in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000, and (z) the Interest
Period with respect thereto, which may not end after the Maturity Date. Promptly

this Agreement, to make Competitive Loans pursuant to the Competitive Bid
Request.

            (b) Each Lender may, in its sole discretion, make one or more
Competitive Bids to the Borrower in response to a Competitive Bid Request. Each
Competitive Bid shall be in the form of Exhibit F-3 hereto and must be received

Fixed Rate Competitive Borrowing, not later than 11:30 a.m., New York City time,
on the day of a proposed Competitive Borrowing. Multiple bids will be accepted
by the Administrative Agent. Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially
to the format of Exhibit F-3 may be rejected by the Administrative Agent, and
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lender making such nonconforming bid
of such rejection as soon as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall refer to
this Agreement and specify (x) the principal amount (which shall be in a minimum
principal amount of $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and
which may equal the entire principal amount of the Competitive Borrowing
requested by the Borrower) of the Competitive Loan or Competitive Loans that the
Lender is willing to make to the Borrower, (y) the Competitive Bid Rate or
Competitive Bid Rates at which the Lender is prepared to make the Competitive
Loan or Competitive Loans and (z) the Interest Period thereof (which shall not
end after the Maturity Date applicable to such Lender). If any Lender shall fail
to deliver a conforming Competitive Bid to the Administrative Agent prior to the
date and time indicated in this paragraph (b), such Lender shall be deemed to
have elected not to make a Competitive Bid.

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower by
telecopier of all Competitive Bids made, the Competitive Bid Rate and the
principal amount of each proposed Competitive Loan in respect of which a
Competitive Bid was made, the Interest Period thereof and the identity of the
Lender that made each bid. The Administrative Agent shall send a copy of all

only to the provisions of this paragraph (d), accept or reject any Competitive
Bid referred to in paragraph (c) above. The Borrower shall notify the

Borrowing; provided, however, that (i) the failure by the Borrower to give such
notice prior to the date and time indicated in this paragraph shall be deemed to
be a rejection of all the bids referred to in paragraph (c) above, (ii) the
Borrower shall not accept a bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate if the
Borrower has decided to reject a bid made at a lower Competitive Bid Rate, (iii)
the aggregate amount of the Competitive Bids accepted by the Borrower shall not
exceed the principal amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request, (iv) if
the Borrower shall accept a bid or bids made at a particular Competitive Bid
Rate but the amount of such bid or bids shall cause the total amount of bids to
be accepted by the Borrower to exceed the amount specified in the Competitive
Bid Request, then the Borrower shall accept a portion of such bid or bids in an
amount equal to the amount specified in the Competitive Bid Request less the
amount of all other Competitive Bids accepted with respect to such Competitive
Bid Request, which partial acceptance, in the case of multiple bids at such
Competitive Bid Rate, shall be made pro rata in accordance with the amount of
each such bid at such Competitive Bid Rate, and (v) except pursuant to clause
(iv) above, no bid shall be accepted for a Competitive Loan unless such
Competitive Loan is in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 and an integral
multiple of $1,000,000; provided further, however, that if a Competitive Loan
must be in an amount less than $5,000,000 because of the provisions of clause
(iv) above, such Competitive Loan may be for a minimum of $1,000,000 or any
integral multiple thereof, and in calculating the pro rata allocation of
acceptances of portions of multiple bids at a particular Competitive Bid Rate
pursuant to clause (iv) the amounts shall be rounded to integral multiples of
$1,000,000 in a manner which shall be in the discretion of the Borrower. A
notice given by the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be
irrevocable. A Competitive Loan shall be extended to the Borrower only if (and
upon such extension of each Competitive Loan the Borrower shall be deemed to
represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such extension, the sum of
the total Committed Loans plus the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
Competitive Loans shall not exceed the Total Commitment.

            (e) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each bidding
Lender whether or not its Competitive Bid has been accepted (and if so, in what
amount and at what Competitive Bid Rate) by telecopier sent by the
Administrative Agent, and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound,
subject to the other applicable conditions hereof, to make the Competitive Loan
in respect of which its bid has been accepted by the time and in the manner set
forth in the first sentence of Section 2.02(c).

            (f) A Competitive Bid Request shall not be made within five Business
Days after the date of any previous Competitive Bid Request.


                                       25
<PAGE>
            (g) If the Administrative Agent shall elect to submit a Competitive
Bid in its capacity as a Lender, it shall submit such bid directly to the
Borrower not later than one quarter of an hour earlier than the latest time at
which the other Lenders are required to submit their bids to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to paragraph (b) above.

            (h) All notices required by this Section 2.03 shall be given in the
manner specified herein and otherwise in accordance with Section 10.01.

            SECTION 2.04. Notes; Repayment of Loans. The Loans made by each
Lender shall, upon request of a Lender, be evidenced by a Note duly executed on
behalf of the Borrower, dated the Closing Date, in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A, with the blanks appropriately filled, payable to
the order of such Lender. The outstanding principal balance of each Loan, as may
be evidenced by such a Note, shall be payable on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable to such Loan and on the Maturity Date. Each Loan shall bear
interest from the date of the first borrowing hereunder on the outstanding
principal balance thereof as set forth in Section 2.07. To the extent any Notes
have been issued, each Lender shall, and is hereby authorized by the Borrower
to, endorse on the schedule attached to each Note delivered to such Lender (or
on a continuation of such schedule attached to such Note and made a part
thereof), or otherwise to record in such Lender's internal records, an
appropriate notation evidencing the date and amount of each Loan from such
Lender, each payment and prepayment of principal of any such Loan, each payment
of interest on any such Loan and the other information provided for on such
schedule; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to make such a
notation or any error therein shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to
repay the Loans made by such Lender in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the applicable Notes.

            SECTION 2.05. Intentionally Omitted.

            SECTION 2.06. Fees.

            (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender, through the
Administrative Agent, on each February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 and
on the Maturity Date or the date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall be
terminated as provided herein, a facility fee (a "Facility Fee"), at a rate per
annum equal to the Applicable Facility Fee Percentage from time to time in
effect on the amount of Commitment of such Lender from time to time in effect,
whether used or unused, during the three-month period ending on such payment
date (or shorter period commencing with the Effective Date, or ending with the
Maturity Date or any date on which the Commitment of such Lender shall be
terminated). The Facility Fee due to each Lender shall commence to accrue on the
Effective Date and shall cease to accrue on the earlier of the Maturity Date and
the termination of the Commitment of such Lender as provided herein. For
purposes of calculating the Facility Fee, if the Commitments have been
terminated, the Facility Fee shall be payable on the outstanding principal
amount of the Loans.


                                       26
<PAGE>
            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent all fees
and other amounts as shall (i) be specified in writing by the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) otherwise be agreed to
in writing from time to time by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

            (c) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, if and as
appropriate, among the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. Once paid, none of
the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances. Except as otherwise
provided herein, all computations of Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

            SECTION 2.07. Interest on Loans.

            (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising
each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, when
determined by reference to the Prime Rate and over a year of 360 days at all
other times) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin minus 1.00%.

            (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising
each Eurodollar Committed Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per
annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.

            (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising
each Eurodollar Competitive Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per
annum equal to the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus or minus the Competitive Margin, as offered by the Lender and
accepted by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.03.

            (d) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, the Loans comprising
each Fixed Rate Competitive Borrowing shall bear interest (computed on the basis
of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) at a rate per
annum equal to the Fixed Rate offered by the Lender and accepted by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.03.

            (e) Interest on each Loan shall be payable on the Interest Payment
Dates applicable to such Loan except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or Fixed Rate for each
Interest Period or day within an Interest Period, as the case may be, shall be
determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.08. Additional Interest. If the Borrower shall default in
the payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount
becoming due hereunder, by acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower shall on
demand from time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on such
defaulted amount up to (but not


                                       27
<PAGE>
including) the date of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at a
rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over
a year of 360 days) equal to the rate applicable to ABR Loans plus 2.0% (the
"Default Rate").

            SECTION 2.09. Alternate Rate of Interest. In the event, and on each
occasion, that on the day two Business Days prior to the commencement of any
Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing the Administrative Agent shall have
determined that dollar deposits in the principal amounts of the Loans comprising
such Borrowing are not generally available in the London interbank market, or
that the rates at which such dollar deposits are being offered will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining
its Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar Competitive Loan during such Interest Period,
or that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate,
the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, give written
or facsimile notice of such determination to the Borrower and the Lenders. In
the event of any such determination, until the Administrative Agent shall have
advised the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, (i) any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar
Committed Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.02(f) shall be deemed to be a request
for an ABR Borrowing and (ii) any request by the Borrower for a Eurodollar
Competitive Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.03 shall be of no force or effect
and shall be rejected by the Administrative Agent. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.10. Termination and Reduction of Commitments.

            (a) The Commitments shall automatically terminate on the Maturity
Date.

            (b) Upon at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable written
notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole
permanently terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the
Total Commitment; provided, however, that (i) each partial reduction of the
Total Commitment shall be in a minimum principal amount of $10,000,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess of that amount and (ii) a partial
reduction shall not be permitted if, as a result thereof, the Total Commitment
would total less than $10,000,000.

            (c) Each reduction in the Commitments hereunder shall be made (i)
ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective applicable
Commitments and (ii) pro rata to each of the Guaranteed Portion and the
Non-Guaranteed Portion. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders, on the date of each termination or reduction, the
Fees on the amount of the Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued through
the date of such termination or reduction.

            (d) No termination or reduction of the Commitments hereunder shall
be made which would reduce the Total Commitment to an amount less than the
aggregate principal amount of the Loans then outstanding to the Borrower (after
giving effect to any principal payments made pursuant to Section 2.11(b) in
connection with such termination or reduction).


                                       28
<PAGE>
            SECTION 2.11. Prepayment.

            (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to
time to prepay any Borrowing (other than a Competitive Borrowing, which may only
be prepaid with the prior written consent of the relevant Lender), in whole or
in part, (i) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, upon at least three Business Days'
prior written notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice)
to the Administrative Agent and (ii) in the case of ABR Loans, upon written
notice (or telephone notice promptly confirmed by written notice) to the
Administrative Agent on the day of such prepayment; provided, however, that each
partial prepayment shall be in an amount of not less than $5,000,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each notice of prepayment
shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing (or
portion thereof) to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the
Borrower to prepay such Borrowing by the amount stated therein on the date
stated therein.

            (b) On the date of any pro-rata termination or reduction of the
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.10, the Borrower shall pay or prepay so much
of the Borrowings as shall be necessary in order that the aggregate principal
amount of the Loans outstanding will not exceed the aggregate Commitments after
giving effect to such termination or reduction.

            (c) All prepayments under this Section 2.11 shall (i) include
accrued interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of payment
and shall be applied to payment of interest before application to principal and
(ii) be subject to Section 2.14 but otherwise without premium or penalty.

            SECTION 2.12. Reserve Requirements; Change in Circumstances.

            (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if after the date of
this Agreement any change in applicable law or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof (whether or not having the
force of law) shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of
the principal of or interest on any Eurodollar Loan, Eurodollar Competitive Loan
or Fixed Rate Competitive Loan made by such Lender or any Fees or other amounts
payable hereunder (other than changes in respect of taxes imposed on the overall
net income of such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its
principal office or by any political subdivision or taxing authority therein),
or shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits, commitment of, with or for the
account of or credit extended by such Lender (except any such reserve
requirement which is reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or shall impose on
such Lender or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
Agreement or any Eurodollar Loan, Eurodollar Competitive Loan or Fixed Rate
Competitive Loan made by such Lender, and the result of any of the foregoing
shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any such
Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
hereunder or under the Notes (whether of principal, interest or otherwise) by an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then the Borrower will pay to such


                                       29
<PAGE>
Lender in accordance with Section 2.12(c) such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction
suffered.

            (b) If any Lender shall have determined that the applicability of
any law, rule, regulation, agreement or guideline adopted pursuant to or arising
out of the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and
Supervisory Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement
and Capital Standards", or the adoption after the date hereof of any other law,
rule, regulation, agreement or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any
change in any of the foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any
of the foregoing by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Lender (or any lending office of such Lender) or any Lender's holding
company with any request, guideline or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if
any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender
pursuant hereto to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding
company could have achieved but for such applicability, adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of
such Lender's holding company with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the Borrower shall
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

            (c) A certificate of each Lender setting forth such amount or
amounts as shall be necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company
as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) above, as the case may be, shall be
delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The
Borrower shall pay each Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
delivered by it within 10 days after its receipt of the same.

            (d) Failure on the part of any Lender to demand compensation for any
increased costs or reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in
return on capital with respect to any period shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender's right to demand compensation with respect to such period or any
other period. The protection of this Section shall be available to each Lender
regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of
the law, rule, regulation, guideline or other change or condition which shall
have occurred or been imposed.

            SECTION 2.13. Change in Legality.

            (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any change in any
law or regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the administration or interpretation thereof shall make it unlawful
for any Lender to make or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar Competitive
Loan or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with respect to
any Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar


                                       30
<PAGE>
Competitive Loan, then, by written notice to the Borrower and to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender may:

            (i) declare that Eurodollar Loans will not thereafter be made by
      such Lender hereunder, whereupon any request by the Borrower for a
      Eurodollar Committed Borrowing shall, as to such Lender only, be deemed a
      request for an ABR Loan unless such declaration shall be subsequently
      withdrawn;

            (ii) require that all outstanding Eurodollar Loans or Eurodollar
      Competitive Loans made by it be converted to ABR Loans, in which event all
      such Eurodollar Loans and Eurodollar Competitive Loans shall be
      automatically converted to ABR Loans as of the effective date of such
      notice as provided in paragraph (b) below; and

            (iii) declare that Eurodollar Competitive Loans will not thereafter
      be made by such Lender hereunder, whereupon such Lender shall not submit a
      Competitive Bid in response to a request for Eurodollar Competitive Loans
      and any obligation of such Lender relating to any Competitive Bid, whether
      or not accepted by the Borrower, shall be of no force or effect and shall
      immediately terminate.

In the event any Lender shall exercise its rights under (i) or (ii) above, all
payments and prepayments of principal which would otherwise have been applied to
repay the Eurodollar Loans that would have been made by such Lender or the
converted Eurodollar Loans or Eurodollar Competitive Loans of such Lender shall
instead be applied to repay the ABR Loans made by such Lender in lieu of, or
resulting from the conversion of, such Eurodollar Loans or Eurodollar
Competitive Loans.

            (b) For purposes of this Section 2.13, a notice to the Borrower by
any Lender shall be effective as to each Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar
Competitive Loan, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest Period currently
applicable to such Eurodollar Loan or Eurodollar Competitive Loan; in all other
cases such notice shall be effective on the date of receipt by the Borrower.

            SECTION 2.14. Indemnity. The Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of (a) any failure by the Borrower to fulfill on the date of any
borrowing hereunder the applicable conditions set forth in Article IV, (b) any
failure by the Borrower to borrow, to convert or to continue any Loan hereunder
after irrevocable notice of such borrowing or refinancing has been given
pursuant to Section 2.02(f) or Section 2.03, (c) any payment or prepayment of a
Eurodollar Loan, Eurodollar Competitive Loan or Fixed Rate Competitive Loan
required by any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise made or deemed
made on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (d) any default in payment or prepayment of the principal amount of any
Loan or any part thereof or interest accrued thereon, as and when due and
payable (at the due date thereof, whether by scheduled maturity, acceleration,
irrevocable notice of prepayment or otherwise) or (e) the occurrence of any
Default or Event of Default, including, in each


                                       31
<PAGE>
such case, any loss or reasonable expense sustained or incurred or to be
sustained or incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties
acquired to effect or maintain such Loan or any part thereof as a Eurodollar
Loan, Eurodollar Competitive Loan or Fixed Rate Competitive Loan. Such loss or
reasonable expense shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any, as
reasonably determined by such Lender, of (i) its cost of obtaining the funds for
the Loan being paid, prepaid or not borrowed (assumed, except in the case of a
Fixed Rate Competitive Loans, to be the Adjusted LIBO Rate) for the period from
the date of such payment, prepayment or failure to borrow to the last day of the
Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, the
Interest Period for such Loan which would have commenced on the date of such
failure) over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such
Lender) that would be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds so paid,
prepaid or not borrowed for such period or Interest Period, as the case may be.
A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts which such
Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            SECTION 2.15. Pro Rata Treatment. Except as required under Sections
2.13 or 2.19(a), each ABR Borrowing and Eurodollar Committed Borrowing, each
payment or prepayment of principal of any such Borrowing, each payment of
interest on Committed Loans, each payment of the Facility Fees and each
reduction of the Commitments and each conversion or continuation of any ABR
Borrowing or Eurodollar Committed Borrowing with a Borrowing of any Type (other
than a Competitive Loan), shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Commitments (or, if such Commitments shall have
expired or been terminated, in accordance with the respective principal amounts
of their outstanding Committed Loans). Each payment or prepayment of principal
and each payment of interest on any Competitive Loan shall be allocated pro rata
among the Lenders participating in such Competitive Borrowing in accordance with
the respective principal amounts of their outstanding Competitive Loans
comprising such Competitive Borrowing. Each Lender shall be required to fund its
pro rata share of any Committed Loan irrespective of whether it has participated
in a Competitive Borrowing. Each Lender agrees that in computing such Lender's
portion of any Borrowing to be made hereunder, the Administrative Agent may, in
its discretion, round each Lender's percentage of such Borrowing, computed in
accordance with Section 2.01, to the next higher or lower whole dollar amount.

            SECTION 2.16. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if it
shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
against the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section 506 of Title
11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising from, or in
lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any other means,
obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loan as a result of
which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans shall be proportionately less
than the unpaid principal portion of the Loans of any other Lender, it shall be
deemed simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value,
and shall promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a
participation in the Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Loans, and participations in Loans held by each Lender
shall be in the same proportion to the


                                       32
<PAGE>
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal
amount of its Loans prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim or other event was to the principal amount of all Loans outstanding
prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim or other event;
provided, however, that, if any such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall
be made pursuant to this Section 2.16 and the payment giving rise thereto shall
thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments shall be
rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or prices or
adjustment restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents to the
foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding an interest and
participation in a Loan deemed to have been so purchased may exercise any and
all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all
moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully as if
such Lender had made a Loan directly to the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

            SECTION 2.17. Payments.

            (a) The Borrower shall make each payment (including principal of or
interest on any Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder and under any
other Loan Document not later than 12:00 (noon), New York City time, on the date
when due in dollars to the Administrative Agent at its offices at One Chase
Manhattan Plaza, 8th Floor, New York, New York, in immediately available funds,
without defense, recoupment, set-off or counterclaim.

            (b) Whenever any payment (including principal of or interest on any
Borrowing or any Fees or other amounts) hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall become due, or otherwise would occur, on a day that is not a
Business Day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or Fees, if applicable.

            SECTION 2.18. Taxes.

            (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding taxes imposed on the net income of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender (or any transferee or assignee thereof, including a
Participant (any such entity being called a "Transferee")) and franchise taxes
imposed on the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or Transferee) by the United
States or any jurisdiction under the laws of which the Administrative Agent or
any such Lender (or Transferee) is organized or any political subdivision
thereof (all such nonexcluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If the
Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any
sum payable hereunder to the Lenders (or any Transferee) or the Administrative
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased by the amount necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section 2.18) such Lender (or Transferee) or
the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) shall receive an amount equal to
the sum it would have received had no such


                                       33
<PAGE>
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxing authority or
other Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any present or future
stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or
similar levies which arise from any payment made hereunder or from the
execution, delivery or registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").

            (c) The Borrower will indemnify each Lender (and each Transferee)
and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes paid
by such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be,
and any liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly
or legally asserted by the relevant taxing authority or other Governmental
Authority. Such indemnification shall be made within 30 days after the date any
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, makes
written demand therefor. If a Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent
shall become aware that it is entitled to receive a refund in respect of Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower pursuant to
this Section 2.18, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of the availability of
such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the
Borrower, apply for such refund at the Borrower's expense (and reasonably
cooperate with the Borrower at the Borrower's expense to obtain such refund). If
any Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent receives a refund in
respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.18, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of
such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Borrower
(or promptly upon receipt, if the Borrower has requested application for such
refund pursuant hereto), pay such refund to the Borrower (to the extent of
amounts that have been paid by the Borrower under this Section 2.18 with respect
to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender (or Transferee
of the Administrative Agent) and without interest; provided that the Borrower,
upon the request of such Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent,
agrees to return such refund (plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such
Lender (or Transferee) or the Administrative Agent in the event such Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative Agent is required to repay such refund.
Nothing contained in this paragraph (c) shall require any Lender (or Transferee)
or the Administrative Agent to make available any of its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes which it deems to be confidential).

            (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes or Other
Taxes withheld by the Borrower in respect of any payment to any Lender (or
Transferee) or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish to the
Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 10.01, the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.


                                       34
<PAGE>
            (e) Upon the written request of the Borrower, each Lender (or
Transferee) that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States shall, if legally able to do so, prior to the immediately
following due date of any payment by the Borrower hereunder, deliver to the
Borrower such certificates, documents or other evidence, as required by the Code
or Treasury Regulations issued pursuant thereto, including Internal Revenue
Service Form W8-BEN or Form W8-ECI and any other certificate or statement of
exemption required by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1441-1, 1.1441-4 or
1.1441-6(c) or any subsequent version thereof or successors thereto, properly
completed and duly executed by such Lender (or Transferee) establishing that
such payment is (i) not subject to United States Federal withholding tax under
the Code because such payment is effectively connected with the conduct by such
Lender (or Transferee) of a trade or business in the United States or (ii)
totally exempt from United States Federal withholding tax, or subject to a
reduced rate of such tax under a provision of an applicable tax treaty. Unless
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent have received forms or other documents
satisfactory to them indicating that such payments hereunder or under the Notes
are not subject to United States Federal withholding tax or are subject to such
tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall withhold taxes from such payments at the applicable
statutory rate.

            (f) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts
to any Lender (or Transferee) in respect of United States Federal withholding
tax pursuant to paragraph (a) above if the obligation to pay such additional
amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Lender (or Transferee)
to comply with the provisions of paragraph (e) above; provided, however, that
the Borrower shall be required to pay those amounts to any Lender (or
Transferee) that it was required to pay hereunder prior to the failure of such
Lender (or Transferee) to comply with the provisions of such paragraph (e).

            (g) Any Lender (or Transferee) claiming any additional amounts
payable pursuant to this Section 2.18 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent
with legal and regulatory restrictions) to file any certificate or document
requested by the Borrower or to change the jurisdiction of its applicable
lending office if the making of such a filing or change would avoid the need for
or reduce the amount of any such additional amounts which may thereafter accrue
and would not, in the sole determination of such Lender, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender (or Transferee).

            SECTION 2.19. Termination or Assignment of Commitments Under Certain
Circumstances. In the event that any Lender shall become subject to any
receivership, conservatorship or other insolvency proceeding, the Borrower shall
have the right, at its own expense, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, (a) so long as no Event of Default or Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, to terminate the Commitment of such Lender or (b) to
require such Lender to transfer and assign without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04) all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee which shall
assume such obligations; provided that (i) no such termination or assignment
shall conflict with any law, rule, regulation or order of any Governmental


                                       35
<PAGE>
Authority and (ii) the Borrower or the Eligible Assignee, as the case may be,
shall pay to the affected Lender in immediately available funds on the date of
such termination or assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date
of payment on the Loans made by it hereunder and all other amounts accrued for
its account or owed to it hereunder.

            SECTION 2.20. Increase in Commitments.

            (a) The Borrower may from time to time request an increase in the
Total Commitment by an aggregate amount not to exceed $50,000,000; provided,
that there exists no Default or Event of Default and the amount of the increase
may be incurred as "Priority Indebtedness" under the Indebtedness and other
agreements described on Schedule 6.01. The Borrower may request the increase by
(i) agreeing with one or more existing Lenders (each, an "Assuming Lender") that
such Lender's Commitment shall be increased or (ii) designating one or more
Eligible Assignees not theretofore a Lender to become a Lender (each an
"Additional Lender") by executing a Joinder Agreement, which designation shall
be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent. No Lender shall be
obligated to increase such Lender's Commitment.

            (b) If the Total Commitment is increased in accordance with this
Section, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall determine the effective
date of such increase (the "Increase Effective Date") and the final allocation
of such increase. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of the final allocation of such increase and the Increase
Effective Date. On the Increase Effective Date, the Borrower shall repay all of
the outstanding Loans (and pay any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 2.14, if any, if the Increase Effective Date is not the last day of any
Interest Period applicable to the Loans being repaid) and shall reborrow such
Loans from the Lenders, the Additional Lenders and the Assuming Lenders so that
the Percentage of each Lender, each Additional Lender and each Assuming Lender
in the Total Commitment shall be identical to its Percentage of the outstanding
Loans.

            (c) As a condition precedent to such increase, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent (i) a Compliance Certificate demonstrating
pro forma compliance with the covenants contained in Sections 5.12, 6.02, 6.04,
6.10 and 6.11 and Article VII after giving effect to such increase and (ii) a
certificate of the Borrower dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in
sufficient copies for each Lender) signed by the president, chief executive
officer or a Financial Officer of the Borrower (i) certifying and attaching the
resolutions adopted by the Borrower approving or consenting to such increase and
(ii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such increase, the
representations and warranties contained in Article III are true and correct in
all material respects on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except to the
extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier
date, in which case they shall be true and correct in all material respects as
of such earlier date, and no Default or Event of Default exists. The Borrower
shall deliver new or amended Notes reflecting the increased Commitment of any
Lender holding or requesting a Note. The Administrative Agent shall distribute
an amended Schedule 2.01 (which shall be deemed incorporated into this
Agreement), to reflect any changes therein resulting from such increase.


                                       36

            (d) This Section shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.15 or
10.08 to the contrary.

instrument contemplated thereby to which it is or will be a party and to borrow
hereunder.

            SECTION 3.02. Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance

provision of any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
property is or may be bound, (ii) be in conflict with, result in a breach of or

Borrower in accordance with its terms.

            SECTION 3.04. Governmental and Other Approvals. No action, consent
or approval of, registration or filing with or any other action by any
Governmental Authority or any third party is or will be required in connection
with the Transactions or the enforceability of the Loan Documents, to which any
Loan Party is a party, except such as have been made or obtained and are in full
force and effect.

            SECTION 3.05. Financial Statements. The Borrower has heretofore
furnished to the Lenders its consolidated and consolidating balance sheets and
statements of income and cash flows as of and for the fiscal year ended March
31, 2001, audited by and accompanied by the opinion of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, independent public accountants. Such financial statements present fairly
the financial condition and results of operations of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period. Such balance
sheets and the notes thereto disclose all material liabilities, direct or
contingent, of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the date

<PAGE>
            (b) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
in any manner under any provision of any indenture or other agreement or

            SECTION 3.15. No Material Misstatements. No information, report,
financial statement, exhibit or schedule furnished by or on behalf of the

each Plan (and each related trust, if any) which is intended to be qualified

otherwise) or prospects of the Borrower or of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

            SECTION 3.19. Priority Indebtedness. The total amount of "Priority

effect on the Closing Date, or would violate Applicable Law and (B) the

ARTICLE VI. NEGATIVE COVENANTS

            The Borrower covenants and agrees with each Lender and the
Administrative Agent that, so long as this Agreement shall remain in effect or
the principal of or interest on any Loan, any Fees or any other expenses or
amounts payable under any Loan Document shall be unpaid, unless the Required
Lenders shall otherwise consent in writing, the Borrower will not, and will not
cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

            SECTION 6.01. Limitations on Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends,
etc. Enter into or permit to exist any indenture, agreement, instrument or other
arrangement which, directly or indirectly, prohibits or restrains, or has the
effect of prohibiting or restraining, or imposes materially adverse conditions
upon, (i) the ability of any Subsidiary of the Borrower to make loans or
advances to the Borrower or to declare and pay dividends or make distributions
on shares of such Subsidiary's capital stock (whether now or hereafter
outstanding); provided, however, that any agreement to subordinate Indebtedness
owing from any Subsidiary of the Borrower to the Borrower or owing between
Subsidiaries of the Borrower to any Priority Indebtedness or to any guarantee of
such Indebtedness shall not be deemed to violate this Section 6.01 so long as
any such agreement to subordinate does not directly or indirectly prohibit or
restrain the ability of


                                       54
<PAGE>
any such Subsidiary to make loans or advances to the Borrower or to declare and
pay dividends or make distributions on shares of such Subsidiary's capital stock
(whether now or hereafter outstanding), (ii) the ability of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries to create, grant or assume any Lien upon its properties,
revenues or assets, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to secure the
Facility, or (iii) the ability of any Subsidiary of the Borrower to guaranty the
Borrower's Indebtedness, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for the
Indebtedness and other agreements described on Schedule 6.01 as in effect on the
Closing Date, the Borrower's bond indentures existing and as in effect on the
Closing Date, and any indenture, agreement, instrument or other arrangement
containing restrictions or prohibitions which are no more restrictive to the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries than the terms as set forth in the Borrower's bond
indentures existing and as in effect on the Closing Date.

            SECTION 6.02. Priority Indebtedness. Incur, create, assume or permit
to exist at any time any Indebtedness or any Sale and Leaseback Obligation,
which would result in (a) the sum, without duplication, of (i) Indebtedness of
Subsidiaries of the Borrower (excluding Indebtedness of any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Borrower to the Borrower or of any other wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Borrower to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower), (ii)
Indebtedness that is secured by Liens permitted under Section 6.03 and (iii)
Sale and Leaseback Obligations (other than Sale and Leaseback Obligations that
are not Capitalized Lease Obligations and that were entered into prior to the
date hereof), exceeding (b) 10% of Consolidated Tangible Net Assets (any such
Indebtedness permitted and existing under this Section 6.02 being herein
referred to as "Priority Indebtedness"); provided that the amount of Priority
Indebtedness available hereunder shall not be greater than the lowest amount of
"Priority Indebtedness" as defined in and as available under the documents
governing Indebtedness and the other agreements described on Schedule 6.01 and
any comparable provision in any other Indebtedness document or other agreement,
in each case, so long as such documents or agreements are applicable, if at all;
and, if all such documents or agreements are no longer outstanding, then the
limit on the amount of Priority Indebtedness set forth in this proviso shall be
eliminated; provided, further, that the Sale and Leaseback Obligations included
in clause (iii) of this Section 6.02 shall exclude up to $50,000,000 of Sale and
Leaseback Obligations entered into after the Closing Date that are not
Capitalized Lease Obligations at such time as the definitions of "Priority
Indebtedness" in all of the documents governing Indebtedness and the other
agreements described on Schedule 6.01 and any comparable provision in any other
Indebtedness document or other agreement are amended to provide for such
exclusion or all such documents and agreements are no longer applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Guaranteed Portion shall be applied
against the amount of Priority Indebtedness permitted under this Section 6.02.

            SECTION 6.03. Liens. Create, incur, assume or permit to exist any
Lien on any property or assets (including any stock or other securities of any
Person (including any Subsidiary of the Borrower)) now owned or hereafter
acquired by it or on any income or revenues or rights in respect of any thereof,
except:

Borrower and its Subsidiaries securing monetary obligations of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, which, to the extent securing Indebtedness in excess of
$1,000,000, are set forth in Schedule 6.03 and any replacement, extension or
renewal of any such Lien; provided that (x) no such replacement, extension or
renewal shall encumber any additional assets of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries and (y) the amount of Indebtedness secured by such Lien shall not
be increased from that existing on the Closing Date;

            (b) any Lien existing on any property or asset prior to the
acquisition thereof by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that
(i) such Lien is not created in contemplation of or in connection with such
acquisition and (ii) any such Lien does not by its terms cover any property or
assets after the time the Borrower directly or indirectly acquires such property
or assets which were not covered immediately prior thereto, and (iii) any such
Lien does not by its terms secure any Indebtedness other than Indebtedness
existing immediately prior to the time of acquisition of such property or
assets;

            (c) Liens for taxes not yet due or which are being contested in
compliance with Section 5.03;

            (d) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanic's, materialmen's,
repairmen's or other like Liens arising in the ordinary course of business and
securing obligations that are not yet due or which are being contested in
compliance with Section 5.03;

            (e) pledges and deposits made in the ordinary course of business in

            (f) deposits to secure the performance of bids, trade contracts
(other than for Indebtedness), leases (other than Capital Lease Obligations),

            (g) zoning restrictions, easements, rights-of-way, restrictions on
use of real property and other similar encumbrances incurred in the ordinary
course of business which, in the aggregate, are not substantial in amount and do
not materially detract from the value of the property subject thereto or
interfere with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries;

            (h) Liens granted by a Subsidiary of the Borrower in favor of the
Borrower, as long as the obligations secured by such Liens are pledged to the
Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Lenders;

            (i) purchase money security interests in real property, improvements
thereto or equipment hereafter acquired (or, in the case of improvements,
constructed) by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries; provided that (i) such
security interests secure


                                       56
<PAGE>
Indebtedness permitted by Sections 6.02 and 7.01, (ii) such security interests
are incurred, and the Indebtedness secured thereby is created, within 120 days
after such acquisition (or construction); (iii) such security interests do not
apply to any other property or assets of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries; and (iv) the Indebtedness secured by such security interests does
not exceed the lesser of the cost or fair market value of the property or assets
at the time of acquisition; and

            (j) Liens, in addition to the Liens permitted by clauses (a) through
(i) above, securing Indebtedness of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Obligations hereunder); provided that such Indebtedness is
permitted by Section 6.02.

            SECTION 6.04. Mergers, Consolidations and Sales of Assets. Merge
into or consolidate with any other Person, or permit any other Person to merge
into or consolidate with the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or liquidate,
wind up or dissolve itself (or suffer any liquidation or dissolution), or sell,

transactions) all of its assets or all or any substantial part of its Core
Assets, in each case whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or enter into any
agreement to do any of the foregoing at any future time; provided, however, that
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may consolidate or merge with any other
Person (other than a merger or consolidation of a Guarantor into the Borrower)
if (a) the Borrower or such Subsidiary shall be the surviving corporation and
(b) no Event of Default or Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur
as a result of such merger or consolidation.

            For the purposes of this Section 6.04, a sale, transfer, lease
(other than Core Assets leased pursuant to a Sale and Leaseback Transaction
consummated within 120 days of the acquisition thereof) or other disposition of
a "substantial part" of the Core Assets of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have occurred if the book value of the Core
Assets to be sold, transferred, leased or otherwise disposed of (or, in the case
of shares of capital stock of a Subsidiary of the Borrower owning Core Assets,
the greater of the book value of such shares or the proceeds realized from the
sale, transfer or other disposition of such shares) when added to the book value
(and/or proceeds realized, when applicable, in the case of shares of capital
stock of a Subsidiary of the Borrower owning Core Assets) of Core Assets sold,
transferred, leased or otherwise disposed of by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than (i) Core Assets sold, transferred, leased or disposed

<PAGE>
"Subsidiary Stock Transfer") unless (i) not less than the fair market value is

occurred and be continuing, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries may engage in any
of the foregoing transactions in the ordinary course of business at prices and

provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any
transaction between the Borrower and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries or between
any wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Borrower.

            SECTION 6.08. Business of Borrower and its Subsidiaries. Enter into

ARTICLE IX. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

            In order to expedite the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, JPMCB is hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Lenders. Each of the Lenders, and each subsequent holder of any Note by its
acceptance thereof, hereby irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on behalf of such Lender or holder and to exercise such powers
as are specifically delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms and
provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents, together with such actions
and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may
perform any of its duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors,
agents or employees. The Administrative Agent is hereby expressly authorized by
the Lenders, without hereby limiting any implied authority, (a) to receive on
behalf of the Lenders all payments of principal of and interest on the Loans and
all other amounts due to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to
each Lender its proper share of each payment so received; (b) to give prompt
notice on behalf of each of the Lenders to the Borrower of any Event of Default
specified in this Agreement of which the Administrative Agent has actual
knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; and (c) to
distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and other
materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement as received by
the Administrative Agent.

            Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents shall be liable as such for any action taken or omitted by
any of them except for its or his own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or
be responsible for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the
contents of any document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to
ascertain or to make any inquiry


                                       63
<PAGE>
concerning the performance or observance by the Borrower of any of the terms,
conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan Document. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to the Lenders or the holders of
the Notes for the due execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or
effectiveness of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Documents or other
instruments or agreements. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee
of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof until it shall have
received from the payee of such Note notice, given as provided herein, of the
transfer thereof in compliance with Section 10.04. The Administrative Agent
shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in
accordance with written instructions signed by the Required Lenders and, except
as otherwise specifically provided in Section 10.08(b) or elsewhere herein, such
instructions and any action or inaction pursuant thereto shall be binding on all
the Lenders and each subsequent holder of any Note. The Administrative Agent
shall, in the absence of knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any
instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
shall have any responsibility to the Borrower on account of the failure of or
delay in performance or breach by any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder
or to any Lender on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach
by any other Lender or the Borrower of any of their respective obligations
hereunder or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or
therewith. The Administrative Agent may execute any and all duties hereunder by
or through agents or employees and shall be entitled to rely upon (i) the advice
of legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower) with respect to all matters
arising hereunder and shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered in
good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such counsel and (ii) all
statements and communications received from the Borrower or from any other
Person, believed by it to be authentic, and shall not be liable for any action
taken or omitted in good faith on such reliance.

            The duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and
administrative in nature; the Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of
any Lender or the holder of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as
to impose upon the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document except as expressly set forth herein. The
Lenders hereby acknowledge that the Administrative Agent shall be under no duty
to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders.

            Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided below, the Administrative Agent may resign at
any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation,
the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor. If no
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative


                                       64
<PAGE>
Agent which shall be a bank with an office in the United States of America,
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500,000,000 or an Affiliate
of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent
hereunder by a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to and become vested
with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. After the Administrative Agent's
resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.05 shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

            With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder and the Notes issued
to it, the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity and not as
Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money
to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative
Agent.

            Each Lender recognizes that applicable laws, rules, regulations or
guidelines of Governmental Authorities may require the Administrative Agent to
determine whether the transactions contemplated hereby should be classified as
"highly leveraged" or assigned any similar or successor classification, and that
such determination may be binding upon the other Lenders. Each Lender
understands that any such determination shall be made solely by the
Administrative Agent based upon such factors (which may include, without
limitation, the Administrative Agent's internal policies and prevailing market
practices) as the Administrative Agent shall deem relevant and agrees that the
Administrative Agent shall have no liability for the consequences of any such
determination.

            Each Lender agrees (i) to reimburse the Administrative Agent, on
demand, in the amount of its pro rata share (based on its Commitment hereunder)
of any expenses incurred for the benefit of the Lenders by the Administrative
Agent, including counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, which shall not have been reimbursed
by the Borrower and (ii) to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent
and any of its directors, officers, employees or agents, on demand, in the
amount of such pro rata share, from and against any and all liabilities, taxes,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against it in its capacity as the Administrative
Agent or any of them in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or any action taken or omitted by it or any of them
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, to the extent the same shall
not have been reimbursed by the Borrower; provided that no Lender shall be
liable to the Administrative Agent for any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Administrative Agent or any of its directors, officers,
employees or agents. The


                                       65
<PAGE>
obligations of the Lenders under this paragraph shall survive termination of the
Agreement.

            Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

            Except for notices, reports and other documents and information
expressly required to be furnished by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (or
any of their Affiliates) that may come into the possession of the Administrative
Agent or any of its Affiliates.

            Each Lender hereby acknowledges that neither the syndication agent
nor the documentation agent has any liability hereunder other than in its
capacity as a Lender.

and each Lender and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereunder.

            SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns.

                                       67
<PAGE>
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it and the Notes held by
it, if any) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld) of:

                  (A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower
      shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender,
      an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default under clause (b), (c), (g),
      (h) or (j) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing, any other
      assignee; and

                  (B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the
      Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an Eligible
      Assignee that is a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such
      assignment or that is an Affiliate of such a Lender.

            (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
      conditions:

                  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
      Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of
      the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Type, the amount of the
      Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
      assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
      respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall
      not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the
      Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that no such consent of
      the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default under clause (b),
      (c), (g), (h) or (j) of Article VIII has occurred and is continuing;

                  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of
      a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
      under this Agreement, provided that this clause shall not be construed to
      prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
      Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Type of Commitment or
      Loan;

                  (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver
      to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with
      the Note


                                       68
<PAGE>
      or Notes subject to such assignment, if any, and a processing and
      recordation fee of $3,500; and

                  (D) the Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall
      deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

                        (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof
pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the Eligible Assignee thereunder
shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under
this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.18 and
10.05). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under
this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for
purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such
rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                        (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose
as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal
amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time
to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to
the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                        (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an Eligible Assignee, together
with the Notes or Notes subject to such assignment, if any, the Eligible
Assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the Eligible Assignee
shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such
assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent
shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained
therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this
paragraph. Upon the new Lender's request, the Borrower, at its own expense,
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, in exchange for the
surrendered Note or Notes, if any, a new Note or Notes to the order of such
assignee. Such new Note or Notes shall be dated the date of the surrendered Note
or Notes which they replace and


                                       69
<PAGE>
shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto. Canceled Notes
shall be returned to the Borrower.

            (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it and the Note held by it, if any); provided that

                  (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall
      remain unchanged,

                  (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
      parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and

                  (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
      Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
      connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
      Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
      participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right
      to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or
      waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or
      instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of
      the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described
      in the first proviso to Section 10.08(b) that affects such Participant.
      Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that
      each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.12, 2.13,
      2.14, 2.15 and 2.18 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
      acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
      Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
      entitled to the benefits of Section 10.06 as though it were a Lender,
      provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16 as though
      it were a Lender.

                        (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
greater payment under Section 2.12, 2.13 or 2.18 than the applicable Lender
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is
made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a
Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.18 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to
comply with Section 2.18(e) as though it were a Lender.

            (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement and the Notes issued to
it, if any, to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided that no such pledge or assignment of a


                                       70
<PAGE>
security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

            SECTION 10.05. Expenses; Indemnity.

            (a) The Borrower agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent and the Lead Arranger in connection with
the syndication of this Facility, the preparation, execution, delivery and
administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection
with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or
thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be
consummated) or incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection
with the enforcement or protection of their rights in connection with this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with the Loans made or
the Notes, including the fees, charges and disbursements of Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, counsel for the Administrative Agent, and, in
connection with any such amendment, modification or waiver or any such
enforcement or protection, the fees, charges and disbursements of any other
counsel for the Administrative Agent, Lead Arranger or any Lender. The Borrower
further agrees that it shall indemnify the Lenders from and hold them harmless
against any present or future stamp taxes or documentary taxes, assessments or
charges made by any Governmental Authority by reason of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Lead Arranger, each Lender and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against,
and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and related expenses, including reasonable counsel fees, charges and
disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in
any way connected with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
thereby, the performance by the parties thereto of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated thereby, (ii) the use of the proceeds of the Loans or (iii) any
claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether or not any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity
shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. The obligations
of the Borrower hereunder shall include, but not be limited to: (x) the burden
and expense of defending all claims, suits and administrative proceedings (with
counsel chosen by the Indemnitee or, if requested by such Indemnitee, by the
Borrower and reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee), even if such claims,
suits or proceedings are groundless, false or fraudulent; (y) conducting all
negotiations of any description; and (z) paying and discharging, when and as the
same become due, any and all judgments, penalties or other sums due from or
rendered against such Indemnitee. In the event that any Indemnitee shall allow
legal counsel to the Borrower to conduct or defend any action to which the
indemnification rights of this


                                       71
<PAGE>
Section could be applicable, such Indemnitee shall retain the right to
participate in and monitor the progress of any claims, suits and administrative
proceedings with counsel of such Indemnitee's own choice, and the reasonable
fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the Borrower. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby
waives, any claim against any Indemnified Party, on any theory of liability, for
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions,
any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

            (c) All amounts due under this Section 10.05 shall be due and
payable upon written demand therefor.

            SECTION 10.06. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final)
at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and
any other Loan Document, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have
made any demand under this Agreement or such other Loan Document and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

            SECTION 10.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

            SECTION 10.08. Waivers; Amendment.

            (a) No failure or delay of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in
exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances.

            (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived,
amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered


                                       72
<PAGE>
into by the Borrower and Required Lenders; provided, however, that no such
agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of, or extend the maturity of
or any scheduled principal payment date or date for the payment of any interest
on, any Loan, or waive or excuse any such payment or any part thereof, or
decrease the rate of interest on any Loan, without the prior written consent of
each Lender affected thereby, (ii) decrease or extend the date for payment of
the Facility Fees of any Lender without the prior written consent of such
Lender, (iii) increase or extend any Lender's Commitment, without the prior
written consent of such Lender, (iv) release all or substantially all of the
Collateral or release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from the
Guaranty, without the consent of all of the Lenders, or (v) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.15, the provisions of this Section, the percentages in
the definition of "Required Lenders", the second sentence of Section 10.04(a)(i)
or any other provision requiring the consent of each Lender, without in each
case the prior written consent of each Lender; provided further that no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent. Each Lender and each holder of a Note shall be bound by
any waiver, amendment or modification authorized by this Section regardless of
whether its Note shall have been marked to make reference thereto, and any
consent by any Lender or holder of a Note pursuant to this Section shall bind
any Person subsequently acquiring a Note from it, whether or not such Note shall
have been so marked.

            SECTION 10.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything
herein or in the Notes to the contrary, if at any time the applicable interest
rate, together with all fees and charges which are treated as interest under
applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), as provided for herein or in any
other document executed in connection herewith, or otherwise contracted for,
charged, received, taken or reserved by any Lender, shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by such Lender in accordance with applicable law, the rate
of interest payable on the Loans made by such Lender, together with all Charges
payable to such Lender, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate.

            SECTION 10.10. Independence of Covenants. All covenants contained in
this Agreement shall be given independent effect such that, in the event a
particular action or condition is not permitted by any of such covenants, the
fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or be otherwise within the
limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of
Default or Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

            SECTION 10.11. Change in Accounting Principles. In the event any
change in accounting principles from those used in the preparation of the
financial statements referred to in Section 3.05 hereafter occasioned by the
promulgation of rules, regulations, pronouncements and opinions by, or required
by, the Financial Accounting Standards Board or the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (or successors thereto or agencies with similar
functions) directly results in (or would with the passage of time result in) a
change in the method of calculation of financial covenants, standards or terms
found in Articles I, V and VI and as a result thereof, the Borrower is unable to
comply with its related covenants hereunder, the parties hereto agree to use
their best-


                                       73
<PAGE>
faith efforts for a period of 90 days from the date a responsible officer of the
Borrower first becomes aware of the effectiveness or proposed effectiveness of
such changes, to amend such provisions so as to reflect equitably such changes
with the desired result that (a) such provisions provide to the Lenders (in
their sole discretion) adequate protection and security consistent with that
provided by the original provisions and (b) the criteria for evaluating the
Borrower's financial condition shall be the same after such change as if such
change had not been made. In the event that a responsible officer of the
Borrower does not become aware of such changes prior to their effectiveness, and
such changes directly result in an event which would, pursuant to Article VII,
constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder, during such 90-day period
(so long as the Borrower continues to use its best faith efforts to amend such
provision), such default shall not constitute or be deemed a Default or Event of
Default hereunder and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender may
commence any remedial action against the Borrower based thereon (which
restriction shall not apply to any other defaults which constitute Events of
Default); provided, however, that if the Borrower and the Required Lenders have
not reached agreement on appropriate modifications to such provisions by the
earlier of (i) the date upon which the Borrower ceases using its best faith
efforts to reflect appropriate changes and (ii) the expiration of such 90-day
period, any and all limitations contained in this Section 10.11 shall
immediately expire and be of no further force or effect.

            SECTION 10.12. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and the agreements referred to in Section 2.06(b) constitute the
entire contract between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. Any
previous agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
(other than the agreements referred to in Section 2.06(b)) is superseded by this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Nothing in this Agreement or in the
other Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party
other than the parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

            SECTION 10.13. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 10.13.


                                       74
<PAGE>
            SECTION 10.14. Severability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document should be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality
and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and therein
shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby. The parties shall endeavor
in good-faith negotiations to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as
possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.

            SECTION 10.15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two
or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original but all of
which when taken together shall constitute but one contract, and shall become
effective as provided in Section 10.03.

            SECTION 10.16. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table
of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of
this Agreement and are not to affect the construction of, or to be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

            SECTION 10.17. Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

            (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State
court or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City,
and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or,
to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any
right that any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents against the Borrower or
its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

            (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this agreement or the other Loan
Documents in any New York State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court.

            (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably designates, appoints and
empowers the Consent Agent, as its designee, appointee and agent to receive,
accept and acknowledge for and on its behalf, and in respect of its properties,
service of any and all


                                       75
<PAGE>
legal process, summons, notices and documents which may be served in any such
action or proceeding. If for any reason the Consent Agent shall cease to be
available to act as such, the Borrower agrees to designate a new Consent Agent
in New York City on the terms and for the purposes of this provision
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower further irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section
10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

Lenders have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective
authorized officers as of the day and year first above written.

                                                                    Reno, Nevada

            FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, AMERCO, a Nevada corporation
(the "Borrower"), hereby promises to pay to the order of ______________ (the
"Lender"), in lawful money of the United States of America in immediately
available funds, at the office of JPMorgan Chase Bank (the "Administrative
Agent") located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017, (i) on each
Interest Payment Date (as defined in the 3-Year Credit Agreement, dated as of
June 28, 2002, among the Borrower, the financial institutions parties thereto
and the Administrative Agent (as amended, modified, supplemented, extended or
restated from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"), the terms defined therein
being used herein as therein defined), _____________ Dollars ($________) or, if
less, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans made to the Borrower by
the Lender pursuant to the Credit Agreement to which such Interest Period
applies and (ii) on the Maturity Date, the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
all Loans made to the Borrower by the Lender pursuant to the Credit Agreement,
and to pay interest from the date hereof on the principal amount hereof from
time to time outstanding, in like funds, at said office at the rate or rates per
annum and payable on the dates provided in the Credit Agreement.

            The Borrower promises to pay interest, on demand, on any overdue
principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue interest from their due
dates at the rate or rates and at the times provided in the Credit Agreement.

            This Note is one of the Notes referred to in the Credit Agreement
and is entitled to the benefits thereof. As provided in the Credit Agreement,
this Note is subject to voluntary and mandatory prepayment, in whole or in part.

            In case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing the
principal of and accrued interest on this Note shall become or may be declared
to be due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Credit
Agreement.

            The Borrower hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand, protest
and notice of any kind whatsoever. The nonexercise by the holder of any of its
rights hereunder in any particular instance shall not constitute a waiver
thereof in that or any subsequent instance.
