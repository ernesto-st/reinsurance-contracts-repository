separately classified in any Plan of Reorganization proposed, confirmed, or adopted in an Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, if it is held that the
claims of the Senior Secured Parties and the Junior Secured Parties in respect of the Shared Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of senior and junior secured claims), then each Junior Representative, for itself
and on behalf of each Junior Secured Party under its Junior Debt Facility, hereby acknowledges and agrees that all distributions from the Shared Collateral shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against
