                                 FINANCING PLAN

     2.01 Senior Facility Lenders' Commitment to Lend.

     (a) On the date hereof, JBIC shall enter into the JBIC Loan Agreement with
the Borrower (the "JBIC Loan Agreement"), KfW shall enter into the KfW Loan
Agreement with the Borrower (the "KfW Loan Agreement") and the Commercial Banks
shall enter into the Commercial Banks Loan Agreement with the Borrower (the
"Commercial Banks Loan Agreement"), in the forms attached respectively as

Facility Loan Agreement shall reflect, among other terms, the commitment of each
Senior Facility Lender that is a party thereto to make from time to time
advances (each an "Advance") to the Borrower in an amount up to its Aggregate
Committed Amount and shall reflect the Borrower's agreement to repay such
Advances with interest.

     (b) The obligations of each Senior Facility Lender and of the Borrower with
respect to the making and the repayment of such Advances shall be as set forth
in the Senior Facility Loan Agreement to which such Senior Facility Lender is a
party and in this Agreement.

     2.02 Issuance of the Peruvian Bonds.

     (a) The Senior Facility Lenders acknowledge and agree that after the date
hereof, the Borrower shall have the right to issue bonds (the "Peruvian Bonds")
through a program (the "Peruvian Bonds Program") performed under (i) an
indenture substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D (or with such changes
(x) as may be requested by CONASEV during its review of the Peruvian Bonds
Program so long as such changes (i) are not material changes to the financial
terms of the Peruvian Bonds and (ii) are not changes that materially improve the
rights of the Peruvian Bondholders or impose materially greater obligations on
the Borrower for the benefit of the Peruvian Bondholders except if Borrower
gives equivalent rights to the Senior Facility Lenders or (y) that are notified
in writing by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent so long as the
Administrative Agent acting upon instructions from the Majority Facility Lenders
does not object in writing to such form within 15 Business Days of receipt of
such notice) (the "Peruvian Bonds Indenture") and (ii) supplementary indentures
to be entered into in connection with each specific issue of Peruvian Bonds
under the Peruvian Bonds Program. The Borrower may issue the Peruvian Bonds with
such rate of interest as may be determined by the Borrower in its sole
discretion and with an


                                        5

<PAGE>

aggregate principal amount which, shall not exceed (a) the sum of (i) U.S.$100
million and (ii) the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on the Stand-By
Advances of the Commercial Banks to be prepaid with the proceeds of such
issuance, if any, or (b) such greater amount as may be notified in writing by
the Borrower to the Administrative Agent, so long as the Administrative Agent,
acting upon instructions from each Senior Facility Lender, does not object in
writing to such amount within 15 Business Days of receipt of such notice (the
greater of (a) and (b), the "Peruvian Bonds Cap"), provided that (x) principal
and interest shall be paid on the Peruvian Bonds on the same dates as principal
and interest shall be paid on the Senior Facility Loans, (y) the Peruvian Bonds
shall mature no earlier than the Final Maturity Date and (if amortizing) shall
amortize at a rate no faster than the Senior Facility Lenders and (z) the
interest rate payable on the Peruvian Bonds shall not exceed, in the case of a
floating rate issuance, LIBOR plus 3% p.a., or in the case of a fixed rate
issuance, a fixed rate equal to LIBOR plus 3% p.a. at the time of issuance. The
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent no less than five Business Days'
advance written notice of the anticipated date of the closing of the issuance of
the Peruvian Bonds (each, a "Bond Issuance Notice").

     (b) On the date of the closing of the first issuance of Peruvian Bonds by
the Borrower (the "Bonds Closing Date"):

          (i) the Common Representative shall become a party to the Completion
     Guarantee by entering into, in its capacity as Common Representative, a New
     Party Accession Agreement (substantially in the form of Exhibit G) and
     thereupon the Peruvian Bondholders, acting through the Common
     Representative, shall collectively have all of the rights and obligations
     of a Senior Lender; and

          (ii) the Common Representative shall become a party to the Master
     Security Agreement by entering into, in its capacity as Common
     Representative, a New Party Accession Agreement and thereupon the Common
     Representative and the Peruvian Bondholders shall have all the rights and
     obligations of, respectively, the Common Representative and the Peruvian
     Bondholders under the Master Security Agreement.

     (c) On each date of issuance of Peruvian Bonds by the Borrower under the
Peruvian Bonds Program (including the Bonds Closing Date):

          (i) the Stand-By Committed Amount of the Commercial Banks will be
     automatically reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to the
     difference between (x) the principal amount of Peruvian Bonds issued on
     such date (with the aggregate reduction to be allocated to each Commercial
     Bank's Stand-By Committed Amount based on their respective Stand-By
     Committed Amounts) and (y) the proceeds of such issuance used to pay
     accrued and unpaid


                                        6

<PAGE>

     interest on the Stand-By Advances of the Commercial Banks prepaid with the
     proceeds of such issuance, if any;

          (ii) the Borrower shall instruct the placement agent to, and the
     placement agent shall, deposit to the Proceeds Account the proceeds of the
     issuance of the Peruvian Bonds on the date of issuance or immediately
     thereafter; and

          (iii) the Borrower and the Common Representative shall take all other
     actions required to be taken on such date pursuant to the documents related
     to the issuance of such Peruvian Bonds.

     (d) Subject to the provisions of this Section 2.02, the Borrower shall have
the right to issue the Peruvian Bonds as and when the Borrower deems
appropriate.

     2.03 Termination or Reduction of Commitments.

     (a) The Borrower shall have the right, upon not less than 15 Business Days'
notice to the Administrative Agent, (i) to terminate entirely all of the
Commitments or (ii) from time to time to reduce the Aggregate Committed Amount
of each of the Senior Facility Lenders, so long as the Completion Guarantee
remains in full force and effect and there is no material breach thereunder
which has occurred and is Continuing. Any such reduction shall (x) reduce
permanently the Aggregate Committed Amount of each of the Senior Facility
Lenders and (y) be required to be made pro rata among the Senior Facility
Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages. The Borrower
shall have the right, at its discretion, to allocate the reduction to the
Aggregate Committed Amount of the Commercial Banks between their respective Base
Committed Amounts and Stand-By Committed Amounts, provided that the same
allocation shall be made for each Commercial Bank. Upon any such reduction in
the Aggregate Committed Amount of the Senior Facility Lenders, the Borrower
shall promptly provide to the Senior Facility Lenders a funding plan which shall
show in the Borrower's good faith judgment that it has sufficient resources to
pay for the remainder of construction costs for the Sulfide Project, provided,
that such funding plan shall be provided for informational purposes only and
shall not bind, constitute a condition precedent, or otherwise limit the
Borrower's discretion to terminate the Commitments or reduce the Aggregate
Committed Amount of the Senior Facility Lenders in any way.

     (b) On the Availability Period End Date, the Commitment of the Senior
Facility Lenders shall terminate and thereafter no Senior Facility Lender shall
be required to make any further Advances.

     2.04 Timing of Advances.

     (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein and in
each Senior Facility Loan Agreement, the Borrower shall have the right to
request Advances from the Senior Facility Lenders in accordance with the
Drawdown Schedule attached as Schedule C, provided that the Borrower may change
actual timing of utilization without consent from the Senior Facility Lenders so
long as in each Notice of Borrowing the Borrower certifies that it expects to
use the proceeds from the disbursements to fund Project Costs expected to become
due and payable within the next 90 days and provided further that:

          (i) the Borrower shall first request Advances (a "Base Advance") from
     the Senior Facility Lenders on a Pro Rata Basis up to their respective Base
     Committed Amounts; and

          (ii) after the Senior Facility Lenders have made Base Advances in an
     amount equal to their respective Base Committed Amount, the Borrower may
     request any subsequent Advances (a "Stand-By Advance") from the Commercial
     Banks up to their respective Stand-By Committed Amount (as may be reduced
     in accordance with Section 2.03(a)).

     (b) The failure of one or more Senior Facility Lenders to disburse the
proceeds of a Senior Facility Loan on a Disbursement Date upon receipt of a
Notice of Borrowing properly given and for which no Senior Facility Lender
Negative CP Notice exists and has not been withdrawn pursuant to a Senior
Facility Lender Withdrawal Notice shall not excuse any other Senior Facility
Lenders from its own obligation to disburse the proceeds of a Senior Facility
Loan on such Disbursement Date.

     2.05 Base Advances Specific Disbursement Mechanics.

     (a) Each request for a Base Advance shall be made concurrently under each
of the Senior Facility Loan Agreements and on a Pro Rata Basis with respect to
each of the Senior Facility Lenders by delivery by the Borrower of concurrent
Notices of Borrowing (i) in the case of an Advance under the JBIC Loan
Agreement, to JBIC and the JBIC Agent, with a copy thereof to the Administrative
Agent, (ii) in the case of an Advance under the KfW Loan Agreement, to KfW, with
a copy thereof to the Administrative Agent and (iii) in the case of an Advance
under the Commercial Banks Loan Agreement, to the Administrative Agent. The
Notices of Borrowing delivered as contemplated above shall direct that the
proceeds of each Base Advance be deposited into the Onshore Dollars Account, in
accordance with the Master Security Agreement. Each such Notice of Borrowing
shall be delivered at least fifteen (15) Business Days before the proposed
Disbursement Date, which Disbursement Date shall be a Business Day; provided
that, except in the event that any Notice of Borrowing delivered in any calendar
month is deemed cancelled pursuant to Section 2.05(b), the Borrower shall not


                                        8

<PAGE>

deliver more than one Notice of Borrowing in respect of each Senior Facility
Loan in any calendar month.

     (b) In connection with the delivery of any Notice of Borrowing with respect
to a Base Advance, if JBIC, KfW or any Commercial Bank determines that any
condition precedent to such Senior Facility Lender's obligation to make an
Advance set forth in Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, will not be
satisfied or waived, the JBIC Agent on behalf of JBIC or the Administrative
Agent on behalf of KfW and the Commercial Banks (as the case may be) shall
notify the Borrower and each other Senior Facility Lender no later than six (6)
Business Days prior to the Disbursement Date requested by the Borrower in such
Notice of Borrowing of such determination in a notice identifying with
particularity the condition(s) not satisfied or waived (a "Senior Facility
Lender Negative CP Notice"), in which case all such Notices of Borrowing shall
be deemed canceled for all purposes of this Agreement. The failure of the JBIC
Agent on behalf of JBIC or the Administrative Agent on behalf of KfW and the
Commercial Banks to provide such notice shall not waive any right of such Senior
Facility Lender not to make an Advance on the Disbursement Date requested by the
Borrower if any such condition precedent has not been satisfied or waived as of
such date. Notwithstanding anything else herein, neither the JBIC Agent on
behalf of JBIC nor the Administrative Agent on behalf of any Senior Facility
Lender shall have the right to deliver a Senior Facility Lender Negative CP
Notice with respect to a Base Advance (other than the initial Base Advance), (i)
in the case of a failure to satisfy any conditions precedent set forth in
Section 5.01(q) subclauses (ii) and (iii), Section 5.01(r) and Section 5.01(s),
unless the failure to satisfy such condition precedent has been approved by
Senior Facility Lenders pursuant to a Supermajority Facility Vote and (ii) in
the case of a failure to satisfy any other conditions precedent to subsequent
Base Advance, if such condition has been waived by the Administrative Agent
acting pursuant to instructions from each Senior Facility Lender.

     (c) Upon delivery of a Senior Facility Lender Negative CP Notice, the
Senior Facility Lenders shall have no obligation to make the Advance requested
in the applicable Notice of Borrowing; provided, however, that the Senior
Facility Lenders' obligation to make the requested Advance shall be reinstated
if the JBIC Agent (in the case of a Senior Facility Lender Negative CP Notice
delivered by the JBIC Agent) or the Administrative Agent (in the case of a
Senior Facility Lender Negative CP Notice delivered by the Administrative Agent)
informs the JBIC Agent on behalf of JBIC, the Administrative Agent, the Borrower
and each other Senior Facility Lender in writing that each condition precedent
identified in the applicable Senior Facility Lender Negative CP Notice has
either been satisfied or waived (a "Senior Facility Lender Withdrawal Notice").
Upon the receipt of a Senior Facility Lender Withdrawal Notice, the Borrower may
re-deliver the Notices of Borrowing dated the date such Notices are redelivered,
in which it shall propose the new requested Disbursement Date for the Advance
requested in such Notice of Borrowing; provided, that such new requested


                                        9

<PAGE>

Disbursement Date shall be no earlier than six (6) Business Days after receipt
by the parties referred to above of such Senior Facility Lender Withdrawal
Notice, and provided, further, that the issuance of any Senior Facility Lender
Withdrawal Notice, shall not waive any right of any Senior Facility Lender not
to make an Advance on such requested Disbursement Date if any condition
precedent has not been satisfied or waived as of such date.

     (d) Subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing and of the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 5.01 or 5.02, as the case may be, on the relevant
Disbursement Date, no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on each
requested Disbursement Date for a Base Advance, the JBIC Agent shall transfer
the proceeds of the Senior Facility Loans to be provided under the JBIC Loan
Agreement, KfW shall transfer the proceeds of the Senior Facility Loans to be
provided by KfW and the Administrative Agent shall transfer the proceeds of the
Senior Facility Loans to be provided by the Commercial Banks, in each case, to
the Borrower for deposit in the Onshore Dollars Account.

     2.06 Stand-By Advances Specific Disbursement Mechanics.

     (a) Each request for a Stand-By Advance shall be made under the Commercial
Banks Loan Agreement and on a Pro Rata Basis with respect to each of the
Commercial Banks by delivery by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing to the
Administrative Agent. The Notices of Borrowing delivered as contemplated above
shall direct that the proceeds of each Stand-By Advance be deposited into the
Onshore Dollars Account, in accordance with the Master Security Agreement. Each
such Notice of Borrowing shall be delivered at least 10 New York Business Days
before the relevant Disbursement Date, which Disbursement Date shall be a New
York Business Day.

     (b) Subject to the satisfaction of the foregoing and of the conditions
precedent set forth in Section 5.02 on the relevant Disbursement Date, no later
than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on each requested Disbursement Date for a
Stand-By Advance, the Administrative Agent shall transfer the proceeds of the
Senior Facility Loans to be provided by the Commercial Banks to the Borrower for
deposit in the Onshore Dollars Account.

     2.07 Several Obligations. The obligations of each Senior Facility Lender
hereunder shall be several not joint. No Senior Facility Lender shall have any
obligation to any MPA Party for the failure by any other Senior Lender to make
any Senior Loans required to be made by such Senior Lender or to comply with any
other obligation of such Senior Lender hereunder or under any other Financing
Document to which it is a party.


                                       10

<PAGE>

     2.08 Promissory Notes.

     (a) On each Disbursement Date (including on the Closing Date), the Borrower
shall deliver to each Senior Facility Lender duly executed promissory notes
(pagares) (each, a "Promissory Note") in Spanish together with an English
translation thereof, substantially in the forms attached to the respective
Senior Facility Loan Agreement, issued in favor of, respectively, each Senior
Facility Lender making an Advance on such date, with blanks appropriately
completed in conformity herewith and the respective Senior Facility Loan
Agreement, which shall (i) be payable to the order of such Senior Facility
Lender, (ii) be in the principal amount equal to the Advance made by such Senior
Facility Lender on such Disbursement Date, (iii) be payable in installments and
mature on the Final Maturity Date, (iv) bear interest as provided in Section
3.02, and (v) be dated on such Disbursement Date.

     (b) On the first Payment Date following the Completion Release Date, the
Borrower shall (i) cancel all Promissory Notes previously issued to a given
Senior Facility Lender and (ii) replace such Promissory Notes by a single
Promissory Note which shall be (x) issued for a principal amount equal to the
aggregate amount of all Advances made by such Senior Facility Lender minus all
principal repayments made to such Senior Facility Lender up to (and including)
the date of replacement and (y) issued on identical terms and conditions as the
Promissory Notes being replaced by such single Promissory Note except that (1)
in the case of the Promissory Notes issued in favor of the Commercial Banks, the
Margin shall be adjusted to reflect the Margin (as defined in the Commercial
Banks Loan Agreement) applicable in the periods following the Completion Release
Date and (2) in the case of the Promissory Notes issued in favor of JBIC, the
interest (as described in Section 5.01 of the JBIC Loan Agreement) shall be
adjusted to reflect the interest applicable in the period following the
Completion Release Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Senior
Facility Lender that is a Commercial Bank, one Promissory Note shall be issued
for its Base Advances and one separate Promissory Note shall be issued for its
Stand-By Advances and in the case of JBIC, one Promissory Note shall be issued
for its Tranche A Advances and one separate Promissory Note shall be issued for
its Tranche B Advances. Borrower shall also cancel and replace the Promissory
Notes issued to KfW in connection with an exercise by Borrower of its right to
convert Floating Rate Loans into Fixed Rate Loans as such terms are defined in
the KfW Loan Agreement.

     (c) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Promissory Notes
described above shall not affect in any way whatsoever the rights or obligations
of the Borrower under this Agreement, and the rights and claims of the Senior
Facility Lenders under the Promissory Notes shall not replace or supersede the
rights and claims of the Senior Facility Lenders hereunder, provided that
payment of any part of principal of any Promissory Note shall, to the extent
that such payment if made hereunder would discharge Senior Facility Loans
Obligations in respect of the payment of principal of the


                                       11

<PAGE>

Senior Facility Loan evidenced by such Promissory Note, discharge such
obligation pro tanto, and the payment of any principal of a Senior Facility Loan
in accordance with the terms hereof shall discharge the obligations of the
Borrower under the Promissory Note evidencing such Senior Facility Loan pro
tanto.

     (d) Upon an assignment by a Senior Facility Lender of any of its interest
hereunder as permitted under Section 12.13, the Promissory Note of the assignor
may be cancelled, in which case the Borrower shall, upon the written request of
the assignor, issue new Promissory Notes to the assignor (to the extent the
assignor continues to maintain certain interest hereunder after such assignment)
and the assignee.

     (e) Upon discharge of all Senior Facility Loans Obligations under this
Agreement, each Senior Facility Lender shall cancel and return each Promissory
Note to the Borrower.

     (f) The Promissory Notes shall be non negotiable but may be transferred by
assignment together with the assignment of an Advance that is permitted in
accordance with Section 12.13(c) hereof.

     2.09 Senior Facility Lender's Failure to Fund.

     (a) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by any Senior
Facility Lender (each, a "Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to
make payment pursuant to Section 2.05(d) to the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent of the proceeds of an Advance to be made by such Payor hereunder (such
payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice shall be
effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the Required
Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption
(but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the
Borrower.

     (b) If the Payor has not in fact made the Required Payment to the
Administrative Agent, then (without limiting the claim any Person may have on
account of non-receipt of the Required Payment), the Payor shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate
equal to the daily average cost of funding of the Administrative Agent for the
period from and including the date on which the Required Payment was required to
be made to the date the Payor makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent.

     (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Senior Facility
Lender and the Borrower of any receipt of notice by the Administrative Agent
from a Senior Facility Lender that such Senior Facility Lender does not intend
to make payment to the Administrative Agent of the proceeds of an Advance.

          (i) Subject to paragraph (f) below, if the proceeds so received are in

     shall within 60 days after receipt of such proceeds apply the proceeds so
     received to prepay the Outstanding Advance Amounts of the Senior Facility
     Lenders, unless the Borrower (x) intends to use such proceeds for the
     repair, reconstruction or replacement of the lost or damaged property, or
     to replenish the Proceeds Account to the extent of any such repair,
     reconstruction or replacement expenses actually paid with funds credited to
     the Proceeds Account and (y) notifies to the Administrative Agent in

     Borrower's plan and the Outstanding Advance Amount and the ability to pay
     the Senior Facility Loans Obligations as and when they become due),
     provided that such approval shall be deemed given in the absence of a

<PAGE>

          (i) Subject to paragraph (f) below, if the proceeds so received are in
     excess of US$10 million but below US$100 million, except if such proceeds

     within 60 days after receipt of such proceeds apply the proceeds so
     received to prepay the Outstanding Advance Amounts of the Senior Facility
     Lenders, unless the Borrower (x) intends to use such proceeds for the
     replacement of the expropriated property or to replenish the Proceeds
     Account to the extent of any replacement expenses actually paid with funds
     credited to the Proceeds Account and (y) notifies to the Administrative
     Agent in writing within 30 days after receipt of such proceeds its plans
     for the replacement of the expropriated property or the status of
     implementation of such plans if already started; and

          (ii) If the proceeds so received are in excess of US$100 million or in
     excess of US$10 million but relate to an expropriation of Non-Replaceable
     Property, the Borrower shall within 60 days after receipt of such proceeds
     apply the proceeds so received to prepay the Outstanding Advance Amounts of
     the Senior Facility Lenders, unless the Borrower submits a plan for the use
     of such proceeds to the Administrative Agent and the Independent Engineer
     within 30 days of receipt and such plan is approved by the Administrative
     Agent (acting upon instructions from the Majority Facility Lenders, taking
     into consideration the nature of the loss, the reasonableness of the
     Borrower's plan and the Outstanding Advance Amount and the ability to pay
     the Senior Facility Loans Obligations as and when they become due),
     provided that such approval shall be deemed given in the absence of a
     response from the Administrative Agent within 30 days from receipt of the
     Borrower's request for approval.

     (d) If 90 days after the making of the Advance made on or immediately prior
to the Availability Period End Date, proceeds thereof have not been fully
applied to the payment of Project Costs, the Borrower shall, within 30 days,
apply such remaining proceeds to prepay the Outstanding Advance Amounts of the
Senior Facility Lenders.

     (e) The Borrower may also be required to prepay the Outstanding Advance
Amounts of one or several Senior Facility Lenders as and when contemplated in
Section 3.12.

     (f) During the Continuance of a Borrower Event of Default, but prior to
delivery of an Enforcement Direction, the application of the proceeds in clauses
(b)(i) and (c)(i) of this Section 3.06 shall be subject to the delivery by the
Borrower, and approval by the Administrative Agent, of a plan for the use of
such proceeds as provided in clauses (b)(ii) and (c)(ii), as applicable, of this
Section 3.06; provided, however, that upon delivery of a Borrower Enforcement
Direction the direction contained therein shall apply.

     (g) On the Debt Buy-Down Closing Date, the Borrower shall prepay the
Outstanding Advance Amounts of the Senior Facility Lenders in an amount equal to
the

<PAGE>

difference between the Retired Principal Senior Loan Amount and the aggregate
portion of the Purchased Principal Senior Loan Amount purchased and paid for by
all Parent Companies.

     3.07 Partial Payments. If at any time at which any Senior Loans Obligations
are payable to a Senior Facility Lender such Senior Facility Lender receives
insufficient funds to pay in full all Senior Loans Obligations payable to such
Senior Facility Lender at such time pursuant to its Senior Loan Document or the
other Financing Documents, the funds so received by such Senior Facility Lender
at such time shall be deemed to be applied in order of priority for purposes of
computations hereunder and under the Senior Loan Document and the other
Financing Documents, as follows: first, to fees, commissions, indemnities,
expenses and all amounts (other than principal of and interest on the Senior
Loans) payable to such Senior Facility Lender; second, to interest (including
post-default interest) on the Senior Loans held by such Senior Facility Lender;
and third, to principal of the Senior Loans held by such Senior Facility Lender,
applied to reduce each outstanding principal installment ratably; provided that
if a Senior Loans Obligation has been accelerated, funds may be applied in any
order of priority as any Senior Facility Lenders holding such accelerated Senior
Loans Obligation may determine.

     3.08 Application of Prepayments Other Than Prepayments in Full. Each
prepayment of principal made to a Senior Facility Lender on account of Senior
Loans shall (unless such prepayment repays in full the Senior Loans held by such
Senior Facility Lender) be applied to prepay each outstanding installment of
principal of Senior Loans under such Senior Facility Lender's Senior Loan
Document ratably.

     3.09 Taxes.

     (a) Any and all payments made by or on account of the Borrower to a Senior
Facility Lender in respect of any obligation hereunder or under the Financing
Documents (including, without limitation, all payments of principal, interest,
premium and fees) shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for or on account of, any and all present or future Taxes (excluding
(i) Taxes imposed on or measured by the net income, profits, or capital of a
Senior Facility Lender by the jurisdiction under the laws of which such Senior
Facility Lender was incorporated or organized, (ii) Taxes which would not have
been imposed on a Senior Facility Lender but for a change by such Senior
Facility Lender of its lending office, (iii) Taxes which would not have been
imposed on a Senior Facility Lender but for the transfer by such Senior Facility
Lender of an interest in its Advances or (iv) Taxes which would not have been
imposed on a Senior Facility Lender but for such Senior Facility Lender's having
a place of business in the jurisdiction imposing the Tax (other than a place of
business arising from the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents
or from having executed, delivered, performed its obligations or received a
payment under, or enforced any of the Financing Documents)), Taxes described in
the immediately preceding


                                       17

<PAGE>

clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to herein as the "Excluded Taxes" and
Taxes, other than the Excluded Taxes being referred to herein as "Indemnified
Taxes", now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority of Peru, unless such deduction or withholding is required
by applicable Government Rule, in which case paragraph (b) below shall apply.

     (b) If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Indemnified
Taxes now or hereafter imposed, levied or collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority of Peru from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder
or under the Senior Facility Loan Agreements, the Borrower shall, at its option,
either (i) pay to the Senior Facility Lender in respect of which such deduction
or withholding is required to be made, such additional amount (the "Additional
Tax Amount") as may be necessary so that after all required deductions and
withholdings (including, without limitation, deductions and withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.09(b)), such Senior
Facility Lender receives on the due date thereof an amount equal to the sum it
would have received, had no such deduction or withholding been made, or (ii)
assume the payment of the Indemnified Tax and pay directly the full amount to
the tax administration when due in accordance with Article 47 of the Peruvian
Income Tax Act, so that the amount paid to the Senior Facility Lender equals the
amount it would have received if the Borrower had not been required by law to
deduct such Indemnified Tax.

     (c) The Borrower shall pay any and all present or future stamp duty,
documentary, registration, excise, recording, notary, value added or similar
Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority by reason of the preparation,
execution, issuance, delivery, registration, notarization, filing, recording,
amendment, supplement, waiver, modification, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement or any other Financing Document ("Other Taxes").

     (d) Without duplication of Section 12.21(c), the Borrower will indemnify
the Administrative Agent and each Senior Facility Lender against, and reimburse
the Administrative Agent and each Lender on demand for, any Indemnified Taxes
paid directly by the recipient of the payment with respect to which such
Indemnified Tax is levied in circumstances where the Borrower has failed to
comply with its obligation to pay Additional Tax Amount as contemplated in
Section 3.09(b) and any loss, liability, claim or expense, including interest,
penalties, judgments, costs or disbursements and reasonable and documented legal
fees, which the Administrative Agent or any Senior Facility Lender may incur at
any time arising out of or in connection with any failure of the Borrower to
make any payment of such Indemnified Taxes when due.

     (e) Each Senior Facility Lender shall, from time to time, following receipt
of a written request therefor by the Borrower, furnish to the Borrower any form
or certificate and other assistance reasonably requested that may be necessary
to establish


                                       18

<PAGE>

any available exemption from, or reduction in the amount of, Indemnified Taxes,
including:

          (i) A certification as to the fact that such Senior Facility Lender is
     "unrelated" to the Borrower, in the form set forth in Schedule E, and any
     other certification as may be necessary under Peruvian law to qualify for
     the reduced rate of withholding tax; and

          (ii) In the case of Senior Loans from JBIC and KfW and at the cost of
     the Borrower, affidavits or certifications issued by Authorized Officers of
     JBIC and KfW (and duly certified by a Public Notary in the jurisdiction
     where they are issued and by a Peruvian consul) confirming the matters set
     forth in Schedule F.

     (f) The Borrower shall provide to the Senior Facility Lenders receipt or
other evidence of payment received by the Borrower from the applicable
Governmental Authority of Peru in connection with the payment by Borrower of any
Indemnified Tax required to be withheld or assessed in respect of any sum
payable hereunder or under the Senior Facility Loan Agreements.

     (g) The agreements in this Section 3.09 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

     3.10 Single Senior Lender Suspension or Termination.

     (a) If JBIC or KfW shall have suspended, cancelled or terminated its
Commitment (a "Suspending Lender"), in whole or in part, in accordance with the
terms of Section 10.02 of the JBIC Loan Agreement or Section 12.03 of the KfW
Loan Agreement, as the case may be, by a notice delivered to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent, each other Senior Facility Lender shall be entitled to
suspend its obligation to make additional Advances, provided that (i) such
suspension shall terminate (and each Senior Facility Lender shall no longer be
entitled to suspend its obligation to make additional Advances solely by reason
of such suspension) if the Suspending Lender rescinds the actions described in
such notice or if a Replacement Loan Agreement is entered into for the entire
amount of the Suspending Lender's undrawn Base Committed Amount and (ii) such
suspension shall not be effective with respect to a given requested Advance (and
each Senior Facility Lender shall no longer be entitled to suspend its
obligation to make a given requested Advance solely by reason of such
suspension) if a Bridge Loan Agreement is entered into for an amount at least
equal to the Suspending Lender's pro rata share of such requested Advance.

     (b) During a period of 180 days following the date on which the Suspending
Lender shall have first given to the Borrower notice of such suspension,
cancellation, or termination:


                                       19

<PAGE>

          (i) The Borrower shall have the right to enter into a Replacement Loan
     Agreement with one or several of the Parent Companies or their Affiliates
     or any third parties (which third party shall be an Investment Grade
     Entity) (a "Replacement Lender"), which shall enter into a New Party
     Accession Agreement to become a party, as a Senior Facility Lender, to this
     Agreement, the Completion Guarantee, the Master Security Agreement and the
     Transfer Restrictions Agreement, pursuant to which such Replacement Lender
     shall undertake to make Advances to the Borrower in an amount equal to the
     undrawn portion of the Suspending Lender's Base Committed Amount.

          (ii) The Borrower shall have the right to request the Suspending
     Lender in writing to, and within 10 days of receipt of such written request
     the Suspending Lender shall (subject, if KfW is the Suspending Lender, to
     receipt of any necessary German Governmental Approvals), assign all Base
     Advances made by the Suspending Lender to the Replacement Lender for an
     amount (payable in cash at the closing of such assignment) equal to the
     Suspending Lender's Outstanding Base Amount plus accrued and unpaid
     interest to the date of the closing of such assignment.

          (iii) The Borrower shall have the right to enter into a Bridge Loan
     Agreement with one or several of the Parent Companies or their Affiliates
     or any third parties (which third party shall be an Investment Grade
     Entity) (a "Bridge Loan Provider"). The provider of such bridge loan shall
     enter into a New Party Accession Agreement to become a party, as a Senior
     Facility Lender, to this Agreement, the Completion Guarantee, the Master
     Security Agreement and the Transfer Restrictions Agreement. Such Bridge
     Loan Agreement may (without any consent from the Senior Facility Lenders)
     (x) subsequently be assigned to a Replacement Lender or to the Suspending
     Lender or (y) subsequently be prepaid (regardless as to whether or not
     other Senior Facility Loans are also prepaid) out of the proceeds of a
     Replacement Loan Agreement.

     (c) If, by the end such 180-day period, (i) the Suspending Lender shall not
have rescinded the action described in such notice or (ii) the Borrower shall
not have entered into a Replacement Loan Agreement with a Replacement Lender as
contemplated under Section 3.10(b)(i), each other Senior Facility Lender shall
have the right to terminate its Commitment.

     3.10A. Single Lender Acceleration.

     (a) If JBIC shall have accelerated its Outstanding Base Amount, pursuant to
the terms of Section 10.02 of the JBIC Loan Agreement, by a notice delivered to
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, each other Senior Facility Lender shall
be entitled to suspend its obligation to make additional Advances, provided that
such suspension shall terminate (and each Senior Facility Lender shall no longer
be entitled


                                       20

<PAGE>

to suspend its obligation to make additional Advances solely by reason of such
suspension) if (i) JBIC rescinds the actions described in such notice or (ii)
the Borrower pays to JBIC the accelerated amount of the JBIC Outstanding Base
Amount with the proceeds of a Replacement Loan entered into with one or several
of the Parent Companies or their Affiliates or any third parties in an amount
equal to the accelerated amount of the JBIC Outstanding Base Amount.

     (b) If, 180 days after the date of acceleration by JBIC of its Outstanding
Base Amount, (i) JBIC has not rescinded the action described in such notice and
(ii) the Borrower has failed to pay JBIC as contemplated under clause (ii) of
clause (a) of this Section 3.10A, each other Senior Facility Lender by written
notice to the Borrower shall have the right:

          (i) To declare its Commitment to be cancelled and terminated whereupon
     the same shall be immediately cancelled and terminated; and/or

          (ii) To declare all Senior Loans Obligations payable to such Senior
     Facility Lender to be immediately due and payable, whereupon the same shall
     become immediately due and payable, without further notice and without
     presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
     hereby expressly waived by the Borrower.

     In addition, for the purpose of the exercise of remedies under the Master
Security Agreement, an MPA Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred on
the date of acceleration by JBIC of its Outstanding Base Amount.

     (c) If JBIC shall have both suspended, cancelled or terminated its
Commitment and accelerated its Outstanding Base Amount, each other Senior
Facility Lender and the Borrower shall have the rights set forth in Section 3.10
(with respect to the suspension, cancellation or termination of JBIC's
Commitment) and Section 3.10A (with respect to the acceleration of the JBIC
Outstanding Base Amount).

     3.11 Funding Losses. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Senior Facility
Lender and to hold such Senior Facility Lender harmless from any documented
loss, expense, liability or cost ("Funding Losses") which such Senior Facility
Lender may reasonably sustain or incur as a consequence of (i) any payment or
prepayment by the Borrower of principal of or interest on such Senior Facility
Lender's Outstanding Advance Amount for any reason (including, upon acceleration
in accordance with the Master Security Agreement or voluntary prepayment made
pursuant to Section 3.05) on any date other than an Interest Payment Date or
Payment Date, as the case may be, (ii) failure of the Borrower to pay any
principal of or interest on such Senior Facility Lender's Outstanding Advance
Amount, or any fee or other amount due hereunder when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) or (iii) after delivery of a Notice of
Borrowing, failure by the Borrower, for any reason, to satisfy any conditions


                                       21

<PAGE>

precedent in Article V hereof. The amount of any Funding Losses of each Senior
Facility Lender and a reasonably detailed description of the manner in which
such amount was determined shall be set forth in certificates from such Senior
Facility Lender, which certificates shall accompany a notice under this Section.
Each Senior Facility Lender shall deliver such notice and certificates to the
Borrower as promptly as practicable after such Senior Facility Lender becomes
aware of the Funding Losses described therein.

     3.12 Illegality.

     (a) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the adoption of or any
change in any Government Rule or in the interpretation or application thereof by
any Governmental Authority shall make it unlawful for any Senior Facility Lender
to make or maintain an Advance as contemplated by this Agreement, the obligation
of such Senior Facility Lender hereunder to make Advances shall terminate, and
such Senior Facility Lender shall have the right, subject to paragraph (b)
below, to declare its Outstanding Advance Amount (if any) together with interest
thereon, immediately due and payable.

     (b) Such Senior Facility Lender shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to change the lending office for its Commitment or Advances or assign such
portion of its Commitment or such Advance and transfer all of its rights and
obligations hereunder and under all other Financing Documents to which it is a
party, to a financial institution willing to purchase such assignment if such
assignment will avoid the need for the required repayment contemplated by
Section 3.12(a), provided that such Senior Facility Lender shall not be required
to take any step that, in its sole discretion, would result in any material cost
or that would otherwise be disadvantageous to such Senior Facility Lender.

start accruing on the date hereof and shall be payable in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Senior Facility Loan Agreement.

     4.02 Other Fees. The Borrower shall timely pay to each Senior Facility
Lender all other amounts due pursuant to the Senior Facility Loan Agreement to
which such Senior Facility Lender is a party.

replacement or termination is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Lender Effect; or (y) any Identified Material Project Document in circumstances
where such assignment, revision, amendment, modification, replacement or
termination is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Project Effect.

     (b) The Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of any

the outstanding Stand-By Amount of the Commercial Banks with the proceeds of the
issuance of the Peruvian Bonds, (ii) payment of Funding Losses and (iii)
mandatory prepayment contemplated in Section 3.12, such Senior Facility Lender

     11.01 Declaration of Event of Political Force Majeure. Upon the Continuance
of an Event of Political Force Majeure, the Administrative Agent (acting
pursuant to a Supermajority Facility Vote) shall have the right, by written
notice delivered in accordance with Section 11.02, to declare that an Event of
Political Force Majeure has occurred and is Continuing.

     11.02 Notices by Administrative Agent.

     (a) In order for the Administrative Agent to declare that an Event of
Political Force Majeure has occurred pursuant to Section 11.01, the
Administrative Agent shall deliver a certificate to the Borrower, setting forth
in reasonable detail, as applicable, (i) the events, conditions, circumstances
or occurrences that constitute an Event of Political Force Majeure, (ii) the
type of Event of Political Force Majeure which has occurred, and (iii) the date
as of which such Event of Political Force Majeure has occurred.

     (b) If an Event of Political Force Majeure declared under Section 11.01 has
ceased, the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from the Majority
Facility Lenders) shall deliver a notice to the Borrower declaring that such
Event of Political Force Majeure has ceased.

     11.03 Arbitration. The Borrower shall have 30 days after receipt of a
certificate delivered under Section 11.02 (a) to deliver a notice to the Senior
Facility Lenders to the effect that the Borrower (A) disagrees that an Event of
Political Force Majeure has


                                       66

<PAGE>

occurred and is Continuing and (B) intends to commence arbitration proceedings
under Section 12.17, within 45 days of such notice. Each such notice shall state
in reasonable detail the bases for the Borrower's disagreement. If the Borrower
does not timely deliver a notice under this Section or if such arbitration is
not timely commenced by the Borrower, a certificate delivered under Section
11.02 shall be considered determinative of the items addressed therein. Pending
resolution of the arbitration proceedings, the certificate delivered under
Section 11.02 shall be given effect, except that, if an arbitration commenced
pursuant to this Section 11.03 is pending when the time periods set forth in
Section 9.01(j) to declare an MPA Event of Default expires and the
Administrative Agent has declared such MPA Event of Default in accordance with
Section 9.02, such MPA Event of Default shall not become effective until the
conclusion of such arbitration (and then only if arbitrators rule the
declaration of an MPA Event of Default was permitted under this Agreement).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     12.01 Service Providers.

     (a) The Borrower shall have the right from time to time to appoint any
independent public accountant selected by the Borrower to replace the
Independent Public Accountants, so long as (i) the Borrower has given no less
than 15 Business Days advance written notice to the Administrative Agent and
(ii) the Borrower has not, within such period, received written objections from
the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from the Majority Facility
Lenders) to such appointment.

     (b) The Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from the Majority
Facility Lenders) may remove the Independent Engineer or the Insurance
Consultant with the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) of
the Borrower or, in the event that such Independent Engineer or the Insurance
Consultant, as the case may be, (i) ceases to be a consulting engineering firm
or an insurance consultant of recognized international standing, (ii) has become
an Affiliate of the Borrower or any of the Parent Companies, (iii) has developed
a conflict of interest that reasonably calls into question such firm's capacity
to exercise independent judgment or (iv) has failed to satisfactorily perform
its duties in its capacity as a Service Provider hereunder. If the Independent
Engineer or the Insurance Consultant is removed or resigns and thereby ceases to
act as Independent Engineer or the Insurance Consultant, as the case may be, for
purposes of this Agreement, (x) if no Borrower Event of Default has occurred and
is Continuing, the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from the
Majority Facility Lenders) shall, within 30 days of such removal and in any case
no later than 30 days after receipt of written request from the Borrower,
present to the Borrower a list of not less than four consulting engineering
firms or insurance consultants, as the case may be, from which the Borrower
shall select the replacement Independent Engineer or


                                       67

<PAGE>

Insurance Consultant, as the case may be and (y) if a Borrower Event of Default
has occurred and is Continuing, the Administrative Agent (acting upon
instructions from the Majority Facility Lenders) shall select the replacement
Independent Engineer or Insurance Consultant, as the case may be.

     12.02 Accession. A Replacement Lender or a Bridge Loan Provider, as the
case may be, may become a party to this Agreement by entering into a New Party
Accession Agreement and thereupon such Replacement Lender or Bridge Loan
Provider, as the case may be, shall have all the rights and obligations of the
applicable Suspending Lender.

     12.03 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall come into full force and effect
upon its execution and delivery by each of the parties named on the signature
pages hereof.

     12.04 Termination. (a) This Agreement shall terminate upon the full payment
of all Senior Facility Loans Obligations owed to the Senior Facility Lenders.
Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement as provided above in this
clause (a), the Borrower's obligations which are expressly provided in this
Agreement to survive shall survive.

     (b) Borrower may elect to terminate this Agreement by written notice to the
Administrative Agent thirty days after the date hereof (or such later date as
the Borrower and the other MPA Parties may agree) unless Borrower receives
evidence that the Hermes Guarantee has been issued and is in full force and
effect. Upon such election (i) the Borrower shall provide notice thereof to each
Senior Facility Lender, (ii) termination shall become effective 15 Business Days
from such notice and (iii) the costs and expenses section of the commitment
letters between the Borrower and the Senior Facility Lenders shall be
reinstated.

     12.05 Stability Agreement. Each of the Senior Facility Lenders hereby
acknowledges that a copy of the Stability Agreement has been made available to
it and that it has had adequate opportunity to review the Stability Agreement.
Each of the Senior Facility Lenders hereby accepts and acknowledges that the
Borrower does not intend to seek any new or amended stability agreement or other
agreement of a similar nature with respect to the Sulfide Project.

     12.06 Currency Equivalents. Calculation of currency equivalents (for any
amount, its "Equivalent") on any day shall be based on the foreign exchange spot
mid-rates for such day reported in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, or,
if not so reported, on the mid-market foreign exchange spot closing rates for
such day reported in the Financial Times, or, if not so reported, on spot
foreign exchange mid-market rates for trading among banks in amounts of
U.S.$1,000,000 and more as quoted by or to the Trustee.


                                       68

<PAGE>

     12.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

     12.08 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the MPA Parties agree to the fullest extent they may
effectively do so that the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

     12.09 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Financing Documents
constitute the entire agreement and understanding, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings (both written and oral), between the Borrower and
the Senior Facility Lenders with respect to the financing by the Senior Facility
Lenders of the Sulfide Project and there are no warranties, representations or
other agreements between such parties in connection with the subject matter
hereof except as specifically set forth herein and therein.

     12.10 Confidentiality.

     (a) The Administrative Agent and each Senior Facility Lender shall maintain
the confidentiality of all information disclosed to it concerning the Current
Operations, the Sulfide Project, the assets and businesses of the Borrower and
the Financing Documents and shall, unless otherwise required by law, not
voluntarily disclose it without the prior written consent of the Borrower to
anyone other than to the directors, officers, employees, accountants,
consultants, counsel and representatives of the Administrative Agent or such
Senior Facility Lender, or any provider of political risk insurance or guarantee
to such Senior Facility Lender or any proposed transferee of Senior Facility
Loans with a reasonable need to know such information (provided, in the case of
such a proposed transferee or participant, that such transfer is permissible
under this Agreement and provided further, in the case of a provider of
political risk insurance or guarantee or a proposed transferee or participant,
that such provider of political risk insurance or guarantee or proposed
transferee or participant, as the case may be, first agrees in writing to be
subject to this Section 12.10), except that this provision shall not prevent the
Administrative Agent or a Senior Facility Lender from disclosing information
that (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a
disclosure by such Person or its representatives in violation of this Agreement,
(ii) is or becomes available to such Person on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than the Borrower when such source is entitled to make such
disclosure or (iii) subject to paragraph (c) below, is required to be disclosed
in accordance with any applicable Governmental Rule.

     (b) If such information is so disclosed to any Person, the disclosing party
agrees to instruct such Person to keep such information confidential.


                                       69

<PAGE>

     (c) If such information is required to be disclosed in accordance with any
applicable Governmental Rule, unless specifically prohibited by applicable law
or court order, the disclosing party shall, prior to disclosure thereof, use its
best efforts to notify the Borrower of any request for disclosure of any such
information (i) by any Governmental Authority (other than any such request in
connection with an examination of the financial condition of any Senior Facility
Lender) or (ii) pursuant to any legal process, so that in each case the Borrower
may seek an appropriate protective order to maintain the confidentiality of such
information.

     (d) The agreements in this Section 12.10 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement.

     12.11 Notices. Any notice, request, demand, consent, designation,
direction, instruction, certificate, report or other communication to be given
hereunder shall be given in the English language and will be duly given when

sent) or facsimile transmission (with written confirmation of receipt, which
confirmation may be by facsimile transmission) to a party at its address and

     12.12 Benefits of Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the MPA Parties and their successors and
permitted assigns, any benefit or any legal or equitable right or remedy under
this Agreement.

     12.13 Successors and Assigns.

     (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Senior Facility Lenders and their
respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent (acting upon instructions from all
Senior Facility Lenders).

     (b) Except with the prior written consent of the Borrower, which shall be
deemed given unless the Borrower objects (in writing) within 15 days of receipt
of notice, no Senior Facility Lender may assign any portion of its Commitment;
provided that no Borrower consent shall be required during the Continuance of a
Borrower Event of Default, and provided further that no Borrower consent shall
be required in the case of an assignment by a Commercial Bank to another Senior
Facility Lender.

     (c) Except with the prior written consent of the Borrower, which shall be
deemed given unless the Borrower either (x) reasonably objects (in writing)
within 15 days of its receipt of notice or (y) objects without reasons and makes
available an alternate purchaser prepared to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions, the portion of the Advance intended to be sold, no Senior Facility
Lender may assign all or any portion of any Advance made by such Senior Facility
Lender to any other lender, unless such assignee is (x) an Affiliate of such
assignor, (y) a provider of political risk insurance to such assignor or (z)
another Senior Facility Lender, provided that no Borrower consent shall be
required during the Continuance of a Borrower Event of Default.


                                       72

<PAGE>

     (d) In circumstances where Borrower's consent to the assignment of a
Commitment or an Advance is granted or where such transfer is allowed, (i) the
assignee (if not a Senior Facility Lender) shall first enter into an accession
agreement (a "Transferee Accession Agreement") substantially in the form of
Exhibit F pursuant to which such assignee shall become a party to this
Agreement, the Master Security Agreement, the Completion Guarantee and the
Transfer Restriction Agreement, (ii) the Borrower shall not be required to
assume any obligations or costs under the Financing Documents, including for any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes or any withholding tax liability, with respect
to the assignee in excess of such obligations or costs Borrower is required to
assume under the Financing Documents with respect to the assignor, (iii) the
assignor shall not assign any interest in a Commitment or an Advance in an
amount that is less than U.S.$5 million and (iv) the assignee shall be entitled
to the same rights and subject to the same restrictions as are set forth in this
Section 12.13 with respect to subsequent assignments by such assignee. Upon the
assignment by a Senior Facility Lender of the entirety of its undrawn
Commitments and of its interest in all outstanding Senior Facility Loans made by
such Senior Facility Lender, the assignor shall cease to be a Senior Facility
Lender under this Agreement, except that the assignor shall continue to enjoy
all rights of indemnification provided for hereunder that have occurred prior to
the assignment.

     (e) Each Senior Facility Lender may grant participations in all or any
portion of its Commitment or of any Advance made by such Senior Facility Lender
to any non-voting participant.

     12.14 Remedies.

     (a) Other than as stated expressly herein, no remedy herein conferred upon
the Senior Facility Lenders is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and
each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
other remedy given hereunder, under the other Financing Documents, or now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.

     (b) No failure on the part of any Senior Facility Lender to exercise and no
delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power,
or privilege under this Agreement or any other Financing Document shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power
or privilege under any such document preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. No Senior
Facility Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Senior
Facility Lender to perform its obligations hereunder or under any Senior
Facility Loan Agreement.

     (c) In case any Senior Facility Lender shall have proceeded to enforce any
right, remedy or power under this Agreement or any other Financing Document and
the proceeding for the enforcement thereof shall have been discontinued or
abandoned for


                                       73

<PAGE>

any reason or shall have been determined adversely to such Senior Facility
Lender, then and in every such case the Borrower and the Senior Facility Lenders
shall, subject to any effect of or determination in such proceeding, severally
and respectively be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and
under such other Financing Document.

     12.15 Execution in Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by the different MPA Parties on separate
counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original,
but all the counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

     12.16 Consent to Jurisdiction.

     (a) The Borrower hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for the benefit of
the Administrative Agent and each Senior Facility Lender, that, except as
contemplated in Section 12.17, any legal action, suit or proceeding against it
with respect to its obligations, liabilities or any other matter under or
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Senior Facility Loans
Obligations may be brought in any Federal or State court located in New York
County in the City of New York and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of such court with respect to any such action, suit
or proceeding. The Borrower hereby waives any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions, suits or
proceedings, brought in any such court and hereby further waives and agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought therein has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

     (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints CT Corporation, with offices
at the date of this Agreement at 111 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY, as its
authorized agent on which any and all legal process may be served in any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any Federal or State court located in New
York County in the City of New York. The Borrower agrees that service of process
in respect of it upon such agent, together with written notice of such service
given to it in the manner provided in Section 12.11 hereof, shall be deemed to
be effective service of process upon it in any such action, suit or proceeding.
The Borrower agrees that the failure of such agent to give notice to it of any
such service shall not impair or affect the validity of such service or any
judgment rendered in any action, suit or proceeding based thereon. If for any
reason such agent shall cease to be available to act as such, the Borrower
agrees to designate a new agent in New York County in the City of New York, on
the terms and for the purposes of this Section 12.16. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to limit the ability of the Administrative Agent or any Senior Facility
Lender to serve any such legal process in any other manner permitted by
applicable law or to obtain jurisdiction over the Borrower or bring actions,
suits or proceedings against them in such other jurisdictions, and in such
manner, as may be permitted by applicable law.


                                       74

     12.17 Arbitration.

     (a) Notwithstanding Section 12.16, any dispute regarding (i) the occurrence
of an Event of Political Force Majeure or (ii) the modification of the minimum
insurance requirements set forth in Appendix II shall be determined by
arbitration between the Borrower, on the one hand, and Senior Facility Lenders
on the other hand, in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in effect
on the date the arbitration is commenced. Such arbitration shall be the
exclusive method for resolution of the dispute, and the determination of the
arbitrators shall be final and binding (except to the extent there exist grounds
for modification, vacatur, remand, nonenforcement or similar judicial action
respecting an award under the applicable laws governing the recognition or
enforcement of arbitral awards) on the Borrower and all Senior Facility Lenders.
The MPA Parties agree that, subject to those laws, they will give conclusive
effect to the arbitrators' determination and award and that judgment thereon may
be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitral tribunal's authority,
if any, to determine its own jurisdiction does not affect the competent court's
power to review the arbitration award (including as to matters of the arbitral
tribunal's assertion of jurisdiction); nor shall such authority by the arbitral
tribunal deprive an enforcement court of the authority to review the arbitral
tribunal's assertion of jurisdiction. Each MPA Party shall bear its own costs in
any such arbitration, provided that, if the arbitral tribunal concludes that any
MPA Party shall have acted unreasonably it may, in its discretion, award costs
against such MPA Party.

     (b) The number of arbitrators shall be three, each of whom shall be
disinterested in the dispute or controversy and shall be impartial with respect
to all parties hereto and independent thereof. Within 30 days of the initiation
of the arbitration, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (acting upon
instructions from the Majority Facility Lenders) shall each appoint one
arbitrator and the third arbitrator, who shall serve as the chair of the
arbitral tribunal, shall be appointed in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules in effect on the date the arbitration is commenced. Should the
services of an appointing authority be necessary, the appointing authority shall
be the American Arbitration Association.

     (c) The place of arbitration shall be New York, New York, United States of
America. The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and any
documents or portions thereof presented at such arbitration in a language other
than English shall be accompanied by an English translation thereof. The
arbitrators shall give effect insofar as possible to the desire of the parties
hereto that the dispute or controversy be resolved in accordance with good
commercial practice. The arbitrators shall decide such dispute in accordance
with the law of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law
principles thereof, provided that the arbitration and this arbitration agreement
shall be governed by Title 9 (Arbitration) of the United States Code.


                                       75

<PAGE>

     (d) The MPA Parties agree that it is of paramount importance that disputes
subject to this agreement to arbitrate be resolved expeditiously, and they
therefore charge the arbitral tribunal to schedule submissions and otherwise
conduct the proceedings in a manner designed to reach a final award as quickly
as possible consistent with the opportunity for the tribunal to fully inform
itself and the right of the MPA Parties to be fully heard.

     (e) If a Lead Arbitration proceeding is commenced under clause (a) of this
Section with respect to a dispute regarding the occurrence, continuance or
cessation of a given Event of Political Force Majeure, and if, at any time,
there shall also be pending a Parallel Arbitration with respect to a dispute
regarding the occurrence, continuance or cessation of the same Event of
Political Force Majeure, the Lead Arbitration shall have priority and the
parties shall take (and shall take all steps within their control to cause the
parties to the Parallel Arbitration to take) all reasonable steps to obtain a
stay of the Parallel Arbitration, which stay shall remain in effect pending the
issuance of any award or awards in the Lead Arbitration and, further, pending
conclusion of any judicial proceedings to enforce, vacate, modify, or remand any
award or awards as provided by law. Subject to the conclusion of those judicial
proceedings, if any, and the rights of the parties to the Lead Arbitration to
contest any arbitral award or its enforcement as provided by law, any arbitral
award entered in the Lead Arbitration shall be dispositive of any dispute
regarding the occurrence, continuance or cessation of the Event of Political
Force Majeure that was the subject of the Parallel Arbitration and the tribunal
in the Parallel Arbitration shall enter into an award determinative between the
MPA Parties in accord with the determination in the Lead Arbitration.

     12.18 No Trial by Jury. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any
legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

     12.19 Amendments and Waivers.

     (a) Neither this Agreement nor any terms hereof may be amended,
supplemented or modified other than pursuant to a written instrument executed by
(i) Borrower, (ii) the Administrative Agent, acting in accordance with Section
10.01 and (iii) with respect to any amendment, supplement or modification that
modifies any provision of this Agreement in a manner that adversely affects any
rights of the Administrative Agent hereunder or enlarges its duties hereunder,
the Administrative Agent.

     (b) No waiver by any party hereto of any of its rights, powers and
privileges under this Agreement shall be effective other than pursuant to a
written instrument executed by the Party waiving such right, power or privilege,
except that a waiver of rights, powers and privileges by the Senior Facility
Lenders can be executed by the Administrative Agent acting in accordance with
Section 10.01.

     12.20 Senior Facility Lenders' Credit Decisions.

     (a) Each Senior Facility Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Senior Facility
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each
Senior Facility Lender also acknowledges that it shall, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Senior Facility
Lender based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking
action under any Financing Document.

     (b) No implied representation, warranty or covenant of the Borrower shall
be read into this Agreement other than as expressly set forth herein.

     12.21 Payment of Expenses.

     (a) The Borrower shall on the Closing Date reimburse to the Senior Facility
Lenders all the expenses set forth in their respective Senior Facility Loan
Agreement.

     (b) Without limiting the obligations of the Borrower under clause (a)
above, the Borrower agrees (i) to pay or reimburse each Senior Facility Lender
for all of its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, waiver or

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) any Senior
Facility Loans or the use of the proceeds therefrom or (iii) any claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,

damage or expense arising as a result of operations, environmental contamination
or any Release or threatened Release that shall occur during any period when the
Indemnitee or other representative of the Senior Facility Lenders shall be in
possession of or controlling any such site or facility following the exercise by
the Appointed Parties or any Senior Facility Lender or other representative of
the Senior Facility Lenders of any

but including any such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense arising as a
result of operations, environmental contamination or any such Release or
threatened Release occurring during such period that is caused by, is a

                                   Schedule D

                         Description of Sulfide Project

     The project consists of an expansion of the current open pit mine, new
primary sulfide mill and concentrator, new tailing storage facility and
ancillary facilities to mine and process the primary sulfide ore and produce
copper and molybdenum concentrates. The process facilities include three stage
crushing, ball mill comminution, rougher flotation, and two stages of cleaner
flotation to produce bulk copper-molybdenum concentrate. Differential flotation
of the bulk concentrate produces separate copper and molybdenum concentrates,
both of which are dewatered by thickening and filtration. The copper and
molybdenum concentrates are loaded onto ships for shipment (or alternatively
loaded onto trucks for transport) to smelting and molybdenum processing
facilities. The process tailing remaining after flotation are separated to
produce suitable material for construction of an embankment for the retention of
the balance of the tailing material. Major operating units are expected to be
substantially as set forth below or with such substitutions as deemed
substantially equivalent by the Borrower:

     A.   MINE

     Mining is accomplished by conventional open-pit methods and consists of an
expansion of the leach mining operation. The equipment fleet for the leach
operations has been augmented to meet the demands of both the leaching and
sulfide operations. The fleet consists of shovels, diesel rotary blasthole
drills, haul trucks, and support equipment to mine approximately 280,000
tonnes-per-day to sustain both primary sulfide milling and oxide & secondary
sulfide leach operations.

     B.   PROCESS PLANT

     The process facilities treat about an average of 108,000 tonnes-per-day of
primary sulfide ore to produce separate copper and molybdenum concentrates by
milling and differential flotation.

     The major operating units are as follows:

     -    primary crushing

     -    secondary cone crushing, tertiary HPGR crushing

     -    ball mill grinding

     -    rougher-scavenger flotation

<PAGE>

     -    concentrate regrind

     -    cleaner flotation

     -    concentrate thickening

     -    molybdenum recovery by multi-stage differential flotation

     -    molybdenum concentrate filtration and drying

     -    copper concentrate thickening

     -    copper concentrate filtration

     -    tailing thickening

     C.   RECLAIM AND FRESH WATER SUPPLY

     The water management system consists of the following items:

     -    A tailing water reclaim system consisting of barge mounted pumps to
          return water from the tailing impoundment to the concentrator for
          reuse.

     -    A sump located downstream of the tailing impoundment to collect water

                              ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

-    WASTE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. On December 17, 2004, the Borrower received a
     notice from the Health General Direction (DIGESA) requesting that the
     Borrower modify its waste water treatment system to comply with the water
     quality standards set forth in Executive Order No 17552 and corresponding
     administrative regulations. DIGESA then suggested that the Borrower should
     apply for a "recycling water authorization". The purpose of asking for a
     "recycling water authorization", even though the Borrower does not recycle,
     is to allow DIGESA to inspect the facilities and to verify that the Mine
     does not have any waste water discharge. This is the only procedure DIGESA
     has to certify that there is no waste water discharge.

-    FREDICON. FREDICON, a community association, filed two criminal claims
     against the Borrower for failure to water trees planted by FREDICON on the
     Borrower's property and for failure to plant additional trees on its
     property. The first criminal claim was dismissed as unfounded by the Second
     Crime Prevention Prosecutor, but nevertheless forwarded to the Penal
     Prosecutor. The second criminal claim is still pending.

-    MR. HUMBERTO OLAECHEA FILED A CIVIL CLAIM (ACCION DE AMPARO) AGAINST THE
     BORROWER BEFORE THE 5TH CIVIL COURT OF AREQUIPA, asking the judge to stop
     the works for the change of the pipeline done in the zone near the tunnel
     on the way to the mine. The hearing took place on August 26, 2005.
     Resolution is still pending.

-    CLAIM FROM HUMBERTO OLAECHEA AGAINST THE BORROWER - Appeal of July 13, 2005
     by Humberto Olaechea Guillen of a prosecutor's decision that Borrower does
     not violate law by failure to water trees (Reg. No 2970).

-    CLAIM FROM HUMBERTO OLAECHEA AGAINST THE BORROWER- Appeal of July 13, 2005
     by Humberto Olaechea Guillen of a prosecutor's decision that Borrower does
     not violate law by performing work on its water pipeline (Reg. 2911).

-    PAMA. The Borrower received a notice from the Ministry of Energy and Mines
     that the "Programa de Adecuacion y Manejo Ambiental" ("PAMA") would need to
     be updated in order for it to built a new leaching facility to lixiviate
     the mineral for the cathode production ("Pad 5"). The construction for Pad
     5 was originally planned for 2005 but has been postponed until 2008. The
     Borrower has appealed the notice and has now been informed verbally that
     PAMA does not need to be

     amended, but that the Environmental Management Plan to be filed for the
     project will need to include Pad 5. The Borrower is planning to withdraw
     its appeal."

                                  LABOR MATTERS

     Law No 27942 and related administrative regulations, approved by Supreme
Decree No 010-2003-MIMDES, required employers to implement procedures to
protect employees from sexual harassment by March 2004. The Borrower did not
timely implement the procedures required under these regulation.

                                LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

JUAN NAVARRO MENDOZA (387-04 AND 383-04) AND OTHERS. On December 3, 2003, Juan
Navarro Mendoza and a group of approximately 20 farmers submitted an application
with the Special Land Titulation Project (PETT) to purchase approximately
105,000 hectares of land located in the Tiabaya 67 mining concession. Under
Peruvian law, PETT is authorized to sell available land, provided that such sale
will not interfere with any third party rights. The Borrower was granted title
to the Tiabaya 67 mining concession in 2000 and this mining concession is
recorded with INACC. PETT has ruled in favor of the Borrower. Despite this, the
farmers have now asked the Borrower through a mediator to pay approximately
US$25,000 in return for vacating the land. Tiabaya 67 is located at the edge of
the Borrower's concessions in the district of Yarabamba.

     NOTAS A LOS ESTADOS FINANCIEROS
     31 DE DICIEMBRE DEL 2004 Y 31 DE DICIEMBRE DEL 2003

1    ACTIVIDAD ECONOMICA

     SOCIEDAD MINERA CERRO VERDE S.A.A. (en adelante la Compania), subsidiaria
     de Cyprus Climax Metals Co. (Cyprus) propietaria del 82.48% de las acciones
     representativas de su capital social, se constituyo en el Peru el 20 de
     agosto de 1993 como resultado de la division de Empresa Minera del Peru
     (Minero Peru) encontrandose sus actividades reguladas por la Ley General de
     Mineria. Su domicilio legal es Av. Alfonso Ugarte No.304 - Arequipa. Su
     actividad principal es la extraccion, produccion y comercializacion de
     cobre en sus yacimientos ubicados al suroeste de la ciudad de Arequipa. La
     Compania cotiza sus acciones en la Bolsa de Valores de Lima.

     El personal empleado por la Compania para desarrollar sus actividades al 31
     de diciembre del 2004 ascendio a 665 funcionarios y empleados (603 al 31 de
     diciembre del 2003).

     Los estados financieros al 31 de diciembre del 2004 seran presentados a
     consideracion de la Junta General de Accionistas en los plazos establecidos
     por ley. En opinion de la Gerencia y el Directorio de la Compania, estos
     estados financieros seran aprobados sin modificaciones. Los estados
     financieros al 31 de diciembre del 2003 fueron aprobados por la Junta
     General de Accionistas del 14 de abril del 2004.

     PLANTA DE SULFUROS

     El 27 de setiembre del 2004, a traves de la Resolucion Directoral
     438-2004-MEM/AAM emitida por el Ministerio de Energia y Minas, se aprobo el
     Estudio de Impacto Ambiental del Proyecto Sulfuros Primarios. El 6 de
     octubre del 2004 el Directorio de Phelps Dodge Corporation, principal
     accionista de Cyprus, aprobo la construccion de la Planta de Sulfuros
     Primarios. El 28 de octubre del 2004 la Compania recibio la notificacion
     del Ministerio de Energia aprobando el proyecto.

     La inversion en este proyecto se estima en US$850 millones y sera
     financiado con recursos propios y con financiamiento de terceros. Se estima
     que la construccion de la Planta se llevara a cabo en dos anos, y se espera
     alcanzar los maximos niveles de produccion en el primer semestre del 2007.
     La produccion de cobre fino en promedio alcanza 90,000 TM al ano, y se
     estima que la inversion en este proyecto incrementara la produccion a
     260,000 TM por ano.

     Al 31 de diciembre del 2004, la Compania ha suscrito compromisos con
     proveedores de equipos y de servicios por un monto de aproximadamente US$40
     millones.

2    PRINCIPIOS Y PRACTICAS CONTABLES

     Los estados financieros se preparan de acuerdo con las disposiciones
     legales sobre la materia y los principios de contabilidad generalmente
     aceptados en el Peru. Los principios de contabilidad comprenden
     sustancialmente a las Normas Internacionales de Informacion Financiera
     (NIIF) las que incorporan a las Normas Internacionales de Contabilidad
     (NIC) oficializadas a traves de resoluciones emitidas por el Consejo
     Normativo de Contabilidad. A la fecha de los estados financieros, el
     Consejo Normativo de Contabilidad ha oficializado la aplicacion de las NIC
     de la 1 a la 41 y los pronunciamientos del 1 al 33 del Comite de
     Interpretaciones (SIC).

     Los principios y practicas contables mas importantes que han sido aplicados
     en el registro de las operaciones y la preparacion de los estados
     financieros son los siguientes:

     a)   Preparacion de estados financieros -

     De acuerdo con lo permitido por el Articulo 87 degrees del Codigo
     Tributario los registros contables de la Compania son mantenidos en dolares
     estadounidenses, que corresponde a su moneda de medicion, dado que la
     mayoria de sus transacciones son pactadas, cobradas y pagadas en esa
     moneda. Las transacciones efectuadas en nuevos soles son expresadas al tipo
     de cambio vigente de la fecha en que se realizan.

     b)   Uso de estimaciones contables -

     El proceso de preparacion de los estados financieros requiere que la
     Gerencia de la Compania lleve a cabo estimaciones y supuestos para la
     determinacion de los saldos de los activos y pasivos, el monto de las
     contingencias y el reconocimiento de los ingresos y gastos. En el caso que
     estas estimaciones y supuestos variaran como resultado de cambios en las
     premisas en las que se sustentaron, los correspondientes saldos de los
     estados financieros se corrigen en la fecha en la que el cambio en las
     estimaciones y supuestos se produce. Las principales estimaciones
     relacionadas con los estados financieros se refieren a la depreciacion de
     los bienes del activo fijo, la amortizacion de los gastos de desarrollo de
     mina, provisiones para obsolescencia de materiales y suministros, para
     remediacion y cierre de mina y el impuesto a la renta y la participacion de
     los trabajadores (corrientes y diferidos).

     c)   Instrumentos financieros -

     Los instrumentos financieros corresponden a los contratos que dan lugar,
     simultaneamente, a un activo financiero en una empresa y a un pasivo
     financiero o a un instrumento de capital en otra empresa. En el caso de la
     Compania, los instrumentos financieros corresponden a los depositos en
     entidades financieras, inversiones, cuentas por cobrar, cuentas por pagar,
     y hasta el 2003, a instrumentos derivados que corresponden a contratos de
     cobertura de tasas de interes.

     Las inversiones que se mantendran por un periodo de tiempo indefinido, que
     pueden ser vendidas por necesidades de liquidez o cambios en las tasas de
     interes, se clasifican como


                                       24

<PAGE>

     Pagina 3

     disponibles para la venta; estas inversiones se muestran como activos no
     corrientes a menos que la Gerencia tenga intencion expresa de mantener la
     inversion por menos de 12 meses contados desde la fecha del balance general
     o a menos que sea necesario venderlas para aumentar el capital operativo de
     la Compania, en cuyo caso se mostraran como activos corrientes. La Gerencia
     determina la clasificacion de sus inversiones en la fecha de su compra y
     evalua tal clasificacion periodicamente.

     Las compras y ventas de inversiones se reconocen en la fecha de la
     negociacion, que corresponde a la fecha en la que la Compania se compromete
     a comprar o vender el activo. El costo de adquisicion incluye los costos
     inherentes de la transaccion. Las inversiones disponibles para la venta son
     subsecuentemente registradas a su valor razonable. Las ganancias y perdidas
     realizadas y no realizadas que surgen de cambios en el valor razonable de
     inversiones disponibles para la venta se incluyen en los resultados del
     periodo en el que se originan.

     El valor razonable es el monto por el que un activo puede ser intercambiado
     entre un comprador y un vendedor debidamente informados, o puede ser
     cancelada una obligacion, entre un deudor y un acreedor con suficiente
     informacion, bajo los terminos de una transaccion de libre competencia. En
     este sentido, en opinion de la Gerencia, los valores en libros de los
     instrumentos financieros al 31 de diciembre del 2004 y al 31 de diciembre
     del 2003 no difieren significativamente de sus valores razonables. Las
     politicas contables sobre el reconocimiento y valuacion de estas partidas
     se revelan en las respectivas politicas contables descritas en esta Nota.

     d) Cuentas por cobrar comerciales -

     Los saldos de las cuentas por cobrar comerciales se registran a su valor
     nominal, neto del estimado de cuentas incobrables determinado sobre la base
     de la revision periodica de los saldos pendientes de cobro que considera,
     entre otros factores, la antiguedad de los saldos por cobrar y la
     viabilidad de su cobranza. Las cuentas incobrables se castigan cuando se
     identifican como tales.

     e) Existencias -

     Las existencias se valorizan al costo de produccion o adquisicion o a su
     valor neto de realizacion, el que resulte menor. La valuacion de las
     existencias se determina a traves de los metodos de ultimas entradas -
     primeras salidas (productos terminados y en proceso) y promedio (materiales
     y suministros). El costo de extraccion de mineral que incluye materiales,
     mano de obra, otros costos directos y gastos generales de produccion y
     excluye los gastos de financiamiento, es asignado a los productos
     terminados (catodos de cobre) y a los productos en proceso.

     El valor neto de realizacion de las existencias es el precio de venta
     estimado en el curso normal de las operaciones del negocio, menos los
     costos necesarios para terminar su produccion y los gastos de ventas. El
     costo de las existencias por recibir ha sido determinado segun el metodo de
     identificacion especifica.


                                       25

     f) Inmuebles, maquinaria y equipo -

     Los inmuebles, maquinaria y equipo se registran al costo, excepto por los
     activos adquiridos por Cyprus que se registran a su valor de transferencia
     menos una provision registrada para reducir su valor en libros a su valor
     recuperable estimado.

     Los gastos de mantenimiento y reparacion son cargados al costo de
     produccion cuando se incurren y las renovaciones y mejoras se capitalizan.
     Cuando el valor en libros es mayor que su valor recuperable estimado es
     inmediatamente reducido a su valor recuperable. El costo y la depreciacion
     acumulada de los activos vendidos o retirados se eliminan de sus
     respectivas cuentas y la utilidad o perdida relacionados con activos
     permanentes se afecta al saldo de la depreciacion acumulada y los
     relacionados con activos moviles se afecta a resultados.

     La depreciacion de los inmuebles, maquinaria y equipo se calcula por el
     metodo de unidades producidas en funcion de la vida util de la mina en el
     caso de los activos permanentes y por el metodo de linea recta en el caso
     de los activos moviles. Las tasas anuales de depreciacion utilizadas para
     los activos moviles fluctuan entre 5% y 33%.

     g) Gastos de desarrollo de mina -

     Los gastos de desarrollo de los asientos mineros que, de acuerdo con
     estimaciones de la Gerencia, se estima beneficiaran la produccion en el
     futuro se capitalizan. Los gastos de exploracion de proyectos cuyos
     resultados en el futuro son inciertos se cargan a los resultados cuando se
     incurren. Los costos de desbroce incurridos hasta el 31 de diciembre de
     1999 en la preparacion de la mina se muestran en el rubro gastos de
     preparacion de mina del balance general y se amortizan en funcion del
     mineral extraido. Los costos de desbroce incurridos a partir del ano 2000
     se cargan al costo de produccion.

     h) Deterioro de activos -

     En el caso de ocurrencia de eventos o cambios economicos que indiquen que
     el valor en libros de los activos de vida util prolongada se ha
     deteriorado, la Compania estima su valor recuperable y si es necesario
     reconoce una perdida por deterioro con cargo a los resultados del
     ejercicio. Esta perdida es el monto en el que el valor en libros del activo
     es reducido a su valor recuperable. El valor recuperable de los activos
     corresponde al mayor valor entre el monto neto que se obtendria de su venta
     y su valor en uso. El valor de venta neto corresponde al monto que se
     obtendria de la venta del activo en una transaccion cerrada entre partes no
     relacionadas, el precio de referencia en un mercado activo o el de
     transacciones similares recientes. El valor en uso corresponde al valor
     presente de los flujos futuros estimados que se obtendrian del uso continuo
     del activo y de su disposicion final al termino de su vida util.

     Los supuestos en que se basan los estimados de flujos futuros estan sujetos
     a riesgos e incertidumbres. Cualquier diferencia entre los supuestos y las
     condiciones de mercado y/o el


                                       26

<PAGE>

     Pagina 5

     desempeno de la Compania podrian tener un efecto importante en la situacion
     financiera y los resultados de sus operaciones.

     i) Impuesto a la renta -

     El impuesto a la corriente se registra de acuerdo con la legislacion
     vigente (Nota 11).

     El impuesto a la renta diferido se registra por el metodo del pasivo
     reconociendo el efecto de las diferencias temporales que surgen entre la
     base tributaria de los activos y pasivos y su saldo en los estados
     financieros, aplicando la legislacion y la tasa de impuesto promulgadas o
     sustancialmente promulgadas. Las principales diferencias temporales se
     resumen en la Nota 8.

     Impuestos diferidos activos solo se reconocen en la medida que sea probable
     que se dispondra de utilidades gravables futuras contra las que se pueda
     utilizar estos beneficios tributarios.

     j) Provisiones -

     Las provisiones se reconocen cuando la Compania tiene una obligacion
     presente legal o asumida como resultado de hechos pasados, es probable que
     se requiera de la aplicacion de recursos para cancelar la obligacion y es
     posible estimar su monto confiablemente.

     La Compania estima el valor presente de su obligacion futura por
     remediacion y cierre de mina (pasivo por remediacion o "PPR"), e incrementa
     el valor en libros del activo (activo por remediacion o "APR") a retirarse
     en el futuro, el mismo que se muestra en el rubro Otros activos en el
     balance general. Posteriormente, el APR se atribuye a los resultados en el
     plazo de vida util de los activos que le dieron origen y es ajustado para
     reflejar los cambios que pudieran resultar por el paso del tiempo y de
     revisiones de, ya sea, la fecha de ocurrencia o el monto del valor presente
     originalmente estimados.

     k) Creditos tributarios por programas de reinversion -

     El beneficio tributario por programas de reinversion (Nota 11-c) se
     reconoce en el ejercicio en el que se restringen las utilidades, como una
     reduccion del impuesto a la renta a pagar.

     l) Reconocimiento de ingresos por venta -

     Los ingresos por venta de mineral se reconocen en el momento de entrega del
     mineral al transportista designado por el cliente, momento en el que se
     transfieren al cliente los riesgos y beneficios inherentes a la propiedad
     del mineral.


                                       27

     Pagina 6

     m) Contingencias -

     Los pasivos contingentes no se reconocen en los estados financieros y se
     exponen en notas a los estados financieros a menos que su ocurrencia sea
     remota. Los activos contingentes no se reconocen en los estados financieros

     n) Efectivo y equivalentes de efectivo -

     Para propositos del estado de flujos de efectivo, el efectivo y
     equivalentes de efectivo comprenden el efectivo disponible, depositos a la
     vista en bancos y otras inversiones altamente liquidas de corto plazo.

     o) Nuevos pronunciamientos contables -

     A la fecha el Comite de Normas Internacionales de Contabilidad (IASB por
     sus siglas en ingles) ha completado el proceso de revision de las Normas
     Internacionales de Contabilidad, proceso que se conoce como el "Proyecto de
     Mejora" y ha emitido nuevas normas contables. Todas las revisiones de las
     NIC existentes y las nuevas NIIF emitidas (seis) tienen vigencia a nivel
     internacional a partir del 1 de enero de 2005; con excepcion de la NIIF 6
     cuya vigencia es a partir del 1 de enero del 2006. A la fecha estas normas
     no han sido aprobadas en el Peru por el Consejo Normativo de Contabilidad.
     La Gerencia esta evaluando el impacto que significara la adopcion de las
     NIC revisadas y las nuevas NIIF emitidas en los estados financieros de la
     Compania.

     Como parte del proyecto de mejora de las NIC llevado a cabo, quince NIC
     fueron revisadas con el objetivo de reducir o eliminar procedimientos
     alternativos, redundancias y conflictos entre las normas, para tratar con
     ciertos aspectos de convergencia, sustancialmente con las normas
     norteamericanas, e introducir otras mejoras.

     Las NIC modificadas por el proyecto se detallan a continuacion:

     -    NIC 1 (revisada en el 2003) afecta la presentacion del interes
          minoritario y otras revelaciones.

     -    NIC 2 (revisada en el 2003) elimina el metodo de valuacion de ultimas
          entradas - primeras salidas.

     -    NIC 8, 10, 16, 17, 21, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 33, y 40 (revisadas en el
          2003) y la NIC 39 (revisada en el 2004) no contienen cambios
          importantes.

     En adicion como parte de la revision de las normas relativas a
     combinaciones de negocios, que resulto en la emision del NIIF 3, las NIC 36
     y 38 tambien fueron revisadas.

3    INVERSIONES DISPONIBLES PARA LA VENTA

     Al 31 de diciembre del 2004 este rubro comprende inversiones en Bonos del
     Tesoro Norteamericano que devengan un interes anual a una tasa variable.
     Estas inversiones se mantendran por tiempo indefinido y pueden ser vendidas
     cuando lo requiera la Compania. Estas inversiones se clasifican como
     activos corrientes dado que la Gerencia estima venderlas para aumentar el
     capital operativo de la Compania. El valor en libros de estas inversiones
     corresponde a su valor razonable a la fecha de los estados financieros.
     Estos bonos han devengado intereses por US$591,000 que se incluyen en la
     cuenta de gastos financieros, neto en el estado de ganancias y perdidas.

     con la transferencia del 10% de la utilidad neta anual hasta alcanzar un
     monto equivalente al 20% del capital pagado. En ausencia de utilidades no
     distribuidas o de reservas de libre disposicion, la reserva legal debera
     ser aplicada a la compensacion de perdidas, debiendo ser repuesta con las
     utilidades de ejercicios posteriores. Esta reserva puede ser capitalizada
     siendo igualmente obligatoria su reposicion.

     d) Resultados acumulados -

     En virtud de los contratos de estabilidad tributaria suscritos con el
     Estado Peruano (Nota 11- a), la Compania esta autorizada a transferir al
     exterior, en divisas libremente convertibles, el integro de sus capitales y
     dividendos registrados en el organismo nacional competente. Asimismo, los
     dividendos y cualquier otra forma de distribucion de utilidades no
     constituyen renta gravable para efectos del impuesto a la renta.

     Al 31 de diciembre del 2004 esta cuenta incluye US$4.9 millones que seran
     transferidos en el 2005 a una cuenta especial en el patrimonio neto
     denominada utilidades restringidas. Este monto corresponde a la inversion
     sobre la que se calculo el credito contra el impuesto a la renta del ano
     2004 en aplicacion del Programa de Reinversion por el periodo de octubre
     del 2004 a febrero del 2007 (Nota 11- c).

     En adicion, esta cuenta incluye US$8.8 millones correspondiente a la
     utilidad del ano 2004 que sera transferido a la reserva legal en el 2005.

11   SITUACION TRIBUTARIA

     a)   El 16 de marzo de 1994 la Compania suscribio un contrato de garantias
          y medidas de promocion a la inversion, mediante el cual se otorga
          ciertas garantias a la Compania entre las que se encuentra la
          estabilidad en el regimen tributario vigente en la fecha de aprobacion
          del plan de inversion de la Compania. El 4 de noviembre de 1994 la
          Compania cumplio con las condiciones de dicho contrato y recibio la
          aprobacion del Gobierno en diciembre de 1994.

          En adicion, el 13 de febrero de 1998 la Compania suscribio un contrato
          con las mismas caracteristicas del anterior con relacion a una
          inversion de US$224,980,000, recibiendo la aprobacion del Gobierno en
          noviembre de 1998. De acuerdo con los terminos del contrato, el plazo
          de duracion de la estabilidad del regimen tributario se extiende por
          un periodo de 15 anos contados a partir del 1 de enero de 1999.

     b)   La Gerencia considera que ha determinado la materia imponible bajo el
          regimen general del impuesto a la renta de acuerdo con la legislacion
          tributaria vigente en la fecha del contrato antes mencionado, la que
          exige agregar y deducir al resultado antes de impuestos y
          participaciones, las partidas que la referida legislacion reconoce
          como gravables y no gravables, respectivamente.

          Al 31 de diciembre del 2004 y 2003 la tasa del impuesto a la renta es
          de 30%. En adicion al regimen general, la empresa esta sujeta al
          impuesto minimo a la renta equivalente al 2% del total de sus activos
          netos de depreciaciones y amortizaciones. El impuesto cargado a
          resultados del ano 2003 corresponde al mayor entre el impuesto a la
          renta del regimen general y el impuesto minimo a la renta. En el ano
          2003 el impuesto a la renta corresponde al regimen del impuesto
          minimo.

     Al 31 de diciembre del 2003 no se ha efectuado esta conciliacion debido a
     que en dicho ano el impuesto minimo resulto mayor que el impuesto a la
     renta del regimen general.

c)   De acuerdo con el Decreto Supremo No 07-94-EF, la Compania puede obtener un
     beneficio tributario (credito por reinversion) aplicando las utilidades no
     distribuidas a programas de inversion orientados a lograr un incremento de
     los niveles de produccion (Programa de Reinversion). Los creditos por
     reinversion equivalen al 80% del monto invertido y son obtenidos mediante
     solicitud y aprobados por el Ministerio de Energia y Minas.

     Con fechas 3 de setiembre y 25 octubre del 2004 la Compania remitio para la
     aprobacion del Ministerio de Energia y Minas el Programa de Reinversion por
     el periodo de octubre del 2004 a febrero del 2007 por US$800,030,000
     relacionado con las obras e infraestructura para la construccion de una
     planta concentradora para procesar adicionalmente 108,000 TM/dia de mineral
     de sulfuros primarios para producir concentrado de cobre, lo que se
     incrementara la capacidad de 39,000 TM/dia a 147,000 TM/dia de mineral de
     cobre.

     El 9 diciembre del 2004, a traves de la Resolucion Ministerial
     No.510-2004-MEM/DM, el Ministerio de Energia y Minas aprobo el Programa de
     Reinversion solicitado por la Compania con cargo a utilidades no
     distribuidas por el periodo antes indicado.

     En aplicacion de este programa, durante el ano 2004 la Compania reconocio
     un beneficio de US$4.9 millones correspondientes a las utilidades de dicho
     ano con cargo a la materia imponible que genero un menor impuesto de US$1.5
     millones.

d)   La Administracion Tributaria tiene la facultad de revisar y, de ser el
     caso, corregir el impuesto a la renta determinado por la Compania en los
     cuatro ultimos anos, contados a partir de la presentacion de la declaracion
     jurada del impuesto correspondiente (anos abiertos a fiscalizacion).

     En el caso del impuesto a la renta, los anos 1999 al 2003 inclusive, estan
     sujetos a fiscalizacion. En el caso del Impuesto General a las Ventas el
     periodo sujeto a fiscalizacion corresponde al comprendido entre diciembre
     de 1999 y diciembre del 2003. Debido a que pueden producirse diferencias en
     la interpretacion por parte de la Administracion Tributaria sobre las
     normas aplicables a la Compania, no es posible anticipar a la fecha si se
     produciran pasivos tributarios adicionales como resultado de eventuales
     revisiones. Cualquier impuesto adicional, moras, recargos e intereses, si
     se produjeran, seran reconocidos en los resultados del ano en el que la
     diferencia de criterios con la Administracion Tributaria se resuelva. La
     Gerencia y sus asesores legales estiman que no surgiran pasivos de
     importancia como resultado de estas posibles revisiones.

15   ADMINISTRACION DE RIESGOS FINANCIEROS

     Factores de riesgo financiero

     Las actividades de la Compania la exponen a ciertos riesgos financieros,
     que incluyen los efectos de las variaciones en los precios de mercado de
     los minerales, variaciones en los tipos de cambio y en las tasas de
     interes. Al 31 de diciembre del 2004 la Compania no mantiene este tipo de
     contratos de cobertura a estos riesgos. Por otro lado, como parte de Phelps
     Dodge Mining Company, ciertos riesgos financieros como variacion de precios
     y riesgo de cambio son cubiertos a nivel del grupo tomado en su conjunto.

     i)   Riesgo de tipo de cambio

     La Compania opera principalmente en dolares estadounidenses y registra sus
     operaciones en dicha moneda. Sus ventas, compras y gastos operativos son
     sustancialmente efectuados en dicha moneda, reduciendo asi el riesgo de
     verse afectada por las variaciones en los tipos de cambio en relacion con
     el nuevo sol peruano.

     ii)  Concentracion de ventas y riesgo crediticio

     La Compania realiza ventas a una afiliada del exterior y companias locales
     no relacionadas. Las ventas por concentracion geografica son las
     siguientes:

                 =======   =======
</TABLE>

     La Compania ha establecido politicas para asegurar que la venta de bienes y
     servicios se efectuan a clientes con adecuada historia de credito.

     iii) Riesgo de liquidez

     La administracion prudente del riesgo de liquidez implica mantener
     suficiente efectivo y equivalentes de efectivo, la disponibilidad de
     financiamiento a traves de una adecuada cantidad de fuentes de credito
     comprometidas y la capacidad de cerrar posiciones en el mercado.

                                  Tax Liability

     The Borrower has been advised that under the current law of Peru:

1. Interest payments to a non-Peruvian governmental agency, in respect of a loan
granted by such agency with the purpose of encouraging, developing and promoting
certain activities in Peru, will be exempt from withholding tax until December
31, 2006 (the "Promotional Credit Regime"). If the Promotional Credit Regime is
not renewed, interest payments to non-Peruvian governmental agencies will be
subject to a 4.99% withholding tax rate, provided that the requirements
described in paragraph 2 below are met.

2. Payments to a Person that is not domiciled in Peru, other than interest
payments to a non-Peruvian governmental agency that qualifies for the
Promotional Credit Regime, in respect of a loan granted by such Person to a
borrower domiciled in Peru, will be subject to a 4.99% withholding tax rate,
provided that all of the following requirements are met:

(i) Amounts disbursed under the loan are transferred to the borrower through the
Peruvian financial system;

(ii) Payments made by the borrower in respect of the loan do not exceed PRIME
plus 6 percentage points (in the case of loans granted from the United States)
or LIBOR plus 7 percentage points (in the case of loans granted from other
countries);

(iii) Amounts disbursed under the loan are used in a business carried out in
Peru;

(iv) The lender and the borrower are not "related" parties, as such term is
defined in the tax laws of Peru; and

(v) The participation of the lender in the financing is not made with the sole
purpose of avoiding a direct debtor-creditor relationship between "related"
parties.

3. If the requirements set forth above are not met, amounts paid to a Person not
domiciled in Peru, in respect of a loan made by such Person, will be subject to
a 30% withholding tax rate in Peru.

                    REPAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT OF THE JBIC LOAN

          Section 4.01. Repayment of JBIC Loan. On each Payment Date, the
Borrower shall repay a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the JBIC
Loan outstanding on the Availability Period End Date in an amount equal to the
product of such aggregate principal amount of the JBIC Loan multiplied by the
percentage set forth on the Amortization Schedule with respect to such Payment
Date. The final principal installment shall be repaid on the Sixteenth (16th)
Payment Date and in any event shall be in an amount equal to the aggregate
principal amount of the JBIC Loan outstanding on such date. The final Payment
Date shall occur not later than ninety (90) months after the first Payment Date,
it being understood that in no event shall the Borrower be required to repay an
amount exceeding the principal amount of the JBIC Loan outstanding on such
Payment Date.

          Section 4.02. Amortization Schedule.

          (a) If any prepayment of the JBIC Loan occurs, the amount prepaid
shall be deducted ratably from each of the installments shown in the
Amortization Schedule.

          (b) Promptly after the Availability Period End Date, or, if any

promptly after such adjustment, the JBIC Agent (in consultation with JBIC) shall
prepare and deliver to the Borrower a notice together with the adjusted
Amortization Schedule setting forth the amount of each installment to be repaid
by the Borrower on each Repayment Date. Such adjusted Amortization Schedule
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

          Section 4.03. Voluntary Prepayment.

          (a) Except as expressly provided otherwise in the Master Participation
Agreement, the Borrower may not voluntarily prepay all or any part of the JBIC
Loan.

          (b) Subject to satisfaction of the terms of Sections 3.04 and 3.05 of
the Master Participation Agreement, the Borrower may, on any Payment Date
falling after the Completion Release Date and upon giving no less than sixty
(60) days' prior written irrevocable notice to the JBIC Agent and to JBIC (which
notice shall state the amount to be prepaid and the Payment Date on which such
voluntary prepayment shall be made; such notice, a "PREPAYMENT NOTICE"), prepay
in advance of maturity all or any part (but if in part the amount of any
prepayment shall be at least five million five hundred thousand Dollars
(U.S.$5,500,000)) of the JBIC Loan, together with all interest accrued thereon
up to and including the day immediately preceding the date of such prepayment.
Once given, a Prepayment Notice may not be withdrawn.

          (c) In the event of a voluntary prepayment, the Borrower shall pay a
prepayment premium of one-half of one per cent (0.5%) of the amount of principal
amount of Tranche A to be prepaid to JBIC, which premium shall be paid
simultaneously with such prepayment (the "PREPAYMENT PREMIUM"). Once the date
for any voluntary prepayment has been notified pursuant to clause (b) above,
such date shall be deemed as the due date for the amounts to be paid on that
date (including the Prepayment Premium), and should the Borrower


                                       -7-

<PAGE>

fail to pay any such amount on such date, the Borrower shall pay interest on
such overdue principal and/or interest and/or Prepayment Premium. Any request
for prepayment made by the Borrower in accordance with this Agreement shall be
irrevocable and the Borrower shall be bound to prepay the JBIC Loan in
accordance therewith.

          Section 5.02. Overdue Payment.

          (a) If the Borrower fails to pay any principal or interest payable
under this Agreement with respect to Tranche A on the due date thereof (such

the Borrower shall pay JBIC interest (hereinafter referred to as the "TRANCHE A
OVERDUE INTEREST") on such Tranche A Overdue Amount for the period from and
including the due date thereof up to and excluding the date of actual receipt of
the payment by JBIC (hereinafter referred to as the "TRANCHE A OVERDUE PERIOD")
on demand, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, at the applicable
interest rate and margin set forth in Section 5.01 plus 2% per annum on each
Calculation Date. Such Tranche A Overdue Interest shall accrue after as well as
before judgment and in accordance


                                       -8-

<PAGE>

with Section 5.04. Interest at the rate stipulated in Section 5.01 shall not
accrue on any Tranche A Overdue Amount during this Period.

Calculation Date provided that, if JBIC has made a payment to the JBIC Tranche B
Funding Source Banks, under a political risk guarantee issued to such JBIC
Tranche B Funding Source Banks (a "GUARANTEE PAYMENT"), interest on such portion
of the Tranche B Overdue Amount equal to the amount of the Guarantee Payment
shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to the reasonably evidenced costs of
funds to JBIC of funding such Guarantee Payment from time to time, as determined
by JBIC in its sole discretion (if such rate is greater than the applicable
interest rate and margin set forth in Section 5.01(b)), plus 2% per annum. Such
Tranche B Overdue Interest shall accrue after as well as before judgment and in
accordance with Section 5.04. Interest at the rate stipulated in Section 5.01
shall not accrue on any Tranche B Overdue Amount during the Tranche B Overdue
Period.

          (c) Upon request by the Borrower, the JBIC Agent will promptly notify
the Borrower of the Floating Rate so determined by JBIC, provided that the
Borrower's obligation to pay such Tranche A Overdue Interest and Tranche B
Overdue Interest shall not be conditional upon notification of the relevant rate
to the Borrower by the JBIC Agent and such determination by JBIC shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d) Payment of interest by the Borrower in accordance with clause (a)
above shall not prejudice the right of JBIC to exercise any other of its rights
or claims hereunder, at law or otherwise to remedy any such failure to pay any
amount on the due date for payment hereunder.

Currency, as the case may be, shall not be discharged or satisfied by any
amount, tender or recovery (whether pursuant to any judgment or otherwise)
expressed, paid or made in or converted into any currency other than the
Eligible Currency or the Relevant Currency, as the case may be, except to the
extent to which such amount, tender or recovery so expressed, paid, made or
converted shall result in the effective receipt by JBIC of the full amount of
the Eligible Currency or the Relevant Currency, as the case may be, payable to
JBIC hereunder at any relevant time and accordingly the primary obligation of
the Borrower shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of
action for the purpose of recovery in the Eligible Currency or the Relevant
Currency, as the case may be, of the amount (if any) by which such effective
receipt shall fall short of the full amount of the Eligible Currency or the
Relevant Currency, as the case may be, payable hereunder, and shall not be

          Section 9.01. Environmental and Social Considerations.

          (a) The Borrower shall construct the Sulfide Project and operate the
Business in compliance with the JBIC Environmental Guidelines. If, due to
unforeseen circumstances, the Borrower learns that it is not in compliance with
the JBIC Environmental Guidelines, the Borrower shall promptly report such
non-compliance to JBIC.

          (b) The Borrower shall implement and maintain an environmental
monitoring program which monitors the environmental compliance of the Borrower
and its Business in accordance with Section 7.23 of the Master Participation
Agreement. The Borrower shall, upon JBIC's reasonable request, report to JBIC on
measures and monitoring related to environmental and social considerations
(hereinafter referred to as the "ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS")
undertaken by the Borrower in connection with its compliance with the JBIC
Environmental Guidelines (including, to the extent applicable, on the results of
discussions with stakeholders of the Business held in accordance with clause (c)
below). Such report shall be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
JBIC and shall address, among other matters, measures taken by the Borrower with
respect to air pollution, water pollution and disposal of wastes as they relate
to the Business. From and after the date of Start-up of Commercial Production,
the Borrower shall provide an annual environmental compliance report, in the
form attached hereto as Annex D, by no later than March 31st of each year. The
Borrower shall provide promptly upon request such other items as may be
reasonably requested in writing from time to time by JBIC or the JBIC Agent with
respect to the Borrower's compliance with Applicable Environmental Laws and the
JBIC Environmental Guidelines.

          (c) If any problems regarding the Environmental and Social
Considerations arise, the Borrower shall make reasonable efforts for discussions
to be held between the Borrower and stakeholders of the Business (including, to
the extent applicable, local residents and local NGOs affected by the Project).

          (d) When the Government of the Republic of Peru (including local
governments) and other stakeholders of the Business have important roles to play
in terms of the Environmental and Social Considerations, the Borrower shall
endeavor to enter into agreements with such parties.

          (e) If JBIC reasonably believes that the Borrower is not in compliance
with the JBIC Environmental Guidelines, JBIC or the JBIC Agent shall have the
right to notify the Borrower of the same and to request discussion with the
Borrower concerning such non-compliance. If, following discussion of such
non-compliance, JBIC continues to reasonably believe that the Borrower is not in
compliance with the JBIC Environmental Guidelines, JBIC shall have the right to
require that the Borrower permit JBIC, any environmental consultant chosen by
JBIC or any agent or representative thereof access to the Project Property, in
each case (i) at the expense of the Borrower and (ii) subject to the
confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 15.01.

          Section 9.02. Effect of Breach of Environmental and Social
Considerations. If the Borrower is in breach in any material respect of its
obligations under Section 9.01, then, after consultation between JBIC and the
Borrower, JBIC may send to the Borrower a notice of such breach (an "ALLEGED
BREACH NOTICE"). Thereafter, JBIC shall have the right to require that the
Borrower permit JBIC, any environmental consultant chosen by JBIC or any agent
or representative thereof access to the Project Property, (i) in each case at
the expense of the Borrower and (ii) subject to the confidentiality provisions
set forth in Section 15.01. If such breach remains uncured within ninety (90)
days after the receipt by the Borrower of an Alleged Breach Notice, JBIC or the
JBIC Agent may, by notice to the Borrower, declare that a JBIC Event of Default
has occurred in accordance with Section 10.01(c)(iii). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties acknowledge that neither JBIC nor the JBIC Agent shall
have the right to declare the occurrence of a JBIC Event of Default, if the
Borrower has within such ninety (90) day period adopted a plan reasonably
acceptable to JBIC to cure such breach and thereafter diligently implements such
plan.

          (b) Upon the occurrence and Continuance of an MPA Event of Default,
JBIC shall have each of the rights and remedies provided in Article V of the
Master Security Agreement exercisable only pursuant and in accordance to the
terms thereof.

          (c) Each of the following events shall be a "JBIC EVENT OF DEFAULT"

cancelled for any reason or amended, supplemented or otherwise modified to
reduce the quantity of minimum annual purchases thereunder or to reduce the term
thereof, and the same is not replaced within one hundred eighty (180) days with
equivalent arrangements acceptable to JBIC with customers in Japan;

                    (ii) if either SC or SMM is in breach of its obligations
under Section 2.01(c) of the Transfer Restrictions Agreement or the Sumitomo
Participant (or any Sumitomo Affiliate Transferee) makes or permits a Transfer
of its Restricted Common Stock that requires the prior written consent of JBIC
in accordance with Section 2.02(d) of the Transfer Restrictions Agreement
without the prior written consent of JBIC; or

                    (iii) if at any time (i) JBIC shall declare the existence of
a JBIC Event of Default in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.02 or
(ii) the representation and warranty made by the Borrower under Section 7.02
shall prove to have been false when made in any material respect and is not
corrected or cured within ten (10) Business Days after notice from JBIC or the
JBIC Agent specifying such breach and requesting that it be remedied.

          Section 10.02. Consequences of JBIC Event of Default. Upon the
occurrence of a JBIC Event of Default pursuant to Section 10.01, JBIC or the
JBIC Agent (acting on behalf of JBIC) may, by notice to the Borrower, take the
following actions, so long as such actions are taken concurrently: (i) terminate
its commitment to make available the JBIC Facility and (ii) declare the JBIC
Loan then outstanding, together with accrued interest and any other charges
thereon, to be immediately due and payable.

                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

          Section 11.01. Conditions Precedent to Initial Disbursement. The
obligation of JBIC to make the initial JBIC Disbursement under this Agreement
shall be subject to (a) the fulfillment, in a manner satisfactory to JBIC, prior
to or concurrently with the making of such initial JBIC Disbursement, of the

corresponding portion of Tranche B from each JBIC Tranche B Funding Source Bank.

obligation of JBIC to make any JBIC Disbursement under this Agreement subsequent

thereafter. The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the
Advances, provided that no claims shall be made by JBIC or the JBIC Agent under

and repayment of the Advances and all other amounts payable hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to Section 3.01 hereof, the Borrower
shall have no obligation to indemnify either JBIC or the JBIC Agent against any
losses, liabilities, obligations, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,

Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the

or thereto of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) the JBIC
Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom or (iii) any claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, regardless of

not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are incurred by reason of the
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee; provided further that in
each case JBIC or the JBIC Agent shall first have provided the Borrower with a
certificate

the prior written consent of the other parties hereto to anyone other than to
the directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, counsel and

under this Agreement and provided further, in a proposed transferee or
participant, the proposed transferee or participant, as the case may be, first
agrees in writing to be subject to this Section 15.01), except that this

its best efforts to notify the other parties hereto of any request for
disclosure of any such information (i) by any Governmental Authority (other than
any such request in connection with an examination of the financial condition of
any Senior Facility Lender) or (ii) pursuant to any legal process, so that in
each case the other parties


                                      -18-

<PAGE>

hereto may seek an appropriate protective order to maintain the confidentiality

exercising on the part of JBIC any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver

                             DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES

     Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties to this Agreement, JBIC
Disbursements under this Agreement and the Master Participation Agreement shall
be made in accordance with the following procedures:

          1. REQUEST FOR DISBURSEMENT

          1.1 Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Borrower
shall deliver to JBIC and the JBIC Agent a proposed schedule of disbursement for
the JBIC Loan substantially in the form of Schedule 4 to this Annex A.

          1.2 The Borrower shall, at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to
the intended date of Disbursement, submit to the JBIC Agent a duly completed
Request for Disbursement substantially in the form of Schedule 1 to this Annex A
signed by the Borrower and accompanied by a duly completed and signed Statement
of Expenditures substantially in the form of Schedule 2 to this Annex A.

          1.3 The Statement of Expenditures shall include the expenditures
already paid by the Borrower as Project Costs or estimated to be paid through
the relevant Disbursement Date. The Statement of Expenditures may also include
the expenditures that are scheduled to be paid by the Borrower during the ninety
(90) day period after the date of the relevant Statement of Expenditures (the
"Estimated Expenditures"), provided that should any Statement of Expenditures
include the Estimated Expenditures, the Borrower shall submit to the JBIC Agent
the revised relevant Statement of Expenditures promptly after such period.

          1.4 In the event that any expenditure shown in a Statement of
Expenditures is incurred in a currency other than the Eligible Currency, such
amounts shall be converted into the Eligible Currency at a rate of exchange
reasonably chosen by the Borrower and used by the Borrower for the preparation
of its financial statements, as set forth in the Statement of Expenditures.

          1.5 The Request for Disbursement and the Statement of Expenditures
shall be reviewed by the JBIC Agent as to its compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement. If the Request for Disbursement will result in breach of any
provision of this Agreement, the JBIC Agent, after consultation with JBIC, may
reject such Request for Disbursement.

          2. DISBURSEMENT

          2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
without limitation, Sections 11.01 and 11.02 and this Annex A, the JBIC Agent
shall, upon its receipt, notify JBIC of the date and the amount of the requested
JBIC Disbursement in a Request for Disbursement. On each Disbursement Date
before the close of business in Tokyo, JBIC shall disburse the Tranche A Loans
to the JBIC Agent Tokyo Disbursement Account and on or prior to 12:00 p.m., New
York time, the JBIC Tranche B Funding Source Banks shall disburse the

<PAGE>

Tranche B Loans into the JBIC Agent New York Disbursement Account and the
Disbursement Procedures set forth in Annex G (or such other procedures as may be
agreed by the parties from time to time) shall be observed, provided that, if
the said intended date of the JBIC Disbursement is not a Business Day, such JBIC
Disbursement shall be made on the immediately succeeding Business Day.

          2.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, JBIC shall be deemed to have made a
JBIC Disbursement to the Borrower at the time when JBIC disburses the Tranche A
Loans to the JBIC Agent Tokyo Disbursement Account and the Tranche B Loans are
disbursed into the JBIC Agent New York Disbursement Account in accordance with
Section 2.1 and shall, as from the date of such disbursement, constitute a valid
and binding obligation upon the Borrower in respect of repayment of the
corresponding amount of the JBIC Loan and the payment of interest and any other
amount payable hereunder in relation thereto, each in accordance with and in the
manner contemplated by this Agreement.

          2.3 No more than one (1) JBIC Disbursement shall be made hereunder in
any calendar month period. In addition, no JBIC Disbursement shall be made
during any thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the date of payment of
commitment charges pursuant to Section 5.03.

          2.4 In the event that the total amount set forth in the Statement of
Expenditures with respect to any JBIC Disbursement is less than the amount of
the JBIC Disbursement requested in the relevant Request for Disbursement, then
the JBIC Disbursement shall be made only up to the amount set forth in such
Statement of Expenditures. Except with respect to the last JBIC Disbursement,
each JBIC Disbursement shall not be less than five hundred thousand Dollars
(U.S.$500,000).

          2.5 Promptly after the JBIC Disbursement is made, the JBIC Agent shall
(i) notify the Borrower of the date and amount of the Disbursement by sending
two (2) original copies of the Table of Disbursements (the "Table of
Disbursements") substantially in the form of Schedule 3 to this Annex A to the
Borrower and (ii) send a copy thereof to JBIC. The Borrower, promptly after
receipt thereof, shall (i) duly acknowledge and confirm such Table of
Disbursements and return one (1) original copy to the JBIC Agent and (ii) send a
copy thereof to JBIC.

          3. GENERAL

     On each day on which a JBIC Disbursement shall be made, the amount of the
Facility shall be reduced by the amount of such JBIC Disbursement.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, JBIC shall not
be required to make any JBIC Disbursement hereunder if, as a result thereof, the
amount of the Facility would thereby be exceeded. JBIC Disbursements will be
made only during the Availability Period.

PREFACE

Japan Bank for International Cooperation (hereinafter referred to as "JBIC")
establishes and makes public "JBIC Guidelines for Confirmation of Environmental
and Social Considerations" (hereinafter referred to as the "Guidelines") with
the objective of contributing to efforts by the international community,
particularly developing regions, towards sustainable development, through
consideration of the environmental and social aspects in all projects
(hereinafter referred to as "project" or "projects") subject to lending or other
financial operations (hereinafter collectively referred to as "funding") by
JBIC. Environmental and social considerations refer not only to the natural
environment, but also to social issues such as involuntary resettlement and
respect for the human rights of indigenous peoples (hereinafter collectively
referred to as "environment"). The Guidelines apply commonly to JBIC's
International Financial Operations and Overseas Economic Cooperation Operations.

The Guidelines have been formulated on the basis of Japan's approach to
international co-operation in environmental conservation, discussions about the
international framework on environmental and social considerations and human
rights, and discussions held at the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (OECD) regarding common approaches to the environment and public
export credits, which requires consistency between public export credit policies
and environmental conservation policies, and also regarding good environmental
practices of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and other issues. The
Guidelines will be reviewed as necessary in future, taking into account future
progress made in these areas.

While encouraging appropriate consideration of the environment and social
aspects in projects subject to funding, it is JBIC's policy to provide active
support to projects that promote environmental conservation and to projects that
contribute to the protection of the global environment, such as projects to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. JBIC also has a policy of being actively
involved in the support of enhancing environmental and social considerations in
developing countries.

[PART 1]

1. JBIC'S BASIC POLICIES REGARDING CONFIRMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
CONSIDERATIONS

JBIC confirms that project proponents are undertaking appropriate environmental
and social considerations, through various measures, so as to prevent or
minimize the impact on the environment and local communities which may be caused
by the projects for which JBIC provides funding, and not to bring about
unacceptable effects. It will thus contribute to the sustainable development of
developing regions.

In its confirmation of environmental and social considerations, JBIC places
importance on dialogue with the host country (including local governments),
borrowers and project proponents (hereinafter collectively referred to as
"borrowers and related parties") regarding environmental and social
considerations, while respecting the sovereignty of the host country. It also
takes note of the importance of transparent and accountable processes, as well
as the participation in those processes of stakeholders in the project
concerned, including local residents and local NGOs affected by the project
(hereinafter referred to as "stakeholders"). JBIC makes clear in its Guidelines
the environmental and social considerations required for projects to receive
JBIC's funding, and confirms those environmental and social considerations.

In making its funding decisions, JBIC conducts screenings and reviews of
environmental and social considerations to confirm that the requirements are
duly satisfied.

JBIC makes the utmost efforts to ensure that appropriate environmental and
social considerations are undertaken, in accordance with the nature of the
project for which JBIC provides funding, as stated in the Guidelines, through
such means as loan agreements.

Following funding decisions, if necessary, JBIC will monitor or take steps over
a certain period of time to encourage borrowers and related parties to ensure
that appropriate environmental and social considerations are undertaken.

In cases where it is involved in the planning and preparatory stages of a
project, JBIC will take steps to encourage borrowers and related parties to
undertake appropriate environmental and social considerations from the earliest
stage possible.


                                        1

<PAGE>

JBIC consistently strives to improve its organizational structure and
operational capacity to achieve sufficient and effective confirmation of
environmental and social considerations.

2. OBJECTIVES AND MEANING OF THE GUIDELINES

The objective of the Guidelines is to encourage project proponents to implement
appropriate environmental and social considerations in accordance with the
Guidelines, by making clear its procedures (both before and after funding
decisions are made), criteria for decision-making and requirements which
projects subject to funding are to meet. In so doing, JBIC endeavors to ensure
transparency, predictability and accountability in its confirmation of
environmental and social considerations.

3. BASIC PRINCIPLES REGARDING CONFIRMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
CONSIDERATIONS

(1) Parties Responsible for Environmental and Social Considerations The project
proponents are responsible for environmental and social considerations for the
project. JBIC confirms such considerations in light of the Guidelines. JBIC
encourages project proponents seeking funding from JBIC to undertake appropriate
environmental and social considerations in accordance with the nature of the
project, based on the principles listed in Section 1 of Part 2 of the
Guidelines.

(2) Confirmation of Environmental and Social Considerations by JBIC. JBIC does
the following to confirm environmental and social considerations;

(a)  classifies the project into one of the categories listed in Section 4.(2)
     of Part 1 (hereinafter referred to as "screening");

(b)  conducts a review of environmental and social considerations when making a
     decision on funding, to confirm that the requirements are duly satisfied
     (hereinafter referred to as "environmental review"); and

(c)  conducts monitoring and follow-up after the decision has been made on
     funding (hereinafter, such monitoring and follow-up processes will be
     simply referred to as "monitoring").

JBIC conducts screening and environmental reviews of projects for which it
intends to provide funding before it makes decisions on funding.

In light of the Guidelines and taking into account the characteristics of the
project and the particular circumstances of the country and its location, JBIC
confirms in its environmental reviews: 1) whether appropriate and sufficient
consideration is given to environmental and social issues before the
implementation of the project, 2) whether appropriate environmental and social
considerations can be expected after JBIC makes decisions on the funding of the
project in light of such factors as the state of preparation by the project
proponent and host government, their experience, operational capacity, and the
state of securing funds, as well as external factors of instability.

From the standpoint that confirmation of environmental and social considerations
is an important aspect in the risk assessment for the funding, JBIC carries out
environmental reviews in strict


                                        2

<PAGE>

conjunction with its financial, economic and technical review of projects.

As well as undertaking efficient pre-funding screening and environmental reviews
through the appropriate use of "screening forms" and "environmental checklists",
amongst other means, JBIC places emphasis on post-funding monitoring.

(3) Information Required for Confirmation of Environmental and Social
Considerations JBIC conducts screening and environmental reviews based
principally on information provided by borrowers and related parties (in the
case of export finance, including exporters). However, JBIC may request
additional information from the borrowers and related parties when necessary.

JBIC recognizes the importance of information received not only from the
borrowers and related parties but also from governments and organizations of
host countries, co-financiers and stakeholders, and utilizes such information in
its screening and environmental reviews.

With respect to projects that are co-financed by other financial institution(s),
JBIC endeavors to exchange information on environmental and social
considerations with the other institution(s) concerned.

For Category A projects (see Section 4.(2) of Part 1), JBIC checks the extent of
stakeholder participation and information disclosure being undertaken for the
project, in accordance with the environmental impact assessment systems of the
host country.

JBIC may, when necessary, conduct surveys of proposed project sites by
dispatching environmental experts to confirm environmental and social
considerations.

JBIC may, when necessary, seek and make use of opinions from outside experts.

(4) Standards for Confirmation of Appropriateness of Environmental and Social
Considerations

JBIC in principle conducts environmental reviews to confirm that projects meet
the requirements for environmental and social considerations stated in the
Guidelines in the following ways: JBIC ascertains whether a project complies
with environmental laws and standards, of the host national and local
governments concerned, as well as whether it conforms to their environmental
policies and plans.

JBIC also uses, as reference points or benchmarks, examples of standards and/or
good practices regarding environmental and social considerations established by
international and regional organizations and developed countries such as Japan.
If JBIC believes the environmental and social considerations of the project
substantially deviate from these standards and good practices, it will consult
with the host governments (including local governments), borrowers and project
proponents to confirm the background and rationale for this deviation.

JBIC takes note of the importance of good governance with regard to projects for
the sake of appropriate environmental and social considerations.

(5) Taking into Account for Funding Decisions

JBIC takes the outcomes of its environmental reviews into account for decisions
on funding. If, as a result of its environmental review, JBIC judges that
appropriate environmental and social considerations are not ensured, it will
encourage the project proponent, through the borrower, to undertake appropriate
environmental and social considerations. If appropriate environmental and social
considerations are not undertaken, there may be cases where funding is not
extended.

4. PROCEDURES FOR CONFIRMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

(1) Screening

Before starting an environmental review of a project, JBIC classifies the
project into one of the following categories. The subsequent environmental
review will then be conducted in accordance with the procedures for that
category.

JBIC requests the borrowers and related parties to submit the necessary
information promptly so that it may perform the screening process at an early
stage.

During the screening process, JBIC classifies each project in terms of its
potential environmental impact, taking into account such factors as: the sector
and scale of the project, the substance, degree and uncertainty of its potential
environmental impact and the environmental and social context of the proposed
project site and surrounding areas.

JBIC may revise the categorization when necessary, e.g., in cases where
environmental impact worth considering comes to light even after the screening
based on the information provided by the borrowers and related parties is
performed.

(2) Categorization

Category A: A proposed project is classified as Category A if it is likely to
have significant adverse impact on the environment. A project with complicated
impact or unprecedented impact which are difficult to assess is also classified
as Category A. The impact of Category A projects may affect an area broader than
the sites or facilities subject to physical construction. Category A, in
principle, includes projects in sensitive sectors (i.e., sectors that are liable
to cause adverse environmental impact) or with sensitive characteristics (i.e.,
characteristics that are liable to cause adverse environmental impact) and
projects located in or near sensitive areas. An illustrative list of sensitive
sectors, characteristics and areas is given in Section 3 of Part 2.

Category B: A proposed project is classified as Category B if its potential
adverse environmental impact is less adverse than that of Category A projects.
Typically, this is site-specific, few if any are irreversible, and in most cases
normal mitigation measures can be designed more readily. Projects funded by
Engineering Service Loans that are yen loans for survey and design, are
classified as Category B, with the exception of those belonging to Category C.

Category C: A proposed project is classified as Category C if it is likely to
have minimal or no adverse environmental impact. Projects that correspond to one
of the following are, in principle, classified as Category C, with the exception
of projects with sensitive characteristics and projects located in sensitive
areas as indicated in Section 3 of Part 2:

     1) Projects for which the JBIC's share is not above SDR 10 million;

     2) Sectors or projects in which no particular environmental impact would be
     normally expected (e.g., human resources development, support for
     international balance of payments, maintenance of existing facilities,
     acquisition of rights and interests without additional capital investment);
     or

     3) Cases in which there is only minor involvement of the project by the
     borrower or JBIC, such as the export/import or lease of items of machinery
     or equipment that is not connected with a particular project, and where
     there would be little reasonable significance in JBIC's conducting an
     environmental review.


                                       4

<PAGE>

Category FI: A proposed project is classified as Category FI if it satisfies all
of the following: JBIC's funding of the project is provided to a financial
intermediary etc.; the selection and assessment of the actual sub-projects is
substantially undertaken by such an institution only after JBIC's approval of
the funding and therefore the sub-projects cannot be specified prior to JBIC's
approval of funding (or assessment of the project); and those sub-projects are
expected to have potential impact on the environment.

(3) Environmental Review for Each Category

After the screening process, JBIC carries out environmental reviews according to
the following procedures for each category.

Category A: Environmental reviews for Category A projects examine the potential
negative and positive environmental impact of projects. JBIC evaluates measures
necessary to prevent, minimize, mitigate or compensate for potential negative
impact, and measures to promote positive impact if any such measures are
available. Borrowers and related parties must submit Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) reports (see Section 2 of Part 2) for Category A projects. For
projects that will result in large-scale involuntary resettlement, basic
resettlement plans must be submitted. JBIC undertakes its environmental reviews
based on the EIA and other reports prepared by the project proponents and
submitted through the borrower.

Category B: The scope of environmental reviews for Category B projects may vary
from project to project, but it is narrower than that for Category A projects.
The environmental reviews for Category B are similar to that of category A in
that they examine potential negative and positive environmental impact and
evaluate measures necessary to prevent, minimize, mitigate or compensate for the
potential negative impact, and measures to promote positive impact if any such
measures are available. JBIC undertakes its environmental reviews based on
information provided by borrowers and related parties. Where an EIA procedure
has been conducted, the EIA report may be referred to, but this is not a
mandatory requirement.

Category C: For projects in this category, environmental reviews will not
proceed beyond screening.

Category FI: JBIC checks through the financial intermediary etc. to see whether
appropriate environmental and social considerations as stated in the Guidelines
are ensured for projects in this category.

The corresponding environmental checklists for each sector will be referred to
in conducting the aforementioned reviews.

(4) Monitoring

JBIC in principle confirms through the borrower over a certain period of time,
the results of monitoring the items which have a significant environmental
impact by the project proponents. This is in order to confirm the project
proponents' undertaking of environmental and social considerations for category
A and B projects.

The information necessary for monitoring by JBIC needs to be supplied by the
borrowers and related parties by appropriate means. When necessary, JBIC may
also conduct its own investigations. When third parties point out in concrete
terms that environmental and social considerations are not being fully
undertaken, JBIC forwards such claims to the borrowers and, if necessary,
encourages them to request the project proponents to take appropriate action. In
the project proponents' response


                                       5

<PAGE>

to the claim, JBIC confirms that they carry out the investigation of the
specific claim, the examination of countermeasures, and their incorporation into
the project plans through transparent and accountable processes.

Also, when necessary, JBIC may request the cooperation of the borrowers and
related parties in conducting its own investigations to confirm the state of
undertaking of environmental and social considerations.

If JBIC judges that there is a need for improvement in the situation with
respect to environmental and social considerations, it may ask the project
proponent, through the borrower, to take appropriate action in accordance with
the loan agreement. If the response of the project proponent is inappropriate,
JBIC may consider taking its own actions in accordance with the loan agreement,
including the suspension of the disbursement.

5. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION REGARDING CONFIRMATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL
CONSIDERATIONS BY JBIC

(1) Basic Principles

JBIC welcomes information provided by concerned organizations and stakeholders,
so that it may consider a diverse range of opinions and information in its
environmental reviews and supervision of projects. In order to encourage
concerned organizations and stakeholders to provide information to JBIC at an
early stage and to ensure its accountability and transparency in the
environmental review process, JBIC makes available, important information on
environmental reviews in ways appropriate to the nature of the project, while
the environmental review is in progress. JBIC may also, when necessary, seek the
opinions of concerned organizations and stakeholders.

In addition to the aforementioned principles, if requested by third parties,
JBIC will provide them with information regarding environmental and social
considerations within its capacity to do so.

JBIC respects the confidentiality of the commercial and other matters of the
borrowers and related parties, and observes concurrently the principles of
information disclosure and such confidentiality.

(2) Timing of Disclosure and Content of Disclosed Information

Prior to making decisions on funding and depending on the nature of the project,
JBIC discloses information in principle at the timing and with the contents
listed below. JBIC endeavors to disclose information in a manner that allows
enough time before decisions are made on funding:

     -    Upon completion of the screening of a project, JBIC discloses, as soon
          as possible, the project name, country, location, an outline and
          sector of the project, and its category classification, as well as the
          reasons for that classification; and

     -    For Category A and Category B projects, JBIC publishes the status of
          major documents on environmental and social considerations by the
          borrowers and related parties, such as EIA reports and environmental
          permit certificates, etc. issued by the host government on the JBIC
          website, and promptly makes available the EIA reports etc.

After executing a loan agreement, JBIC provides the results of its environmental
reviews of projects in Categories A, B and FI for public perusal on the JBIC
website.

JBIC pays due consideration to the confidentiality of the commercial and other
matters of the borrowers and related parties, taking into account their
competitive relationships, and encourages


                                       6

<PAGE>

them to exclude such confidential information from any documents on
environmental considerations submitted by them that may later be subject to
public disclosure. Any information that is prohibited from public disclosure in
the agreement between JBIC and the borrower may be disclosed only with either
the agreement of the borrowers and related parties or in accordance with legal
requirements.

6. TAKING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS INTO ACCOUNT FOR DECISION-MAKING AND LOAN
AGREEMENTS

JBIC takes the results of environmental reviews into account for its
decision-making on funding. If JBIC considers that a project is likely to have
an adverse impact on the environment due to inappropriate environmental and
social considerations, it will encourage, through the borrower the project
proponent to undertake appropriate environmental and social considerations. If
appropriate environmental and social considerations are not undertaken, JBIC may
decide not to extend funding.

JBIC will make its utmost effort to ensure that the following requirements are
met through loan agreements or their attached documents, when it is considered
necessary to ensure the enforcement of environmental and social considerations
by borrowers and related parties:

     -    The borrower is to report to JBIC on measures and monitoring related
          to environmental and social considerations undertaken by the project
          proponents. If, due to unforeseen circumstances, there is a
          possibility that the requirements for environmental and social
          consideration may not be fulfilled, the borrower is to report this to
          JBIC;

     -    If any problems regarding environmental and social considerations
          arise, the borrower is to make efforts for discussions to be held
          between the project proponents and project stakeholders;

     -    When project proponents and the host governments (including local
          governments) other than the borrower have important roles to play in
          terms of environmental and social considerations, the borrower is to
          endeavor to enter into agreements with these arties as well; and

     -    If it becomes evident that the borrower and the project proponents
          have not met the conditions required by JBIC under the Guidelines, or
          if it becomes apparent that the project will have an adverse impact on
          the environment after funding is extended, due to the borrower's or
          related parties' failure to supply correct information during the
          environmental review process, JBIC may, in accordance with the loan
          agreement, suspend the disbursement or declare all the principal
          outstanding at the time, with interest and any other charges thereon,
          to be payable immediately.

7. ENSURING APPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION OF AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES

JBIC endeavors to ensure appropriate implementation of the policies and
procedures stated in the Guidelines and compliance with the Guidelines. In order
to ensure its compliance with the Guidelines, JBIC accepts objections regarding
its non-compliance with the Guidelines and takes the necessary actions.

8. IMPLEMENTATION AND REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINES

JBIC verifies the status of the implementation of the Guidelines, and, based on
its findings, conducts a comprehensive review of the Guidelines within five (5)
years of their enforcement. Revisions may then be made as needed. When making
revisions, JBIC will seek the opinions of the Japanese Government, the
governments of developing countries, Japanese companies, experts, NGOs etc.,


                                       7

<PAGE>

while maintaining transparency in the process.

These Guidelines will come into force from October 1, 2003. The "Environmental
Guidelines for JBIC International Financial Operations" and "JBIC Environmental
Guidelines for ODA Loans" will apply to projects for which loan applications
have essentially been made before the enactment of these Guidelines.

N.B.: If there is any ambiguity in English version and/or any inconsistency with
Japanese version, the Japanese version prevails.

PART 2.

1. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL CONSIDERATIONS REQUIRED FOR FUNDED PROJECTS

In principle, appropriate environmental and social considerations are
undertaken, according to the nature of the project, based on the following:

(Underlying Principles)

-    Environmental impact which may be caused by a project must be assessed and
     examined from the earliest planning stage possible. Alternative proposals
     or minimization measures to prevent or reduce adverse impact must be
     examined and incorporated into the project plan:

-    Such examination must include analysis of environmental costs and benefits
     in as quantitative terms as possible and be conducted in close harmony with
     economic, financial, institutional, social and technical analysis of the
     project;

-    The findings of the examination of environmental and social considerations
     must include alternative proposals, mitigation measures and be recorded as
     separate documents or as a part of other documents. Environmental Impact
     Assessment (EIA) reports must be produced for projects in which there is a
     reasonable expectation of particularly large adverse environmental impact;
     and

-    For projects that have particularly large potential adverse impact or are
     highly contentious, a committee of experts may be formed to seek their
     opinions, in order to increase accountability.

(Examination of Measures)

-    Multiple alternative proposals must be examined to prevent or minimize
     adverse impact and to choose a better project option in terms of
     environmental and social considerations. In examination of measures,
     priority is to be given to the prevention of environmental impact, and when
     this is not possible, minimization and reduction of impact must be
     considered next. Compensation measures must be examined only when impact
     cannot be prevented by any of the aforementioned measures; and

-    Appropriate follow-up plans and systems, such as monitoring plans and
     environmental management plans, must be prepared; and costs of implementing
     such plans and systems, and financial methods to fund such costs, must be
     determined. Plans for projects with particularly large potential adverse
     impact must be accompanied by detailed environmental management plans.

(Scope of Impact to be Examined)

-    Environmental impact to be investigated and examined includes factors that
     impact human health and safety as well as the natural environment, such as:
     air, water, soil, waste, accidents, water usage, ecosystems, and biota.
     Social concerns include: involuntary resettlement of the population, the
     indigenous people, cultural heritage, landscape, gender, children's rights
     and communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and impact that may lead to
     trans-boundary and global environmental problems; and


                                       9

<PAGE>

-    In addition to the direct and immediate impact of projects, derivative,
     secondary and cumulative impact are also to be examined and investigated to
     a reasonable extent. It is also desirable that the impact which can occur
     at any time during the duration of the project be continuously considered
     throughout the life cycle of the project.

(Compliance with Laws, Standards and Plans)

-    Projects must comply with laws, ordinances and standards relating to
     environmental and social considerations established by the governments that
     have jurisdiction over the project site (including both national and local
     governments). They are also to conform to environmental and social
     consideration policies and plans of the governments that have jurisdiction
     over the project site; and

-    Projects must, in principle, be undertaken outside protected areas that are
     specifically designated by laws or ordinances of the government for the
     conservation of nature or cultural heritage (excluding projects whose
     primary objectives are to promote the protection or restoration of such
     designated areas). Projects are also not to impose significant adverse
     impact on designated conservation areas.

(Social Acceptability and Social Impacts)

Project must be adequately coordinated so that they are accepted in a manner
that is socially appropriate to the country and locality in which the project is
planned. For projects with a potentially large environmental impact, sufficient
consultations with stakeholders, such as local residents, must be conducted via
disclosure of information from an early stage where alternative proposals for
the project plans may be examined. The outcome of such consultations must be
incorporated into the contents of the project plan; and

-    Appropriate consideration must be given to vulnerable social groups, such
     as women, children, the elderly, the poor and ethnic minorities, all of
     whom are susceptible to environmental and social impact and who may have
     little access to the decision-making process within society.

(Involuntary Resettlement)

-    Involuntary resettlement and loss of means of livelihood are to be avoided
     where feasible, exploring all viable alternatives. When, after such
     examination, it is proved unfeasible, effective measures to minimize impact
     and to compensate for losses must be agreed upon with the people who will
     be affected;

-    People to be resettled involuntarily and people whose means of livelihood
     will be hindered or lost must be sufficiently compensated and supported by
     the project proponents, etc. in timely manner. The project proponents, etc.
     must make efforts to enable the people affected by the project, to improve
     their standard of living, income opportunities and production levels, or at
     least to restore them to pre-project levels. Measures to achieve this may
     include: providing land and monetary compensation for losses (to cover land
     and property losses), supporting the means for an alternative sustainable
     livelihood, and providing the expenses necessary for relocation and the
     re-establishment of a community at relocation sites; and

-    Appropriate participation by the people affected and their communities must
     be promoted in planning, implementation and monitoring of involuntary
     resettlement plans and measures against the loss of their means of
     livelihood.


                                       10

<PAGE>

(Indigenous Peoples)

-    When a project may have adverse impact on indigenous peoples, all of their
     rights in relation to land and resources must be respected in accordance
     with the spirit of the relevant international declarations and treaties.
     Efforts must be made to obtain the consent of indigenous peoples after they
     have been fully informed.

(Monitoring)

-    It is desirable that, after a project begins, the project proponents
     monitor: (i) whether any situations that were unforeseeable before the
     project began have arisen, (ii) the implementation situation and the
     effectiveness of the mitigation measures prepared in advance, and that they
     then take appropriate measures based on the results of such monitoring;

-    In cases where sufficient monitoring is deemed essential for the
     achievement of appropriate environmental and social considerations, such as
     the projects for which mitigation measures should be implemented while
     monitoring their effectiveness, project proponents must ensure that project
     plans include monitoring plans which are feasible;

-    It is desirable that project proponents make the results of the monitoring
     process available to project stakeholders; and

-    When third parties point out, in concrete terms, that environmental and
     social considerations are not being fully undertaken, it is desirable that
     a forum for discussion and examination of countermeasures be established
     based on sufficient information disclosure and include the participation of
     stakeholders in the relevant project. It is also desirable that an
     agreement be reached on procedures to be adopted with a view to resolving
     the problem.

2. EIA REPORTS FOR CATEGORY A PROJECTS

The following conditions are met in principle:

-    When assessment procedures already exist in host countries, and projects
     are subject to such procedures, borrowers and related parties must
     officially complete those procedures and obtain the approval of the
     government of the host country;

-    EIA reports (which may be referred to differently in different systems)
     must be written in the official language or a language widely used in the
     country where the project is to be implemented. When explaining projects to
     local residents, written materials must be provided in a language and form
     understandable to them;

-    EIA reports are required to be made available in the country and to the
     local residents where the project is to be implemented. The EIA reports are
     required to be available at all times for perusal by project stakeholders
     such as local residents and that copying be permitted;

-    In preparing EIA reports, consultation with stakeholders, such as local
     residents, must take place after sufficient information has been disclosed.
     Records, etc. of such consultations must be prepared;

-    Consultations with relevant stakeholders, such as local residents, should
     take place if necessary throughout the preparation and implementation
     stages of a project. Having consultations is


                                       11

<PAGE>

     highly desirable, especially when the items to be considered in the EIA are
     being selected, and when the draft report is being prepared; and

-    It is desirable that EIA reports cover the items enumerated in the Appendix
     hereto.

2. APPENDIX

     ILLUSTRATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT FOR CATEGORY A PROJECTS
     NB

An EIA's scope and level of detail should be decided in accordance with the
project's potential impacts. The EIA report should include the following items
(not necessarily in the order shown):

-    Executive Summary: concisely discusses significant findings and recommended
     actions.

-    Policy, legal and administrative framework: discusses the policy, legal and
     administrative framework within which the EIA report is to be carried out.

-    Project description: describes the proposed project and its geographic,
     ecological, social and temporal context, including any off-site investments
     that may be required (e.g. dedicated pipelines, access roads, power plants,
     water supply, housing, and raw material and product storage facilities).
     Indicates the need for any resettlement or social development plan.
     Normally includes a map showing the project site and the area affected by
     the project.

-    Baseline data: assesses the dimensions of the study area and describes
     relevant physical, biological and socio-economic conditions, including all
     changes anticipated before the project commences. Additionally, takes into
     account current and proposed development activities within the project area
     but not directly connected to the project. Data should be relevant to
     decisions about project site, design, operation, or mitigatory measures;
     the section indicates accuracy, reliability and sources of the data.

-    Environmental Impacts: predicts and assesses the project's likely positive
     and negative impacts, in quantitative terms to the extent possible.
     Identifies mitigation measures and any negative environmental impacts that
     cannot be mitigated. Explores opportunities for environmental enhancement.
     Identifies and estimates the extent and quality of available data,
     essential data gaps and uncertainties associated with predictions, and
     specifies topics that do not require further attention.

-    Analysis of alternatives: systematically compares feasible alternatives to
     the proposed project site, technology, design and operation including the
     "without project" situation in terms of their potential environmental
     impacts; the feasibility of mitigating these impacts; their capital and
     recurrent costs; their suitability under local conditions; and their
     institutional, training and monitoring requirements. For each of the
     alternatives, quantifies the environmental impacts to the extent possible,
     and attaches economic values where feasible. States the basis for selecting
     the particular project design proposed and offers justification for
     recommended emission levels and approaches to pollution prevention and
     abatement.

-    Environmental Management Plan (EMP): describes mitigation, monitoring and
     institutional measures to be taken during construction and operation to
     eliminate adverse impacts, offset them, or reduce them to acceptable
     levels.

     KfW LOAN AGREEMENT dated as of September 30, 2005 (this "Agreement")
between SOCIEDAD MINERA CERRO VERDE S.A.A., a sociedad anonima abierta organized
under the laws of Peru (the "Borrower"), and KfW, a corporation under the public
law of the Federal Republic of Germany ("KfW").

     KfW is majority-owned by the German government and in accordance with its
Bylaws and institutional objectives, KfW has agreed to grant a credit facility
to the Borrower for purposes of developing and promoting mining activities in
Peru.

     For purposes of financing in part the development by the Borrower of the
Sulfide Project (referred to in the Master Participation Agreement referred to
below), the Borrower is entering into various loan and credit agreements,
including this Agreement, setting out the terms upon which financing is to be
provided for such development. In conjunction therewith, the Borrower, KfW,
JBIC, the Lead JBIC Arrangers, the Commercial Banks and the Administrative Agent
are entering into a master participation agreement (the "Master Participation
Agreement"), containing certain representations, covenants, undertakings and
security for the common benefit of the Senior Facility Lenders providing the
Senior Facility Loans (as defined in the Master Participation Agreement). Also
in connection therewith, the Parent Companies shall enter into a transfer
restrictions agreement (the Transfer Restrictions Agreement referred to in the
Master Participation Agreement), for the common benefit of such Senior Facility
Lenders, and the Parent Companies shall enter into a Completion Guarantee (the
Completion Guarantee referred to in the Master Participation Agreement)
guaranteeing the payment of the Senior Loan Obligations until Completion and
containing undertakings regarding Completion of the Sulfide Project. Based on
the foregoing, KfW is prepared, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and in the other Financing Documents, to make Loans to the Borrower
that constitute Loans in an aggregate principal amount up to US$22,500,000 for
the purchase of equipment and services delivered by the Exporter under the
Export Contracts in connection with the development of the Sulfide Project.

     Accordingly, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

conditions of the Loans, provided that the exercise of enforcement remedies

                                    THE LOANS

          2.01 Loans. KfW agrees, upon the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Master Participation Agreement, to make Loans to the Borrower
from time to time in such aggregate principal amount not exceeding its Aggregate
Committed Amount, and on such Business Days during the period from the date
hereof to but excluding the Availability Period End Date as the Borrower shall
request pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof. KfW's Aggregate Committed Amount shall
be utilized for the following purposes: (i) an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed approximately US$20,670,300 to finance or reimburse the Borrower for
expenses incurred in connection with up to 85% of the German Supply Portion and
(ii) an aggregate amount not to exceed approximately US$1,829,700 to finance or
reimburse the Borrower for expenses incurred in connection with up to 100% of
the Facility Fee, collectively not to exceed, in any event, US$22,500,000 in the
aggregate.

     The Loans may be borrowed as Fixed Rate Loans or as Floating Rate Loans.
Floating Rate Loans may be converted into Fixed Rate Loans as provided in
Section 2.04 hereof.

     The Loans shall be advanced from time to time, but in no event more
frequently than once per calendar month, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and the Master Participation Agreement. Any amounts borrowed and paid
or prepaid pursuant to the terms herein may not be reborrowed by the Borrower.

     The Borrower shall not be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement
to pay all amounts due and payable on the relevant due date by reason of the KfW
Loans being insufficient to finance up to 100% of the Facility Fee under this
Agreement.

          2.02 Manner of Borrowing. The Borrower shall give KfW not less than
fifteen (15) Business Days' prior notice (which notice shall be copied to the
Trustee and the Administrative Agent and shall be irrevocable and effective upon
receipt) specifying the date and amount of each borrowing hereunder, such notice
to be substantially in the form of Exhibit C and specifying whether the Borrower
requests a Floating Rate Loan or a Fixed Rate Loan. Except as to the borrowing
which utilizes the unborrowed portion of the Commitment in full, each borrowing
of Loans shall be in a minimum amount of US$500,000. No more than one borrowing
may be requested in any calendar month. The proceeds of each Loan shall be made
available directly to the Borrower by KfW in Dollars, on the respective
borrowing date, by credit to the Onshore Dollars Account, thus reimbursing the
Borrower for payments already made

                               KfW Loan Agreement

                                      -5-


under the respective Export Contract, provided that the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 9.01 have been met.

          2.03 Certain Notices. The Borrower shall notify KfW in writing (which
notice shall be irrevocable and effective upon receipt), at least five (5)
Frankfurt Business Days prior to the end of an Interest Period for any Floating
Rate Loan, if the Borrower wishes to convert such Loan into a Fixed Rate Loan
pursuant to Section 2.04 hereof.

          2.04 Conversions into Fixed Rate Loans. The Borrower shall have the
right to convert Floating Rate Loans into Fixed Rate Loans; provided that (a)
the Borrower shall give KfW notice of each such conversion pursuant to Section
2.03 hereof; (b) each such conversion shall be in a minimum amount of
US$500,000, provided, however, that the Borrower may convert any Floating Rate
Loans outstanding as of the Availability Period End Date in an amount less than
US$500,000; and (c) a Floating Rate Loan may be so converted only on the last
day of an Interest Period for such Loan. Upon conversion of Floating Rate Loans
to Fixed Rate Loans all subsequent disbursements shall be made as Fixed Rate
Loans. For the avoidance of doubt, once the Borrower shall have converted
Floating Rate Loans to Fixed Rate Loans, the Borrower shall not be permitted to
revert any such Loans back to Floating Rate Loans.

          2.05 Reduction in Commitment. The Borrower shall have the right to
terminate or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Commitment subject to and
in accordance with Section 2.03 of the Master Participation Agreement.

          2.06 Availability Period. The facility will be available from the date
on which the conditions precedent set forth in Section 5.01 of the Master
Participation Agreement are fulfilled through the Availability Period End Date.

                                   ARTICLE III

                    PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND PROMISSORY NOTES

          3.01 Principal. The Borrower agrees to repay the principal amount of
each Loan in 16 consecutive semi-annual installments on each Payment Date,
commencing on the first Payment Date in accordance with the Amortization
Schedule set forth in Exhibit A; provided, however, that the amount of the final
payment of principal of the Loans shall in any event be equal to the remaining
unpaid principal amount of the Loans.

          3.02 Interest. The Borrower agrees to pay KfW interest on the
Outstanding Base Amount of each Loan for the period from and including the date
of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at the
following rates per annum:

          (a) during such periods as such Loan is a Floating Rate Loan, for each
     Interest Period relating thereto, the Applicable Base Rate for such
     Floating Rate Loan for such Interest Period plus the applicable Margin
     plus, upon the occurrence and during the Continuance of any MPA Event of
     Default under Section 9.01 of the Master Participation Agreement, the
     Default Margin; and

          (b) during such periods as such Loan is a Fixed Rate Loan, for each
     Fixed Rate Period relating thereto, the Applicable Base Rate for such Fixed
     Rate Loan for such

                               KfW Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -6-


     Fixed Rate Period plus the applicable Margin plus, upon the occurrence and
     during the Continuance of any MPA Event of Default under Section 9.01 of
     the Master Participation Agreement, the Default Margin.

Interest shall accrue (i) in the case of a Fixed Rate Loan, from and including
the date of such Loan in case of the first interest payment with respect to any
Advance or from and including the Interest Payment Date to which interest has
been paid in case of the second and any subsequent interest payments with
respect to each Advance to but excluding the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date or, in the case of payment pursuant to clause (B) below, to but excluding
the date of such payment, and (ii) in the case of a Floating Rate Loan, from and
including the first day of each Interest Period for such Loan to but excluding
the last day of such Interest Period or, in the case of payment pursuant to
clause (B) or (C) below, to but excluding the date of such payment. Accrued
interest on each Loan shall be payable (A) on each Interest Payment Date; (B)
upon the payment or prepayment thereof (on the principal amount so paid or
prepaid); and (C) in the case of a Floating Rate Loan, upon the conversion of
such Loan to a Fixed Rate Loan (on the principal amount so converted). Each
Interest Period for a Floating Rate Loan shall (y) comply with the definition of
the term "Interest Period" and (z) except for the first Interest Period for a
Floating Rate Loan, will have a duration of six months.

          3.03 Post-Default Interest. If any installment of principal of any
Loan or any other amount (including interest on a Loan) payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid in full when due (whether at the stated due date, by
acceleration or otherwise), the Borrower hereby agrees to pay from time to time
upon KfW's demand interest on the amount past due and unpaid for such period of
time within each related Default Interest Period during which such amount shall
be due and unpaid, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (a) the Margin plus
(b) the Default Margin plus (c) (i) in the case of Fixed Rate Loan, during a
Fixed Rate Period therefor, the Applicable Base Rate therefor, and (ii) in all
other cases, the Applicable Base Rate for Floating Rate Loans for such Default
Interest Period.

          3.04 Promissory Notes.

     (a) As additional evidence of the Borrower's obligation to pay the
principal of the Loans as provided in Section 3.01 hereof, the Borrower shall
execute and deliver to the Trustee on behalf of KfW Promissory Notes issued by
the Borrower, in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit B hereto, with a
dual column translation into Spanish to be included therein, in accordance with
Section 2.08 of the Master Participation Agreement.

     (b) The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Promissory Notes
shall not affect in any way whatsoever the rights or obligations of the Borrower
under this Agreement, and the rights and claims of KfW under the Promissory
Notes held by it shall not replace or supersede the rights and claims of KfW
hereunder, provided that payment of any part of the principal of any such
Promissory Note in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall, to the
extent that such payment if made hereunder would discharge the Borrower's
obligations hereunder in respect of the payment of the principal of the Loan
evidenced by such Promissory Note, discharge such obligation pro tanto and the
payment of any principal of a Loan in accordance with the terms and conditions
hereof shall discharge the obligations of the Borrower under the Promissory Note
evidencing such Loan to the extent of such payment.

                                      -7-


          3.05 Selection of Fixed Rates. Not more than 15 and not less than
seven Business Days prior to a proposed borrowing of a Loan hereunder or prior
to the last day of an Interest Period for any Floating Rate Loan, the Borrower
may request that KfW advise the Borrower on an indicative basis (which shall not
be binding) of KfW's best estimate of what the expected Applicable Base Rate
would be for a Fixed Rate Loan with a Fixed Rate Period commencing on the date
of borrowing of the proposed Loan or on the last day of such Interest Period, as
the case may be, and ending on the Final Maturity Date; provided, however, that
any change in such Applicable Base Rate from that so advised by KfW shall result
only from a change in KfW's funding costs.

          3.06 Consolidation of Applicable Base Rate for Fixed Rate Loans. In
the event that more than one Fixed Rate Loan is outstanding, KfW may in its own
discretion consolidate the Applicable Base Rates for Fixed Rate Loans
outstanding on such date into a single interest rate corresponding to the
weighted average of the Applicable Base Rates for such Fixed Rate Loans, rounded
down to 1/10,000 if the fifth decimal to be omitted is below 5 or rounded up to
1/10,000 if the fifth decimal to be omitted is 5 or above. Commencing with the
first Payment Date following such consolidation, such weighted average interest
rate shall constitute the Applicable Base Rate for the further computation and
payment of interest for such consolidated Fixed Rate Loans.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                   COMMISSIONS

          4.01 Commitment Commission. The Borrower agrees to pay KfW a
commitment commission on the daily unborrowed amount of the Commitment which may
be reduced or terminated as contemplated in Section 2.03 of the Master
Participation Agreement for the period from and including the date of this
Agreement to but excluding the earliest of (a) the date the Commitment is
borrowed in full, (b) the date the Commitment is terminated and (c) the
Availability Period End Date, at a rate per annum equal to 0.25%. Accrued
commitment commission under this Section 4.01 shall be payable quarterly, in
arrears, on each Interest Payment Date and on each date falling three calendar
months after each such Interest Payment Date, with the last installment of the
commitment commission hereunder to be paid on the Availability Period End Date.

          4.02 Loan Management Commission. The Borrower shall pay to KfW an
upfront fee equal to 1% of the Commitment (determined as of the date of this
Agreement) payable within 30 days from and after the date of this Agreement.

          4.03 Facility Fee. On the date of disbursement of the initial Advance,
the Borrower agrees to pay a facility fee (the "Facility Fee") in such amount as
KfW shall determine is necessary to compensate it for costs and expenses
associated with the HERMES Guarantee. The Facility Fee as determined by KfW
shall be binding on the Borrower. If the Facility Fee or a portion thereof is
refunded to KfW by HERMES, KfW shall reimburse the Borrower in an amount equal
to the amount refunded to KfW by HERMES promptly upon receipt of such refund
from HERMES. If the Facility Fee exceeds the amount set forth in Section 2.01,
the Borrower shall pay the full amount of the Facility Fee (including such
excess) to KfW in accordance with this Section 4.03.

Agreement and the generally applicable procedures of KfW in respect of
confidential commercial information, KfW shall be entitled to give information
relating to the Sulfide Project and to the KfW Loan Agreement to representatives
of the Federal Republic of Germany having any responsibility in connection with
the HERMES Guarantee and its representatives and advisors. Furthermore, subject
to Section 12.10 of the Master Participation Agreement and the generally
applicable procedures of KfW in respect of confidential commercial information,
KfW and the representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be entitled
to give information relating to the KfW Loan Agreement to international
organizations entrusted with the collection of statistical data, particularly
data in connection with debt servicing.

          5.03 KfW's Right to Demand Information and Give Approval Regarding
Export Contracts. The Borrower shall inform KfW without delay of any event that,
in its reasonable judgment, could be reasonably expected to materially impede or
endanger the implementation of the Export Contracts according to schedule. The
Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of KfW (which may not be
unreasonably withheld), agree to any modification of or amendment to the Export
Contracts that (a) reduces the total price of the Export Contracts below
US$22,500,000 or (b) changes the Exporter under such Export Contracts. In
addition, the Borrower shall inform KfW without delay of its own accord of any
modification of or amendment to the Export Contracts that may materially affect
the volume of goods and services or any other material provision of the Export
Contracts. The Borrower shall on demand furnish any information reasonably
requested by KfW regarding the Export Contracts.

                                   PREPAYMENT

          6.01 Voluntary Prepayments.

     (a) The Borrower shall have the right to prepay the Loans, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty other than as required by Sections 6.01(b) and
Section 6.03 hereof, at any time or from time to time in accordance with Section
3.05 of the Master Participation Agreement; provided, however, that each
prepayment of a Fixed Rate Loan, and each prepayment of a Floating Rate Loan on
a date other than the last day of the then current Interest Period, shall be
accompanied by, and the Borrower hereby agrees to pay to KfW on the date of such
prepayment, payment of the prepayment compensation (if any) required under
Section 6.03 hereof and reimbursement of funding losses or expenses (if any)
required under Section 3.11 of the Master Participation Agreement. Partial
prepayment shall be applied to the Loans in accordance with Section 3.08 of the
Master Participation Agreement.

                                      -9-


     (b) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Borrower
makes a voluntary prepayment of all or any portion of the principal outstanding
amount of any Floating Rate Loan or Fixed Rate Loan at any time prior to the
Final Maturity Date with the proceeds of replacement debt obtained (either at
the time or within a period of one year from the date of such voluntary
prepayment) from a Person other than the Parent Companies or an Affiliate of the
Parent Companies, the Borrower shall, on the date that such replacement debt is
obtained, pay to KfW a prepayment fee equal to one-half of one per cent (0.5%)
of the aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Loans and Fixed Rate Loans
prepaid by the Borrower.

     (c) Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if KfW exercises
its rights to suspend, cancel or terminate its aggregate Committed Amount
pursuant to Section 12.03 (other than by reason of, directly or indirectly,
improper acts or inactions of the Borrower), then the Borrower may prepay all or
any portion of any Loan without prepayment premium or penalty of any kind
whatsoever.

          6.02 Pro Rata Prepayment. The extent to which payments or prepayments
by the Borrower to any Senior Lender in respect of the Senior Loan Obligations
must be a Pro Rata Payment shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.04
of the Master Participation Agreement. KfW may waive its right to receive any
such prepayment without prejudice to its right to receive any subsequent
prepayment. Each prepayment of Loans under this Section 6.02 shall be
accompanied by the prepayment compensation (if any) required under Section 6.03
hereof and amounts (if any) then payable under Section 3.11 of the Master
Participation Agreement.

          6.03 Prepayment Compensation for Fixed Rate Loans. Without duplication
of any compensation payable under Section 3.11 of the Master Participation
Agreement, upon any payment prior to scheduled maturity (whether pursuant to
this Article VI or Article XII hereof or otherwise) of any principal of any
Fixed Rate Loan, in whole or in part if (a) the sum of the interest payments
which (in the absence of such prepayment) would have been payable on each
installment of such Loan (or portion thereof) so prepaid, on each Payment Date
from the date of such prepayment to the original scheduled maturity date of such
installment, at the applicable rate for such Loan specified in Article III
hereof minus the applicable Margin (for purposes of this Section 6.03, the
"Prepayment Interest") exceeds (b) the sum of the interest payments which would
be received if the principal amount of each installment of such Loan (or portion
thereof) so prepaid were re-invested, for the period from the date of such
prepayment to the original scheduled maturity date hereunder of such
installment, at the Reinvestment Rate (as defined below) (for purposes of this
Section 6.03, the "Reinvestment Interest"), the Borrower agrees to pay KfW a
prepayment commission in respect of each such prepayment in an amount (computed
as of the date of such prepayment) equal to the Present Value (as defined below)
of the amount of such excess.

     For purposes of this Section 6.03, "Reinvestment Rate" shall mean, in
respect of each installment of principal prepaid, the rate which appears on the
Reuters Screen RTRTSY1 Page at or about 4:00 p.m. (Frankfurt time) on a date
selected by KfW occurring on or within five Eurodollar Business Days prior to
the date of such prepayment, for actively traded U.S. Treasury obligations
having substantially the same scheduled maturity as such installment
(interpolating, where appropriate, between the yield to maturity quotations for
the next shorter and next longer

                               KfW Loan Agreement

                                      -10-


maturities for any Loan installment scheduled to mature at a time for which no
such yield quotation is expressed); and the "Present Value" of any amount
receivable or deemed receivable on a specified future date shall mean such
amount discounted to present value (from such specified future date to the date
of such prepayment) at the Reinvestment Rate.

          6.04 Mandatory Prepayments. The Borrower shall make Mandatory
Prepayments as set forth in Section 3.06 of the Master Participation Agreement.
KfW may waive its right to receive any Mandatory Prepayments without prejudice
to its right to receive any subsequent Mandatory Prepayment. Each prepayment of
Loans under this Section 6.04 shall be accompanied by the prepayment
compensation (if any) required under Section 6.03 hereof and amounts (if any)
then payable under Section 3.11 of the Master Participation Agreement.

     In case of mandatory prepayments made in accordance with Section 3.06 of
the Master Participation Agreement, the Borrower shall, upon KfW's demand,
prepay the outstanding Loans in full (or in the amount of the affected portion
thereof) together with accrued interest thereon and all other amounts payable to
KfW hereunder (including amounts, if any, payable under Section 6.03 hereof and
Section 3.11 of the Master Participation Agreement), in the case of each
outstanding Floating Rate Loan, on the last day of the then current Interest
Period for such Floating Rate Loan and, in the case of each outstanding Fixed
Rate Loan, on the first Payment Date occurring at least three months after the
date of such demand (or, in the case of any Loan, on such earlier date as shall
be certified by KfW as being the last permissible date for such prepayment under
the relevant law, rule, regulation, treaty or directive).

                                   ARTICLE VII

                                    PAYMENTS

          7.01 Payments. All payments and prepayments on account of the
principal of and interest on the Loans, fees, commissions, indemnities and other
amounts payable under this Agreement or any Promissory Note by the Borrower
shall be made to KfW in Dollars and in immediately available funds, without
set-off, counterclaim or reduction for any reason whatsoever, by credit to an
account designated by KfW at Citibank in New York, New York (Swift Code: BIC
CITIUS33, Account number: 10926093, Account name: KfW) and designating KfW in
Frankfurt am Main, Germany as the beneficiary (Swift Code: KFWIDEE, Payment
Reference: yyyymmdd/Cerro Verde (8137091719), not later than 11:00 a.m. New York
City time on the date on which such payment shall become due.

          7.02 Non-Business Days. If any payment under this Agreement falls due
on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date therefor shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for any principal
so extended for the period of such extension.

          7.03 Computations. Interest hereunder calculated on the basis of the
quotations referred to in clause (a) and clause (b) of the definition of
"Applicable Base Rate" shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
actual days elapsed. Prepayment compensation under Section 6.04 hereof, shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days, as the case may be)
and actual days elapsed. Commitment commission hereunder shall be computed on
the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                               CERTAIN INDEMNITIES

          8.01 Increased Cost of Loans. In the event that, at any time or from
time to time, as a result of any change in any applicable laws (including the
adoption of any new laws), rules, regulations, treaties, directives or requests
of general applicability of any applicable governmental, fiscal or monetary
authority (whether imposing or modifying taxation (other than Excluded Taxes and
Indemnified Taxes, provision for which is made in Section 8.01 hereof), reserve
or special or other deposit requirements or any other requirements or
conditions, and whether or not having the force of law), or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any court or any such authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof (including, without
limitation, any change in the regulations implementing the proposals for a
risk-based capital framework described by the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulations and Supervisory Practices in its paper entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as
modified and supplemented), or by reason of KfW's compliance with any such law,
rule, regulation, treaty, directive or request, the cost to KfW of making,
maintaining or funding the Loans is increased, or any amount (or the effective
return on any amount) received or receivable by KfW hereunder or under the
Promissory Notes is reduced, or the rate of return to be earned by KfW with
respect to any Loan is reduced, or KfW is required to make any payment in
connection with any transactions contemplated hereby, by or in an amount
reasonably deemed by KfW to be material, then the Borrower will on demand by KfW
from time to time pay KfW such additional amount or amounts as (in the good
faith determination of KfW) are necessary to compensate KfW for such increased
cost, reduction or payment; provided that, KfW shall not be entitled to make any
claim for additional costs under this Section 8.01, to the extent any such
additional cost is attributable directly or indirectly to the application of,
compliance with or implementation of any part or "pillar" of the International
Convergence of Capital Measurement Standards: a Revised Framework, published by
the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision in June 2004 (as in effect on the
date hereof), or any implementation or interpretation thereof, whether by any
law or regulation, or otherwise, or to any change by KfW from one method of
calculating capital adequacy to another, insofar as such additional costs are
directly or indirectly attributable to credit-related events or circumstances
that are specific to KfW and not solely to general regulatory guidelines or
requirements imposed on the banking sector generally. Any such demand by KfW
shall be accompanied by a certificate from KfW stating the basis for its demand
and setting forth in reasonable detail the calculations of the amount thereof.

          8.02 Alternative Interest Rate. If, with respect to any Interest
Period for any Floating Rate Loan or with respect to any Default Interest
Period, KfW determines in its reasonable judgment that quotations of interest
rates of the types referred to in clause (a) in the definition of "Applicable
Base Rate" are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant
maturity for purposes of determining the "Applicable Base Rate" for such
Interest Period or Default Interest Period, KfW shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Borrower, and the following provisions shall apply:

          (a) During the thirty-day period following the date of any such notice
     (the "Negotiation Period"), KfW and the Borrower will negotiate in good
     faith for the purpose of agreeing upon an alternative, mutually acceptable
     basis (the "Substitute

                               KfW Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -12-


     Basis") for determining the rate of interest to be applicable to such Loan
     from time to time and if, at the expiration of the Negotiation Period, KfW
     and the Borrower have agreed upon a Substitute Basis and any required
     governmental approvals therefor have been obtained, the Substitute Basis
     shall take effect from such date (including, if agreed, such retroactive
     date) as KfW and the Borrower may in such circumstance agree.

          (b) If at the expiration of the Negotiation Period, a Substitute Basis
     shall not have been agreed upon or any required governmental approvals
     therefor shall not have been obtained, KfW shall notify the Borrower of the
     cost to KfW (as reasonably determined by it) of funding and maintaining the
     outstanding affected Loan for such Interest Period or Default Interest
     Period, and the interest payable to KfW on such Loan for such Interest
     Period or Default Interest Period shall be interest at a rate per annum
     equal to the cost of funding and maintaining such Loan as so notified by
     KfW plus the applicable Margin (and, as appropriate, the Default Margin).

The procedures specified in (a) and (b) above shall apply to each relevant
period succeeding the first such period to which they were applied unless and
until KfW notifies the Borrower that the condition referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 8.02 no longer exists (which notice KfW agrees to give
promptly following the cessation of such condition) or until each affected
Floating Rate Loan is converted into a Fixed Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.04
hereof, whereupon interest on such Loan shall again be determined in accordance
with the provisions of Section 3.02 hereof, effective commencing on the first
Payment Date next succeeding the date of such notice or (if a Fixed Rate Period
is so established) the first day of such Fixed Rate Period.

          8.03 Mitigation. If an event or circumstance occurs that would entitle
KfW to exercise any of the rights or benefits afforded by this Article VIII,
KfW, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, shall take such steps as may be
reasonably available to it to eliminate or mitigate the effects of such event or
circumstance; provided, however, that KfW shall not be under any obligation to
take any steps that, in its sole discretion, would (a) result in its incurring
additional costs or taxes or (b) otherwise be disadvantageous to KfW.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                              CONDITIONS OF LENDING

          9.01 Initial Loan. The obligation of KfW to make the initial Loan to

     relevant governmental or other authorities

     and all relevant fees and charges relating thereto which are then due and
     payable shall have been paid in full.

          (c) Export Contracts. The Export Contracts shall not have been
     cancelled, rescinded or terminated for reasons other than performance of
     their terms.

          (d) No modifications of Export Contracts. No modification of, or
     amendment to, the Export Contracts that will (i) reduce the total price of
     the Export Contracts below US$22,500,000 or (ii) change the Exporter under
     the Export Contracts, in each case without the prior consent of KfW.

          (e) Drawdown Certificate. Not less than 15 Business Days prior to the
     proposed date of borrowing, KfW shall have received a KfW Loan Agreement
     Drawdown Certificate in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit C

     Borrower and the Borrower shall have provided the Trustee and the
     Administrative Agent with a copy of such Drawdown Certificate.

          9.02 Additional Conditions. The obligation of KfW to make each Loan
(excluding the initial Loan which is subject to the conditions described in

     Borrower and the Borrower shall have provided the Trustee and the
     Administrative Agent with a copy of such Drawdown Certificate; and

          (c) HERMES Guarantee. The HERMES Guarantee shall not have been
     revoked, canceled, restricted or suspended, unless such revocation,
     cancellation, restriction or suspension was directly and proximately caused
     by (i) the failure of KfW to pay any applicable guarantee fee after the
     Borrower has paid to KfW all amounts demanded in respect thereof pursuant
     to Section 4.03 hereof when due or (ii) misrepresentations by KfW to HERMES
     unless such misrepresentations were based upon information supplied to KfW
     in writing by the Borrower or the Parent Companies.

                                    ARTICLE X

covenants and agrees with KfW that it shall use the loan proceeds solely in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.01 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

          13.01 No Waiver. No failure on the part of KfW to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power

          13.05 Assignments and Participations; Information.

     (a) The Borrower may not assign its rights or obligations hereunder or
under the Promissory Notes without the prior consent of KfW.

     (b) KfW may at any time transfer the Loans, the Promissory Notes and
Commitments to a wholly-owned subsidiary of KfW whose jurisdiction is Germany,
and in the event of such transfer all references herein to "KfW" shall be deemed
to such wholly-owned subsidiary.

     (c) KfW may at any time sell, assign, transfer, grant participations in, or
otherwise dispose of a portion of the Loans, the Promissory Notes or the
Commitment (collectively, "Transferred Interests") (i) to any other Person
subject to Section 12.13 of the Master Participation Agreement or (ii) if an MPA
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to HERMES or any agency,
instrumentality or political subdivision of Germany (for purposes of this
Section 13.05, collectively, "HERMES" and, together with any transferee in
accordance with clause (i) of this Section 13.05(c), "Transferees"). Upon the
execution and delivery by any Transferee to the Borrower of an instrument in
writing pursuant to which such Transferee agrees to assume the obligations of
KfW hereunder with respect to the Transferred Interest, such Transfer will be
effective and such Transferee may exercise all legal and equitable rights and
remedies, and shall be entitled to the benefits of Article VII hereof, as if
such Transferee were a lender hereunder holding a "Loan" in the amount of the
Transferred Interest held by it.

     (d) KfW may furnish any information concerning the Borrower in the
possession of KfW from time to time to Transferees (including prospective

Agreement is legally independent of all Export Contracts. In connection with the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Borrower may in no
event raise objections on the basis of the Export Contracts for which the
financing is in part provided or any other contract providing for the export of
goods or services.

          13.06 Amendments, Etc. Subject to Article X of the Master
Participation Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement may not be amended,
modified or waived except by an instrument or instruments in writing or by
facsimile transmission signed by the Borrower and KfW.

          13.07 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument, and either of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by

the essence, and Dollars shall be the currency of account in all events. The
obligations of the Borrower to make payments hereunder shall not be discharged
by an amount paid in any currency other than Dollars, whether pursuant to a
court or arbitral judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid
upon conversion to Dollars and transferred to New York, New York under normal
banking procedures does not yield the amount of Dollars due, and the Borrower
hereby, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, agrees
to indemnify the Trustee, the Appointed Parties' Agents and each Senior Facility
Lender against, and to pay to the Trustee, the Appointed Parties' Agents and
each Senior Facility Lender on demand, in Dollars, any difference between the
sum originally due in Dollars and the amount of Dollars received upon any such

credit to an account designated by the Holder at Citibank in New York, New York

Code: KFWIDEE, Payment Reference: yyyymmdd/Cerro Verde (8137091719), not later

any obligation hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction
or withholding for or on account of, any and all present or future Taxes
(excluding (i) Taxes imposed on or measured by the net income, profits, or
capital of the Holder by the jurisdiction under the laws of which the Holder was
incorporated or organized, (ii) Taxes which would not have been imposed on the
Holder but for a change by the Holder of its lending office, (iii) Taxes which
would not have been imposed on a Holder but for the transfer by the Holder of an
interest herein or (iv) Taxes which would not have been imposed on a Holder but
for such Holder's having a place of business in the jurisdiction imposing the
Tax (other than a place of business arising from the transaction contemplated
hereby or from having executed, delivered, performed its obligations or received
a payment hereunder, or enforced its rights hereunder)), Taxes described in the
immediately preceding clauses (i) through (iv) being referred to herein as the
"Excluded Taxes" and Taxes other than the Excluded Taxes being referred to
herein as "Indemnified Taxes", now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority of the Republic of Peru,
unless such deduction or withholding is required by an applicable Government
Rule, in which case the following paragraph shall apply.

     If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Indemnified Taxes
now or hereafter imposed, levied or collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority of the Republic of Peru from or in respect of any sum
payable hereunder, the Borrower shall, at its option, either (i) pay to the
Holder in respect of which such deduction or withholding is required to be made,
such additional amount (the "Additional Tax Amount") as may be necessary so that
after all required deductions and withholdings (including, without limitation,
deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this
paragraph), the Holder receives on the due date thereof an amount equal to the
sum it would have received, had no such deduction or withholding been made, or
(ii) assume the payment of the Indemnified Tax and pay directly the full amount
to the tax administration when due in accordance with Article 47 of the Peruvian
Income Tax Act, so that the amount paid to the Holder equals the amount it would
have received if the Borrower had not been required by law to deduct such
Indemnified Tax.

     The Borrower agrees to pay or reimburse upon demand in like manner and
funds, any and all documented costs and expenses of the Holder hereof or of the
Collateral Agent with respect to the enforcement of this Promissory Note.

Agreement, which has originated this Promissory Note, all procedural matters or

Spanish speaking jurisdiction is the jurisdiction elected by the Holder, and
(ii) the English version shall prevail when the Federal or State court located
in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York or any other non-Spanish

the Borrower at any time hereunder and under the Promissory Notes to each Lender
shall be separate and independent obligations of the Borrower and each Lender
shall be entitled, in accordance with the Master Participation Agreement, to
protect and enforce its rights arising out of this Agreement and the Promissory
Notes held by it, and, except as otherwise provided in the Master Participation
Agreement, it shall not be necessary for any other Lender or the Administrative
Agent to consent to, or be joined as an additional party in, any proceedings for
such purposes.

          2.07 Promissory Notes. As additional evidence of the Borrower's
obligation to pay the principal of the Loans as provided herein, the Borrower
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent on behalf of each Lender,
Promissory Notes issued by the Borrower, in substantially the form set forth in
Exhibit A hereto, with a dual column translation into Spanish to be included
therein, in accordance with Section 2.08 of the Master Participation Agreement.

          2.08 Voluntary Prepayments of Loans. The Borrower shall have the right
to prepay Loans, either in whole or in part, in accordance with Section 3.05 of
the Master Participation Agreement, at any time or from time to time. Each
prepayment of Loans under this Section 2.08 shall be accompanied by the
prepayment compensation (if any) required under Section 3.11 of the Master
Participation Agreement. Any prepayment made by the Borrower pursuant to
Sections 2.08, 2.09 and 2.11 shall be made together with all accrued but unpaid
interest on amounts prepaid and all other amounts (including any amounts due
pursuant to Section 5) then due from the Borrower hereunder. Partial prepayment
shall be applied to the Loans in accordance with Section 3.08 of the Master
Participation Agreement.

          2.09 Pro Rata Prepayments. The extent to which prepayments by the
Borrower to any Senior Lender in respect of the Senior Loan Obligations must be
a Pro Rata Payment shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.04 of the
Master Participation Agreement. A Lender may waive its right to receive any such
prepayment without prejudice to its right to receive any subsequent prepayment.
Each prepayment of Loans shall be accompanied by the prepayment compensation (if
any) required under Section 3.11 of the Master Participation Agreement and shall
be applied in accordance with the Master Participation Agreement. Amounts
prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.09 may not be reborrowed by the Borrower.

          2.10 Change in Commitments.

     (a) Commitments Generally. The Borrower shall have the right to terminate
or reduce the aggregate unused amount of the Commitment subject to and in

aggregate unutilized amount of Tranche B Commitments outstanding on such date in
an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the aggregate amount of the Peruvian Bonds
issuance and (ii) the aggregate unutilized amount of Tranche B Commitments
outstanding on such date. To the extent that the aggregate proceeds of issuance
of the Peruvian Bonds on such date exceeds the aggregate unutilized amount of
Tranche B Commitments outstanding on such date, the Borrower shall prepay the
Tranche B Loans outstanding (together with interest accrued and payable thereon)
in an amount equal to the difference between (x) the aggregate proceeds of
issuance of the Peruvian Bonds on such date and (y) the aggregate unutilized
amount of Tranche B Commitments outstanding on such date.

     (c) No Reinstatement. Any portion of the Commitments once terminated or
reduced may not be reinstated.

Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, the principal amount of
the Loans in consecutive semi-annual installments payable commencing on the
first Payment Date and on each subsequent Payment Date thereafter, each such
installment to be in an aggregate principal amount computed in accordance with
the Amortization Schedule set forth in Exhibit B (which Amortization Schedule
may be revised by the Administrative Agent from time to time to take into
account (a) prepayments of the Loans pursuant to the terms hereof and the Master
Participation Agreement and (b) the actual first Payment Date); provided,
however, that the amount of the final payment of principal of the Loans shall in
any event be equal to the remaining unpaid principal amount of the Loans.

          3.02 Interest.

     (a) The Borrower hereby promises to pay to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of each Lender, interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Loan
from such Lender for the period from and including the date of such Loan to but
excluding the date such Loan shall be paid in full, at a rate per annum equal
to, for each Interest Period, the LIBOR Rate for such Loan for such Interest
Period plus the applicable Margin.

     (b) The Borrower agrees that during the Continuance of any MPA Event of
Default under Section 9.01 of the Master Participation Agreement (other than an
MPA Event of Default under Section 9.01(a) of the Master Participation Agreement
relating to this Agreement), the interest rate per annum which the Borrower is
obligated to pay in respect of each Interest Period pursuant to sub-Section (a)
above shall be increased by adding to such interest rate the Default Margin.

     (c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable on each Interest Payment
Date and upon any prepayment of a Loan (on the prepaid amount). Promptly after

therein, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to each of the
Lenders and the Borrower.

     (d) If any installment of principal of any Loan or any other amount
(including interest on a Loan) payable hereunder is not paid in full when due
(whether at the stated due date, by acceleration, by mandatory prepayment or
otherwise), the Borrower hereby agrees to pay from time to time upon demand
interest on the amount past due and unpaid for such period of time within each
related Default Interest Period during which such amount shall remain due and
unpaid, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in respect of principal, the Default
Margin plus the greater of (A) the rate of interest payable in respect of such
principal pursuant to Section 3.02(a) (or, if applicable, Section 5.02) in
effect immediately prior to such default in payment and (B) the sum of the LIBOR
Rate for such Default Interest Period plus the Margin and (ii) in respect of
such other amounts, the Default Margin plus the LIBOR Rate for such Default
Interest Period plus the Margin.

          4.01 Payments.

     (a) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest and other amounts to be made by the Borrower under this
Agreement and the Promissory Notes (including fees and indemnities) shall be

or any Promissory Note for the account of any Lender shall be paid by the
Administrative Agent promptly to such Lender, in immediately available funds,
for the account of such Lender's Applicable Lending Office for the Loan or other
obligation in respect of which such payment is made.

     (c) If the due date of any payment under this Agreement or any Promissory
Note would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, such date shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable
for any principal so extended for the

                                      -9-


period of such extension; provided, however, that if such next succeeding
Business Day falls in the following month, such date shall be the Business Day
immediately preceding such date.

          4.02 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein or in the Master Participation Agreement, the Loans shall be disbursed by
the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the maximum respective principal amounts
of each Lender's Commitment. The extent to which payments by the Borrower to any
Senior Facility Lender in respect of the Senior Loan Obligations must be a Pro
Rata Payment shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.04 of the Master
Participation Agreement.

          4.03 Computations. Interest on Loans and commitment fees shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
interest and commitment fees are payable.

          4.04 Certain Notices.

     (a) Notices by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent of borrowings,

          4.05 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Administrative Agent.

     (a) Without limiting Section 2.07 of the Master Participation Agreement,
unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Lender or the
Borrower (the "Payor") prior to the date on which the Payor is to make payment
to the Administrative Agent of (in the case of a Lender) the proceeds of a Loan
to be made by such Lender hereunder or (in the case of the Borrower) a payment
to the Administrative Agent for account of one or more of the Lenders hereunder
(such payment being herein called the "Required Payment"), which notice shall be
effective upon receipt, that the Payor does not intend to make the Required
Payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon such assumption
(but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof available to the
intended recipient(s) on such date; and, if the Payor has not in fact made the
Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, the recipient(s) of such payment
shall, on demand, repay to the Administrative Agent the amount so made available
together with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period
commencing on the date (the "Advance Date") such amount was so made available by
the Administrative Agent until the date the Administrative Agent recovers such
amount at a rate per annum equal to that indicated by the Administrative Agent
in a notice to such recipient(s) as the Administrative Agent's cost of funds for
such period (determined by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable
discretion, which determination shall be conclusive) and, if such recipient(s)
shall fail promptly to make such payment, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such amount, on demand, from the Payor, together with
interest as aforesaid.

     (b) If neither the recipient(s) nor the Payor shall return the Required
Payment to the Administrative Agent within three Business Days of the Advance
Date, then, retroactively to the Advance Date, the Payor and the recipient(s)
shall each be obligated to pay interest on the Required Payment as follows:

               (i) if the Required Payment shall represent a payment to be made
     by the Borrower, as the case may be, to the Lenders, the Payor(s) and the
     recipient(s) shall each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to
     pay interest in respect of the Required Payment at the rate of interest
     provided for pursuant to Section 3.02 (and, in case the recipient(s) shall
     return the Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, without limiting
     the obligation of any such Payor(s) under Section 3.02 to pay interest to
     such recipient(s) in respect of the Required Payment); and

               (ii) if the Required Payment shall represent proceeds of a Loan
     to be made by the Lenders to the Borrower, the Payor and the Borrower shall
     each be obligated retroactively to the Advance Date to pay interest in
     respect of the Required Payment at the rate of interest provided for such
     Required Payment pursuant to Section 3.02 (and, in case the Borrower shall
     return such Required Payment to the Administrative Agent, without limiting
     any claim the Borrower may have against the Payor in respect of the
     Required Payment).

     (c) In the event that the Payor and the recipient(s) both return the
Required Payment to the Administrative Agent together with interest thereon as
required hereby, the

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -11-


Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the recipient(s) such Required
Payment together with such interest paid by the recipient(s).

     (d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of any
receipt of notice by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower that the
Borrower does not intend to make the Required Payment to the Administrative
Agent for account of one or more of the Lenders.

          Section 5. Yield Protection, Etc.
          5.01 Additional Costs.

     (a) The Borrower shall pay directly to each Lender from time to time such
amounts as are necessary to compensate such Lender for any increase in costs
attributable to its making or maintaining of any Loans to the Borrower or its
obligation to make any Loans hereunder to the Borrower, or any reduction in any
amount receivable by such Lender hereunder in respect of any of such Loans or
such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable
being herein called "Additional Costs"), in each case, from those costs and
amounts receivable existing on the date hereof, resulting from any Regulatory
Change that:

          (i) imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar
     requirements, including any application of the Regulation D requirement,
     relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits
     with or other liabilities of, such Lender (including any of such Loans or
     any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Rate" in Section
     1.01), or any commitment of such Lender (including the Commitment of such
     Lender hereunder); or

          (ii) imposes or any Lender or the London interbank market any other
     condition affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender.

     (b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provisions of this Section
5.01 (but without duplication), the Borrower shall pay directly to each Lender
from time to time on request such amounts as such Lender may determine in good
faith to be necessary to compensate such Lender (or, without duplication, the
bank holding company of which such Lender is a subsidiary) for any increase in
costs that it in good faith determines is attributable to the maintenance by
such Lender (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company),
pursuant to any law or regulation or any interpretation, directive, guideline or
request (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to
comply therewith would be unlawful) of or by any court or governmental,
monetary, fiscal or other authority (i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii)
implementing any risk-based capital guideline or other requirement (whether or
not having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith
would be unlawful) issued after the date of this Agreement by any government or
governmental or supervisory authority implementing at the national level the
Basle Accord, of capital in respect of its Commitment or Loans (such
compensation to include, without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of
the rate of return on assets or equity of such Lender (or any Applicable Lending
Office or such bank holding company) to a level below that which such Lender (or
any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding company) could have achieved
but for such law, regulation, interpretation, directive, guideline or request).
For purposes of this Section 5.01(b), "Basle Accord" shall mean the proposals
for risk-based capital framework described by the Basle Committee on Banking

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -12-


Regulations and Supervisory Practices in its paper entitled "International
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as
amended, modified and supplemented and in effect from time to time or any
replacement thereof.

     (c) Section 5.01 does not apply, and no Lender shall be entitled to make
any claim under Section 5.01, to the extent any Additional Cost is attributable
directly or indirectly to the application of, compliance with or implementation
of any part or "pillar" of the International Convergence of Capital Measurement
Standards: a Revised Framework, published by the Basle Committee on Banking
Supervision in June 2004 (as in effect on the date hereof), or any
implementation or interpretation thereof, whether by any law or regulation, or
otherwise, or to any change by a Lender from one method of calculating capital
adequacy to another, insofar as such Additional Costs are directly or indirectly
attributable to credit-related events or circumstances that are specific to a
Lender and not solely to general regulatory guidelines or requirements imposed
on the commercial banking sector generally.

     (d) Each Lender shall notify the Borrower of any event occurring after the
date of this Agreement entitling such Lender to compensation under clause (a) or
(b) of this Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable, but in any event, within
six months after such Lender obtains actual knowledge thereof; provided, that if
such Lender fails to give such notice within six months after it obtains actual
knowledge of such an event, such Lender shall, with respect to compensation
payable pursuant to this Section 5.01 in respect of any Additional Costs
resulting from such event, only be entitled to payment under this Section 5.01
for costs incurred from and after the date six months prior to the date that
such Lender does give such notice. Each Lender shall designate a different
Applicable Lending Office, if possible, for the Loans of such Lender affected by
such event if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not, in the sole opinion of such Lender, be
disadvantageous to such Lender, except that such Lender shall have no obligation
to designate an Applicable Lending Office located in the United States of
America. Each Lender shall furnish to the Borrower a certificate setting forth
in reasonable detail the basis and amount of each request by such Lender for
compensation under clause (a) or (b) of this Section 5.01. The payment of any
such amount by the Borrower shall not preclude the Borrower from contesting such
calculation.

     (e) In the event that any Lender shall determine at any time that it is
required to maintain reserves in respect of Eurocurrency Liabilities during any
period during which the principal amount of any Loan is outstanding (each such
period, for such Lender, a "LIBOR Reserve Period"), but only in respect of any
period during which any reserve shall actually be maintained by such Lender for
the Loans as a result of a reserve requirement applicable to it under Regulation
D in connection with Eurocurrency Liabilities, then such Lender shall promptly
give notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such determination,
and the Borrower shall directly pay to such Lender additional interest on the
unpaid principal amount of such Loan during such LIBOR Reserve Period at a rate
per annum which shall, during each monthly period applicable to such Loan, be
the amount by which (i) the LIBOR Rate for such monthly period divided (and
rounded upward, if necessary, to the next whole multiple of 1/100 of 1%) by a
percentage equal to 100% minus the then-stated maximum rate of all reserve
requirements (including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency,
supplemental, special or other reserves) applicable to such Lender in respect of
Eurocurrency Liabilities exceeds (ii) the LIBOR Rate for such monthly period.
Any Lender so requesting compensation shall furnish along with such

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -13-


notice a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the cost actually
incurred to maintain such reserves and the basis for the determination of such
amount. Additional interest payable pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence shall be paid by the Borrower at the time that it is otherwise required
to pay interest in respect of such Loan or, if later demanded by any Lender,
promptly on the next Payment Date for any principal of the Loans after such
demand. Each Lender agrees that, if it gives notice to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent of the existence of a LIBOR Reserve Period, it shall
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any termination
thereof, at which time the Borrower shall cease to be obligated to pay
additional interest to such Lender pursuant to the first sentence of this
paragraph until such time, if any, as a subsequent LIBOR Reserve Period shall
occur.

     (f) Any determination or allocation made by any Lender pursuant to this
Section 5.01 shall be made by such Lender in good faith and, absent error, will
be conclusive, so long as such determination is applied to the Borrower in a
non-discriminatory manner as compared to similarly situated borrowers.

          5.02 Alternate Interest Rate. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of any LIBOR Rate for any
Interest Period or Default Interest Period:

          (a) the Administrative Agent determines, which determination shall be
     conclusive absent manifest error, that quotations of interest rates for the
     relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Rate" in Section
     1.01 hereof are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
     relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of interest as
     provided herein; or

          (b) the Majority Bank Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that (i)
     the relevant rates of interest referred to in the definition of "LIBOR
     Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof upon which the rate of interest for such
     Interest Period or Default Interest Period is to be determined will not
     adequately reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining Loans,
     or maintaining any other amount hereunder not paid when due, for such
     Interest Period or Default Interest Period or (ii) deposits in Dollars in
     the London interbank market are not available to Lenders in the ordinary
     course of business in sufficient amounts to make and/or maintain their
     Loans,

then the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower thereof and the
following provisions shall apply:

          (A) During the thirty-day period following the date of any such notice
     (the "Negotiation Period"), the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the
     Lenders) and the Borrower will negotiate in good faith for the purpose of
     agreeing upon an alternative, mutually acceptable basis (the "Substitute
     Basis") for determining the rate of interest to be applicable to Loans, and
     any other amounts hereunder not paid when due, from time to time and if, at
     the expiry of the Negotiation Period, the Administrative Agent (on behalf
     of the Lenders) and the Borrower have agreed upon a Substitute Basis and
     any required governmental approvals therefor have been obtained, the
     Substitute Basis shall take effect

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -14-


     from such date (including such retroactive date) as the Administrative
     Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) and the Borrower may in such circumstance
     agree.

          (B) If at the expiry of the Negotiation Period, a Substitute Basis
     shall not have been agreed upon or any required governmental approvals
     therefor shall not have been obtained, the Administrative Agent (with the
     consent of the Majority Bank Lenders) shall notify the Borrower of the cost
     to the Lenders (as reasonably determined by them) of funding and
     maintaining the outstanding affected Loans, and any other amounts hereunder
     not paid when due for such Interest Period or Default Interest Period and
     the interest payable to the Lenders on Loans and such other amounts not
     paid when due to which such Interest Period or Default Interest Period
     applies shall be interest at a rate per annum equal to the cost of funding
     and maintaining such Loans or such other amounts as so notified by the
     Administrative Agent plus the applicable Margin plus, during any Interest
     Period or any Default Interest Period, upon the occurrence and during the
     Continuance of any MPA Event of Default under Section 9.01 of the Master
     Participation Agreement (other than any Event of Default under Section
     9.01(a) thereof relating to this Agreement), the Default Margin.

The procedures specified in (A) and (B) above shall apply to each relevant
period succeeding the first such period to which they were applied unless and
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the condition referred
to in clause (a) of this Section 5.02 no longer exists or the Administrative
Agent (at the request of the Majority Bank Lenders) notifies the Borrower that
the condition referred to in clause (b) of this Section 5.02 no longer exists
(which notice the Lenders agree to give or cause to be given promptly following
the cessation of such condition), whereupon interest on Loans shall again be
determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.02, effective
commencing on the third Business Day after the date of such notice.

          5.03 Compensation. Upon request of the Administrative Agent on behalf
of any Lender, the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient to
indemnify it for any Funding Losses in accordance with Section 3.11 of the
Master Participation Agreement.

          5.04 Mitigation. If an event or circumstance occurs that would entitle
a Lender to exercise any of the rights or benefits afforded by this Section 5,
such Lender, promptly upon becoming aware of the same, shall take all steps as
may be reasonably available to eliminate or mitigate the effects of such event
or circumstance; provided, however, that such Lender shall not be under any
obligation to take any step that, in its sole discretion, would (a) result in
its incurring additional material costs or taxes or (b) otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender; provided, further, that the Borrower shall
reimburse any such Lender for all reasonable and documented costs and taxes
incurred pursuant to this Section 5.04.

          5.05 Applicable Lending Offices. A Lender may change its Applicable
Lending Office for any Loan by written notice to the Administrative Agent, the
Trustee and the Borrower and such notice shall be effective for purposes of this
Agreement as of the date specified therein.

          Section 10. The Administrative Agent.

          10.01 Appointment, Powers and Immunities.

     (a) Each Lender hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the
Administrative Agent to act as its agent hereunder, with such rights,
authorities, discretions and powers as are specifically delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms of this Agreement, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, and each Lender authorizes and
instructs the Administrative Agent to execute and deliver each of the Master
Participation Agreement, the Completion Guarantee, the Transfer Restrictions
Agreement and any other Financing Document to which such Lender and/or the
Administrative Agent is a party and each such Lender agrees to be bound by the
terms and conditions of each such agreement as if it had executed and delivered
such agreement for and in its own name.

     (b) Each Lender hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Administrative
Agent shall act for and on behalf of the Lenders hereunder for purposes of each
of the Master Participation Agreement, the Completion Guarantee and the Transfer
Restrictions Agreement, and each Lender hereby authorizes such action by the
Administrative Agent on its behalf in accordance with its appointment hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly upon
request of any Lender deliver any request, notice or communication permitted to
be given by any Senior Facility Lender under or pursuant to the Master
Participation Agreement, the Completion Guarantee and the Transfer Restrictions
Agreement.

     (c) The Administrative Agent (which term as used in this sentence and in
Section 10.05 shall include reference to its Affiliates and its Affiliates'
officers, directors, employees and agents) shall not: (i) have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, or by
reason of this Agreement be a trustee for any Lender, (ii) be responsible to the
Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided
for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement, or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement, any Promissory Note or any other document referred to or provided for
herein or for any failure by the Borrower or any other Person to perform any of
its obligations hereunder or thereunder, (iii) be required to initiate or
conduct any litigation or collection proceedings hereunder or (iv) be
responsible for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it hereunder or under
any other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or in
connection herewith, except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

     (d) The Administrative Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact, and
the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it in good faith.
The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Promissory Note as
the holder thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative
Agent.

     (e) Any bank serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -17-


lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or
Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          10.02 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon,
any certification, notice, request, consent, statement, instrument, document or
other communication (including any thereof by telephone, telecopy, telex,
telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice
and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Administrative Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided
for by this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder in accordance with
instructions given by the Majority Bank Lenders, and such instructions of the
Majority Bank Lenders and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (a) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, any
other Financing Document or the Sulfide Project, (b) the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection
herewith, (c) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements
or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (d) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (e) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Section 6 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items required
to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          10.03 Defaults. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of an MPA Default (other than the
non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans or of commitment fees) unless
the Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower
specifying such MPA Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of
Default". In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice of
the occurrence of any MPA Default, the Administrative Agent shall give prompt
notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower (and shall give each Lender
prompt notice of each such non-payment).

          10.04 Indemnification. The Lenders agree to indemnify the
Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.21 of the
Master Participation Agreement, but without limiting the obligations of the
Borrower under said Section 12.21 of the Master Participation Agreement) ratably
in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the Loans held by the
Lenders (or, if no Loans are at the time outstanding, ratably in accordance with
their respective Commitments), for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
claims, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, settlements, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever that may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against (including by any Lender) the Administrative
Agent arising out of or by reason of any investigation in or in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any other documents contemplated by or
referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, the costs and expenses that the Borrower is obligated to pay under
Section 12.21 of the Master Participation Agreement but excluding, unless an MPA
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, normal administrative costs and
expenses incident to the performance of the Administrative Agent's agency duties
hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -18-


or of any such other documents; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
liable for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent.

          10.05 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each
Lender agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the
Borrower and its respective Affiliates and its own decision to enter into this
Agreement and that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall not be required to keep itself informed as to the
performance or observance by the Borrower of this Agreement or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or to inspect the properties or
books of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents and
information expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder (as to which the Administrative Agent only shall
have the duty to forward what it has received), the Administrative Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information concerning the affairs, financial condition or business of the
Borrower or any of its respective Affiliates that may come into its possession.

          10.06 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required of the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall in all cases be
fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder unless it shall receive
further assurances to its satisfaction from the Lenders of their indemnification
obligations under Section 10.04 against any and all liability and expense that
may be incurred by the Administrative Agent by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action.

          10.07 Resignation or Removal of Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent, subject to the appointment of a successor as provided in
this Section 10.07, may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the
Borrower. The Administrative Agent may be removed as agent hereunder upon 30
days' notice by an instrument in writing signed by the Majority Bank Lenders and
the Borrower. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Bank Lenders
shall have the right, with the approval of the Borrower not to be unreasonably
withheld, to appoint a successor Administrative Agent. No removal or resignation
of a Administrative Agent or appointment of a successor Administrative Agent
shall be effective until (a) the appointment of a successor is accepted and (b)
solely in the case of a removal all indemnity and compensation required under
the Financing Documents have been paid or provided for. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by Majority Bank Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice
of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent with the approval of the
Borrower not to be unreasonably withheld which shall be a bank with an office in
New York, New York or London, or an affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as the Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Administrative Agent and the retiring Administrative Agent shall
be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -19-


fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the
same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the
Borrower and such successor. After a Administrative Agent's resignation
hereunder, the provisions of this Section 10 shall continue in effect for its
benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it
was acting as the Administrative Agent.

          10.08 Voting. Except as otherwise specified in the Master
Participation Agreement, in each instance that the Lenders are required to vote
hereunder, a vote shall be taken among the Lenders within the period of time
specified by the Administrative Agent.

          10.09 Administrative Agent Notices. The Administrative Agent agrees to
promptly furnish to each Lender a copy of each written communication (including
financial information and project reports) received by it from the Parent
Companies, the Borrower or the Trustee expressly relating to, and any amendment
or waiver of any of the provisions of, this Agreement, the Master Participation
Agreement, the Transfer Restrictions Agreement, the Security Documents, the
other Financing Documents, the Project Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, or from any Senior Lender pursuant to Section
10.02 of the Master Participation Agreement. In addition, the Administrative
Agent agrees to promptly advise each Lender of any material action taken, or any
action proposed by the Lenders to be taken that is not taken, by the Senior
Lenders at any meeting of Senior Lenders.

          Section 11. Miscellaneous.

          11.01 Waiver. Except as expressly provided herein, no failure on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender to exercise and no delay in
exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or any Promissory Note shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or any Promissory Note preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
The remedies provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

          11.02 Notices.

     (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices and other
communications provided for hereunder shall be (i) in writing (including
telecopier) and (ii) telecopied or sent by overnight courier (if for inland
delivery) or international courier (if for overseas delivery) to a party hereto
at its address and contact number specified in the signature pages hereto, or at
such other address and contact number as is designated by such party in a
written notice to the other parties hereto.

     (b) All such notices and communications shall be effective (i) if sent by

change shall be effective only upon receipt.

     (c) The Borrower agrees that the Administrative Agent may make any notices
and communications received hereunder (the "Communications") available to the
Lenders in an

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

                                      -20-


electronic/soft medium by posting the Communications on Intralinks or a
substantially similar electronic transmission system (the "Platform"). THE
PLATFORM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE". THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED
BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE
ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR
OMISSIONS IN THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,

LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF SUCH
CREDIT PARTY'S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT'S TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS
THROUGH THE INTERNET, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE LIABILITY OF ANY AGENT PARTY IS
FOUND IN A FINAL NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO
HAVE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SUCH AGENT PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT.

     (d) Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next sentence)
specifying that the Communications have been posted to the Platform shall
constitute effective delivery of the Communications to such Lender for purposes
of the Financing Documents. Each Lender agrees (i) to provide to the
Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic communication),
promptly after the date of this Agreement, an e-mail address to which the
foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the
foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

     (e) Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative Agent or

except that a waiver of rights, powers and privileges by the Senior Facility

Section 10.01 of the Master Participation Agreement.

     (d) Any modification, supplement or waiver shall be for such period and
shall be subject to such conditions as shall be specified in the instrument
effecting the same and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given.

          11.04 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

          11.05 Assignments and Participations.

     (a) The Borrower may not assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder
or under the Promissory Notes without the prior written consent of all of the
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and any attempted assignment or transfer
by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void).

     (b) Each of the Lenders may assign any and all of its rights and
obligations hereunder only pursuant to Section 12.13 of the Master Participation
Agreement. Upon execution and delivery by the assignee to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent of an assignment and
acceptance agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit C hereto (such
agreement, an "Assignment and Acceptance"), pursuant to which such assignee
agrees to become a "Lender" hereunder (if not already a Lender) having the
Commitment and Loans specified in such instrument, the assignee shall have, to
the extent of such assignment, the rights, obligations and benefits of a Lender
hereunder holding the Commitment and Loans (or portion(s) thereof) assigned to
it (in addition to the Commitment and Loans, if any, theretofore held by such
assignee) and the assigning Lender shall, to the extent of such assignment, be
released from the Commitment and Loans (or portion(s) thereof) so assigned (and,
in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lender's rights and obligations under this

                        Commercial Banks Loan Agreement

<PAGE>

                                      -22-


Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
entitled to, for periods during which it held the Loans, the benefits of
Sections 5.01 and 11.06 hereof and Sections 3.09 and 12.21 of the Master
Participation Agreement).

     (c) Each Lender may sell or agree to sell to one or more commercial banks
or lending institutions (a "Participant") a participation in all or any part of
its Loans, its Promissory Notes or in its Commitments; provided that no
Participant shall have any rights or benefits under this Agreement, any
Promissory Note or any other Financing Documents. All amounts payable by the
Borrower to any Lender under Section 5 in respect of Loans held by it, and its
Commitment, shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold or agreed to sell
any participations in such Loans and Commitment, and as if such Lender were
funding each of such Loan and Commitment in the same way that it is funding the
portion of such Loan and Commitment in which no participations have been sold.

     (d) A Lender or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, may furnish
any information concerning the Borrower in the possession of such Lender or the
Administrative Agent from time to time to assignees and Participants (including
prospective assignees and Participants) subject to the confidentiality
provisions set forth in Section 12.10 of the Master Participation Agreement.

          11.06 Survival/Reinstatement. The obligations of the Borrower under
Section 5 and the obligations of the Lenders under Section 10.04 shall survive
the repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments. This
Agreement shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time payment and performance of the Borrower's obligations hereunder,
or any part thereof, is, pursuant to applicable law, rescinded or reduced in
amount, or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender. In the event that any payment or any part thereof is so rescinded,
reduced, restored or returned, such obligations shall be reinstated and deemed
reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, restored or returned.

          11.07 No Immunity. To the extent that any party hereto has or
hereafter may acquire any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any
process (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution, execution, sovereign immunity or otherwise) with
respect to itself or its property, it irrevocably waives such immunity, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement and the Promissory Notes.

          11.08 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing
any such counterpart.

          11.09 GOVERNING LAW AND SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
NEW YORK. THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12.16 OF THE MASTER PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT

Participation Agreement shall be deemed incorporated herein in its entirety.

          11.12 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render

     the potential exercise of remedies pursuant to Article V of the Master
     Security Agreement (including by exercising its right to request the
     Administrative Agent to convene a meeting of the Senior Lenders), provided
     that so long as the Senior Facility Loans remain outstanding, the General
     Meeting described hereunder shall be prohibited from taking, or from
     directing the Common Representative to take, any other actions with respect
     to the exercise of remedies upon the occurrence of a Payment Event of
     Default.

               (B) In the event that such General Meeting resolves to direct the
          Common Representative to deliver to the Issuer a Notice of Payment
          Event of Default, the Common Representative shall (1) notify the
          Issuer, in writing, no later than the next Business Day following the
          day on which such General Meeting is held with respect to the general
          terms of the resolutions adopted at such General Meeting and (2)
          deliver such Notice of Payment Event of Default to the Issuer, with a

          (vi) (A) For the avoidance of doubt, the remedies set forth in this
     Section 8.03(b) and those granted to the Bondholders by Applicable Law
     shall, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section
     8.03(b), be the exclusive and sole remedies of the Bondholders upon the
     occurrence of a Payment Event of Default so long as the Senior Facility
     Loans remain outstanding.

     connection with the foreclosure upon the Collateral which secures all
     payment and other obligations of the Issuer under the Bonds and the Senior
     Facility Loan Agreements must be taken pursuant to the terms and conditions
     of the Master Security Agreement. Accordingly, Article 328 of the General
     Corporate Law should not be interpreted as providing an alternative way for
     individual Bondholders to foreclose upon the Collateral in a manner that is
     inconsistent with the specific terms and conditions provided for in the
     Master Security Agreement. Furthermore, no Bondholder can accelerate the
     payment obligations of principal or interest on the Bonds unless as
     expressly set forth under Article V of the Master Security Agreement or
     Section 8.03(e) of this Indenture. Accordingly, the parties expressly agree
     that the acceleration right contemplated under Article 1323 of the Peruvian
     Civil Code shall not be applicable to the payment obligations of the Issuer
     under the Bonds.

publication of two notices, one in the official gazette "El Peruano" and the
other in any high-circulation newspaper in Lima, indicating the date, time and
place for the first call of such meeting and the business to be transacted
thereat (it being understood that the Common Representative shall not be
required to take any other action for such purpose and that the Bondholders
shall not object to the sufficiency of notices published as described herein).
The notices described herein shall be published no less than [three (3)]
calendar days prior to the first call of the General Meeting or Special Meeting,
as the case may be, and shall contain the contemplated date for the second call,
which shall be ten (10) calendar days after the day of the first call, in the
event that the Bondholders attending the General Meeting or Special Meeting, as
the case may be, fail to satisfy the quorum requirements of this Indenture in
the first call. If the published notice does not indicate the date of the second
call, then an additional notice shall be published for such second call, which
notice shall meet the formalities set forth in this Section 10.03(d).

     Section 10.04 Quorum, Installation and Resolutions.

     (a) The Common Representative shall chair any General Meeting except as
otherwise provided in this Indenture or as otherwise determined by one or more
Bondholders present at a General Meeting that represent a simple majority of the

     (b) The Common Representative shall chair any Special Meeting except as
otherwise provided in this Indenture or as otherwise determined by one or more
Bondholders present at a Special Meeting that represent a simple majority of the
aggregate face value of the then-outstanding Bonds of the applicable Issue. The
person designated by the chairman of the Special Meeting shall act as secretary.

     (c) For purposes of calculating the quorum requirements and majorities
applicable to a General Meeting or Special Meeting, as the case may be, the face
value of the then-outstanding Bonds shall be used. Therefore, each Bondholder
attending a General Meeting or Special Meeting, as the case may be, shall
represent an aggregate face value resulting from multiplying the number of Bonds
held in such Bondholder's name by the face value of such Bonds.

     (d) (i) The required quorum for a General Meeting to be duly installed on
first notice shall be Bondholders representing at least a simple majority of the
aggregate face value of the then-outstanding Bonds.

          (ii) The required quorum for a General Meeting to be duly installed on
     second notice shall be those Bondholders present at such General Meeting,
     either in person or by proxy.

     (e) (i) The required quorum for a Special Meeting to be duly installed on
first notice shall be Bondholders representing at least a simple majority of the
aggregate face value of the then-outstanding Bonds of the specific Issue.

          then-outstanding Bonds of the applicable Issue duly represented at the
          Special Meeting (for the second call of the Special Meeting) shall be

          whether in whole or in part.

               (F) The approval of Bondholders representing no less than sixty

     that amends any terms and conditions of this Indenture or the applicable

                            ISSUER'S INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 11.01 Claims Indemnified. The Issuer shall indemnify and hold
harmless all of the Common Representative and any of its affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents or representatives (each, an "INDEMNITEE" and,
collectively, the "INDEMNITEES") from any legal action claim (whether in-court,
out-of-court or administrative), penalty, loss or liability, or expenditure,
including reasonable attorneys fees and personal defense costs (hereinafter, a
"CLAIM") resulting or arising from any of the activities of the Common
Representative contemplated in this Indenture and/or the Supplemental
Indentures.

     Section 11.02 Claims Excluded. Any Claim that is the result of the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnitee, which such gross negligence
or willful misconduct shall be determined by a Court of Arbitration in
accordance with Article XII of this Indenture, shall be excluded from the
Issuer's agreement to indemnify any Indemnitee under Section 11.01 above.

     Section 11.03 Claim Procedure. (a) Each Indemnitee shall provide the Issuer
with written notice of any Claim against it together with a statement of such
Indemnitee stating in reasonable detail the basis for the indemnification sought
thereby. Further, each Indemnitee shall keep the Issuer informed of the status
of any Claim against it.

     (b) Promptly after the Issuer receives notification of a Claim pursuant to
subsection (a), the Issuer shall notify the applicable Indemnitee as to whether
it intends to pay, object to, compromise or defend any matter involving the
asserted liability of such Indemnitee. In the event that the Issuer elects to
defend a Claim against an Indemnitee, (i) such Indemnitee shall promptly grant
to the legal advisors designated by the Issuer the powers required to take on
such defense and (ii) the Issuer shall be responsible for the payment of all
costs and expenses relating to such defense, including the retention of legal
advisors; provided that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain its own legal
advisors; provided further that the Issuer shall be responsible for the payment
of the reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnitee's legal advisors.

     (c) No Indemnitee may compromise or settle a Claim without the prior
written consent of the Issuer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless such Indemnitee waives its rights to indemnification hereunder.

     Section 11.04 Issuer's Rights Under Applicable Law. The provisions of this
Article XI are not exclusive or limiting, and are not intended to preclude or
limit any right to which the Issuer may be entitled under Applicable Law to
exercise against any Indemnitee for damages that such Indemnitee may cause the
Issuer due to its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   ARBITRATION

intent of the parties hereto that any conflicts or disputes that may arise in
relation to the performance of this Indenture or of the Supplemental Indentures,
as well as any matter related to the Program, be resolved as expeditiously as
possible, each of the parties hereby agrees that any lawsuit, dispute, claim or
disagreement in connection with the interpretation, performance, validity,
termination, effectiveness of, or arising from or in relation to, this
Indenture, the Supplemental Indentures or any other document materially relevant
to the Program that cannot be resolved by mutual agreement of the parties to
such dispute within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date on which one
of the parties to such dispute notifies the other in writing of the existence of
such dispute, then it shall be settled by arbitration of law (arbitraje de
derecho) according to the procedures set forth in this Article XII and
Applicable Law.

     (b) The arbitration proceedings regulated in this Article XII shall also
apply to the resolution of any conflict or dispute between the Issuer and
Bondholders and the Common Representative or any of them that may arise in

Indentures, as well as any matter related to the Program, provided that any
individual Bondholder may elect to resolve conflicts or disputes related to the
collection of payment of principal or interest of the Bonds through a summary
proceeding (proceso ejecutivo) as long as such an election by the individual
Bondholder is not in any manner inconsistent with any resolution with respect to
the same conflict or dispute reached at a Special Meeting or the General
Meeting, as the case may be, convened in accordance with Section 8.03 or Section
8.04 of this Indenture.

     Section 12.02 Arbitration Procedure. The aforementioned arbitration shall

the parties may request the appointment of an arbitrator by the National and
International Settlement and Arbitration Center of the Lima Chamber of Commerce
(Centro de Conciliacion y Arbitraje Nacional e Internacional de la Camara de
Comercio de Lima).

     (c) In the event that the appointment of a substitute arbitrator becomes
necessary under any circumstance, such substitute arbitrator shall be appointed
pursuant to the procedure set forth in Section 12.02(b) above.

     (d) In the event that any party deems it necessary to seek the intervention
of ordinary judges and courts in an arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to
this Article XII, including, without limitation, to request injunctive relief in
connection with such arbitration proceeding or execution of the arbitration
award, each of the parties hereby expressly submits to the jurisdiction of the
judges and courts of the judicial district of Lima, waiving the jurisdiction of
its respective place of business.

     (e) Any arbitration proceeding commenced pursuant to this Article XII shall
not exceed a period of sixty (60) Business Days following the date of
appointment of the last arbitrator and, to the extent not otherwise established
herein, shall be governed by the provisions of the National Arbitration
Regulations of the Center of National and International Settlement and
Arbitration of the Lima Chamber of Commerce or, otherwise, by Law No
26572, as amended or supplemented, as the case may be.

     (f) Any arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties, and
each of the parties hereby waives its right to file any appeal relating to such
arbitration award other than for clarification thereof.

     (g) All costs and expenses incurred in the course of any arbitration
proceeding commenced pursuant to this Article XII shall be borne by the party
against whom the arbitration award is granted, including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees of such legal counsel and experts that each party may engage
in connection with such arbitration proceeding.

     (h) Nothing in this Article XII shall limit the provisions of Article IX of
the Master Security Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

WHEREAS, as a condition to the Senior Lenders extending Senior Loans to the

in the Operator's Agreement to the Offshore Collateral Agent for the benefit and
on behalf of the Senior Lenders; and

WHEREAS, as a further condition to the Senior Lenders extending Senior Loans to

time to time, the "Master Security Agreement" or "MSA"). The rules of
interpretation set forth in Section 1.02 of the Master Participation Agreement
are incorporated herein as if set forth herein.

     2. Representations and Warranties. The Consenting Party hereby represents
and warrants that:

          (a) It is an entity duly organized, validly existing and is in good
     standing under the laws of the place in which it is organized.

          (b) It has full power and authority to execute and deliver the
     Operator's Agreement and this Consent and to perform its obligations
     thereunder

<PAGE>

     and hereunder in accordance with the terms provided therein and herein and
     will not require any additional consent or approval of its board of
     directors, any of its shareholders or any other Person which it has not
     already obtained.

          (c) Each of the Operator's Agreement and this Consent has been duly
     authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and
     legally binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
     subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
     moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

          (d) All Governmental Approvals and other third party approvals which
     are necessary for (i) the execution and delivery by it of the Operator's
     Agreement and this Consent, (ii) the performance of its obligations
     thereunder and hereunder and (iii) the exercise by the Offshore Collateral
     Agent of the rights and remedies with respect to the Operator's Agreement
     (other than Governmental Approvals, if any, required to transfer the
     Operator's Agreement to the Offshore Collateral Agent or its assignees)
     have been obtained and are in full force and effect.

          (e) There is no provision of law, statute, regulation, rule, order,
     injunction, decree, writ or judgment, no provision of its organizational
     documents and no provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract or
     agreement binding on it or affecting its properties, which would prohibit,
     conflict with or in any way prevent its execution, delivery, or performance
     of the terms of the Operator's Agreement or this Consent.

          (f) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation, at law or
     in equity, or before any Governmental Authority or other Person, pending
     or, to the best knowledge of the Consenting Party, threatened, against or
     affecting it or its assets that (i) questions the validity of the
     Operator's Agreement or this Consent or any action taken or to be taken
     pursuant hereto or thereto, or (ii) in any case or in the aggregate would
     reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
     ability of the Consenting Party to perform its obligations hereunder or
     thereunder.

          (g) The Consenting Party is not in default under any material covenant
     or obligation under the Operator's Agreement and no such default has
     occurred prior to the date hereof. To the best knowledge of the Consenting
     Party, the Borrower is not in default under any material covenant or
     obligation under the Operator's Agreement and no such default has occurred
     prior to the date hereof. The Consenting Party and, to the best of its
     knowledge, the Borrower, have complied with all conditions precedent to the
     respective obligations of such party to perform under the Operator's
     Agreement. The Operator's Agreement, as of the

     the Borrower's rights under the Operator's Agreement have been waived.

     3. Consent and Agreement. The Consenting Party hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision in the Operator's Agreement:

          (a) Pursuant to the Master Security Agreement, the Borrower has
     granted, transferred and assigned to the Offshore Collateral Agent, as
     collateral agent for the benefit of Senior Lenders named in the Master
     Security Agreement, all right, title and interest which Borrower now has or
     which shall hereafter arise in and to the Operator's Agreement and all
     claims resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with any of
     the provisions of the Operator's Agreement, together with full power and
     authority, in its own name or in the name of Borrower or otherwise, to
     enforce and request payment under the Operator's Agreement and to collect,
     receive and give receipts and releases for such amounts.

          (b) The Consenting Party hereby irrevocably consents to and accepts
     the grant, transfer and assignment by the Borrower to the Offshore
     Collateral Agent for the benefit of and on behalf of the Senior Lenders of
     all of Borrower's right, title and interest in the Operator's Agreement and
     all claims resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with any
     of the provisions of the Operator's Agreement, together with full power and
     authority, in the name of the Borrower, to enforce the Operator's Agreement
     against the Consenting Party, it being understood and agreed that any
     enforcement by the Offshore Collateral Agent shall not require any further
     consent from the Consenting Party or constitute a default under the
     Operator's Agreement. The Consenting Party hereby irrevocably further
     agrees for the benefit of the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Senior
     Lenders in case of a default under the Operator's Agreement by the
     Borrower, to accept performance by a Person designated by the Offshore
     Collateral Agent (or one or more of its representatives or assignees (the
     "Designee"), as instructed by the Administrative Agent) and neither the
     Offshore Collateral Agent nor its Designee shall be subject to any defense
     arising from the Borrower's failure to perform, provided that the
     Designee's performance shall in all other respects be in accordance with
     the provisions of the Operator's Agreement. In no event shall any grant,
     transfer, assignment or acceptance of performance pursuant to this Section
     3(b) change or modify Borrower's obligations to the Consenting Party
     thereunder.

          (c) The Consenting Party shall deliver to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent at the address specified in Section 5(j), or at such other address as
     the Offshore Collateral Agent may designate in writing from time to time to
     the Consenting Party, concurrently with delivery thereof to the Borrower, a
     copy of any material notice, request, demand or other document given by the
     Consenting


                                        3

<PAGE>

     Party in connection with the Operator's Agreement, along with notice of any
     material breach, termination or claim of termination under the Operator's
     Agreement for which notice to the Borrower is required under the Operator's
     Agreement.

          (d) The Consenting Party will not, without the prior written consent
     of the Supermajority Facility Lenders, take any action to (i) except as
     expressly provided in the Operator's Agreement, cancel or terminate, or
     suspend performance under, the Operator's Agreement or consent to or accept
     any cancellation, termination or suspension thereof, (ii) exercise any of
     its rights set forth in the Operator's Agreement to cancel or terminate, or
     suspend or discontinue performance or withhold deliveries under, the
     Operator's Agreement unless the Consenting Party shall have delivered to
     the Offshore Collateral Agent and each Senior Lender written notice stating
     that it intends to exercise such right on a date not less than 30 days
     after the date of such notice, specifying the nature of the default giving
     rise to such right (and, in the case of a payment default, specifying the
     amount thereof) and permitting the Offshore Collateral Agent or its
     Designee on behalf of the Senior Lenders to cure such default by making a
     payment in the amount in default or by performing or causing to be
     performed the obligation in default (or if such default is not capable of
     being cured within said time, then diligently and continuously pursuing all
     reasonable actions necessary to effect cure), (iii) amend, supplement or
     otherwise modify the Operator's Agreement (as in effect on the date hereof)
     unless such amendment or modification would be permitted by Section 7.12 of
     the Master Participation Agreement or (iv) petition, request or take any
     other legal or administrative action which seeks, or may reasonably be
     expected, to rescind, terminate or suspend or amend or modify the
     Operator's Agreement or any part thereof, other than to enforce rights to
     which the Consenting Party is entitled pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of
     this paragraph. In furtherance of the foregoing clause (ii), the Consenting
     Party agrees that, notwithstanding anything contained in the Operator's
     Agreement to the contrary, upon the occurrence of a default under the
     Operator's Agreement that cannot by its nature be cured by the payment of
     money, the Consenting Party will not cancel or terminate the Operator's
     Agreement if, and for so long as, the Offshore Collateral Agent shall be
     diligently seeking to institute foreclosure proceedings, or to acquire the
     Borrower's interest in the Operator's Agreement, and the Consenting Party
     shall grant the Offshore Collateral Agent a reasonable period of time to
     cure such default upon the occurrence of such foreclosure or acquisition.

          (e) In the event that (i) the Operator's Agreement is rejected by a
     trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding
     involving the Borrower or (ii) the Operator's Agreement is terminated as a
     result of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving the Borrower
     and, if within


                                        4

<PAGE>

     60 days after notice by the Consenting Party to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent of such rejection or termination, the Offshore Collateral Agent or
     its Designee shall so request and shall certify in writing to the
     Consenting Party that such party intends to perform the obligations of the
     Borrower as and to the extent required under the Operator's Agreement and
     such Designee is sufficiently creditworthy to perform the obligations of
     the Borrower under the Operator's Agreement, the Consenting Party will
     execute and deliver to the Offshore Collateral Agent or such Designee a new
     Operator's Agreement which shall be for the balance of the remaining term
     under the original Operator's Agreement before giving effect to such
     rejection or termination and shall contain the same conditions, agreements,
     terms, provisions and limitations as the agreements, terms, provisions and
     limitations as the original Operator's Agreement (except for any
     requirements which have been fulfilled by the Borrower and the Consenting
     Party prior to such rejection or termination). References in this Consent
     and Agreement to such "Operator's Agreement" shall be deemed also to refer
     to such new Operator's Agreement.

          (f) The Consenting Party and the Borrower hereby further acknowledge
     and agree that the Consenting Party will not, without the prior written
     consent of the Supermajority Facility Lenders, sell, assign, transfer or
     otherwise dispose of (by operation of law or otherwise) any part of its
     interest in the Operator's Agreement; provided, that in no event shall the
     Consenting Party sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of any part of
     its interest in the Operator's Agreement to any Person unless such Person
     is a wholly-owned direct or indirect subsidiary of Phelps Dodge Corporation
     or is another entity satisfactory to the Supermajority Facility Lenders.

          (g) In the event that the Designee succeeds to the Borrower's interest
     under the Operator's Agreement, whether by foreclosure or otherwise, the
     Designee may elect (but shall not be required to) by written notice of
     assumption delivered to the Consenting Party to assume liability for all of
     the Borrower's obligations under the Operator's Agreement (and the
     Consenting Party shall not be obligated to recognize any such succession
     until it has received such written notice of assumption); provided, however
     that such liability shall not include any liability for claims of the
     Consenting Party against the Borrower arising from the Borrower's failure
     to perform during the period prior to the Offshore Collateral Agent's or
     such Designee's succession to the Borrower's interest in and under the
     Operator's Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the immediately
     preceding sentence, the Designee shall not be liable for the performance or
     observance of any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower under the
     Operator's Agreement, nor shall the grant of a security interest in the
     Operator's Agreement by the Borrower to the Offshore Collateral Agent on
     behalf of the Senior Lenders give


                                        5

<PAGE>

     rise to any duties or obligations whatsoever on the part of the Offshore
     Collateral Agent owing to the Consenting Party.

          (h) Upon the exercise by the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of
     the Senior Lenders of any of the remedies set forth in the Master Security
     Agreement, the Offshore Collateral Agent may, to the extent permitted by
     Article V of the Master Security Agreement, assign its rights and interests
     and the rights and interests of the Borrower under the Operator's Agreement
     to any purchaser or transferee of the Offshore Collateral, if such
     purchaser or transferee shall (i) assume all of the obligations of the
     Borrower under the Operator's Agreement and (ii) be, in the reasonable
     opinion of the Consenting Party, sufficiently creditworthy to perform the
     obligations of the Borrower under the Operator's Agreement. Upon such
     assignment and assumption, the Senior Lenders shall be relieved of all
     obligations under the Operator's Agreement arising after such assignment
     and assumption.

          (i) In the event that the Designee shall assume or be liable for any
     obligation under the Operator's Agreement (as contemplated in clause (g)
     above or otherwise), such liability shall be limited solely to such party's
     interest in the Offshore Collateral (and no officer, director, employee,
     shareholder or agent thereof shall have any liability with respect
     thereto).

     4. Payment Arrangements. The Consenting Party hereby agrees that it shall
make, or cause to be made by any person making payment on its behalf, all
payments due or to become due from it under the Operator's Agreement by wire
transfer in U.S. Dollars of same day funds directly to Proceeds Account account
no.105487, in the name of Citibank N.A., at Citibank N.A. or such other account
or accounts at such other bank or banks as are designate from time to time by
the Offshore Collateral Agent.

     5. Miscellaneous.

          (a) This Consent shall be binding upon the Consenting Party, its
     successors and assigns and shall inure, together with the rights and
     remedies of the Offshore Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the
     Borrower and the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of the Senior Lenders

     standing under the laws of the place in which it is organized.

          (b) It has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
     Consent and to perform its obligations hereunder in accordance with the
     terms provided herein and will not require any additional consent or
     approval of its board of director, any of its shareholders or any other
     Person which it has not already obtained.


                                        2

<PAGE>

          (c) This Consent has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
     it and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement, enforceable in
     accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
     conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
     applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
     equity principles.

          (d) All Governmental Approvals and other third party approvals which
     are necessary for (i) the execution and delivery by it of this Consent,
     (ii) the performance of its obligations hereunder and (iii) the exercise by
     the Offshore Collateral Agent of the rights and remedies with respect to
     the Engineering Agreement (other than Governmental Approvals, if any,
     required to transfer the Engineering Agreement to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent or its assignees) have been obtained and are in full force and
     effect.

          (e) There is no provision of law, statute, regulation, rule, order,
     injunction, decree, writ or judgment, no provision of its organizational
     documents and no provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract or
     agreement binding on it or affecting its properties, which would prohibit,
     conflict with or in any way prevent its execution, delivery, or performance
     of the terms of this Consent.

          (f) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation, at law or
     in equity, or before any Governmental Authority or other Person, pending
     or, to the best knowledge of the Consenting Party, threatened, against or
     affecting it or its assets that (i) questions the validity of this Consent
     or any action taken or to be taken pursuant hereto or thereto, or (ii) in
     any case or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to result in a
     material adverse effect on the ability of the Consenting Party to perform
     its obligations hereunder.

          (g) The Consenting Party is not in default under any material covenant
     or obligation under the Engineering Agreement and no such default has
     occurred prior to the date hereof. To the best knowledge of the Consenting
     Party, the Borrower is not in default under any material covenant or
     obligation under the Engineering Agreement and no such default has occurred
     prior to the date hereof. The Consenting Party and, to the best of its
     knowledge, the Borrower, have complied with all conditions precedent to the
     respective obligations of such party to perform under the Engineering
     Agreement. The Engineering Agreement, as of the date hereof, is in full
     force and effect, has not been amended, and none of the Borrower's rights
     under the Engineering Agreement have been waived.

     3. Consent and Agreement. The Consenting Party hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision in the Engineering Agreement:

          (a) Pursuant to the Master Security Agreement, the Borrower has
     granted, transferred and assigned to the Offshore Collateral Agent, as
     collateral


                                        3

<PAGE>

     agent for the benefit of Senior Lenders named in the Master Security
     Agreement, all right, title and interest which Borrower now has or which
     shall hereafter arise in and to the Engineering Agreement and all claims
     resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with any of the
     provisions of the Engineering Agreement, together with full power and
     authority, in its own name or in the name of Borrower or otherwise, to
     enforce and request payment under the Engineering Agreement and to collect,
     receive and give receipts and releases for such amounts.

          (b) The Consenting Party hereby irrevocably consents to and accepts
     the grant, transfer and assignment by the Borrower to the Offshore
     Collateral Agent for the benefit of and on behalf of the Senior Lenders of
     all of Borrower's right, title and interest in the Engineering Agreement
     and all claims resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with
     any of the provisions of the Engineering Agreement, together with full
     power and authority, in the name of the Borrower, to enforce the
     Engineering Agreement against the Consenting Party, it being understood and
     agreed that any enforcement by the Offshore Collateral Agent shall not
     require any further consent from the Consenting Party or constitute a
     default under the Engineering Agreement. The Consenting Party hereby
     irrevocably further agrees for the benefit of the Offshore Collateral Agent
     and the Senior Lenders in case of a default under the Engineering Agreement
     by the Borrower, to accept performance by a Person designated by the
     Offshore Collateral Agent (or one or more of its representatives or
     assignees (the "Designee"), as instructed by the Administrative Agent) and
     neither the Offshore Collateral Agent nor its Designee shall be subject to
     any defense arising from the Borrower's failure to perform, provided that
     the Designee's performance shall in all other respects be in accordance
     with the provisions of the Engineering Agreement.

          (c) The Consenting Party shall deliver to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent at the address specified in Section 5(j), or at such other address as
     the Offshore Collateral Agent may designate in writing from time to time to
     the Consenting Party, concurrently with delivery thereof to the Borrower, a
     copy of any material notice, request, demand or other document given by the
     Consenting Party in connection with the Engineering Agreement, along with
     notice of any material breach, termination or claim of termination under
     the Engineering Agreement for which notice to the Borrower is required
     under the Engineering Agreement.

          (d) In the event that the Designee succeeds to the Borrower's interest
     under the Engineering Agreement, whether by foreclosure or otherwise, the
     Designee may elect (but shall not be required to) by written notice of
     assumption delivered to the Consenting Party to assume liability for all of
     the Borrower's


                                        4

<PAGE>

     obligations under the Engineering Agreement (and the Consenting Party shall
     not be obligated to recognize any such succession until it has received
     such written notice of assumption); provided, however that such liability
     shall not include any liability for claims of the Consenting Party against
     the Borrower arising from the Borrower's failure to perform during the
     period prior to the Offshore Collateral Agent's or such Designee's
     succession to the Borrower's interest in and under the Engineering
     Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the immediately preceding
     sentence, the Designee shall not be liable for the performance or
     observance of any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower under the
     Engineering Agreement, nor shall the grant of a security interest in the
     Engineering Agreement by the Borrower to the Offshore Collateral Agent on
     behalf of the Senior Lenders give rise to any duties or obligations
     whatsoever on the part of the Offshore Collateral Agent owing to the
     Consenting Party.

          (e) Upon the exercise by the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of
     the Senior Lenders of any of the remedies set forth in the Master Security
     Agreement, the Offshore Collateral Agent may, to the extent permitted by
     Article V of the Master Security Agreement, assign its rights and interests
     and the rights and interests of the Borrower under the Engineering
     Agreement to any purchaser or transferee of the Offshore Collateral, if
     such purchaser or transferee shall (i) assume all of the obligations of the
     Borrower under the Engineering Agreement and (ii) be, in the reasonable
     opinion of the Consenting Party, sufficiently creditworthy to perform the
     obligations of the Borrower under the Engineering Agreement. Upon such
     assignment and assumption, the Senior Lenders shall be relieved of all
     obligations under the Engineering Agreement arising after such assignment
     and assumption.

          (f) In the event that the Designee shall assume or be liable for any
     obligation under the Engineering Agreement (as contemplated in clause (d)
     above or otherwise), such liability shall be limited solely to such party's
     interest in the Offshore Collateral (and no officer, director, employee,
     shareholder or agent thereof shall have any liability with respect
     thereto).

          (g) In no event shall any grant, transfer, assignment or acceptance of
     performance pursuant to this Section 3 change, modify or increase
     Borrower's obligations to the Consenting Party or the Consenting Party's
     obligations to the Borrower under the Engineering Agreement and any related
     agreement.

     4. Payment Arrangements. The Consenting Party hereby agrees that it shall
make, or cause to be made by any person making payment on its behalf, all
payments due or to become due from it under the Engineering Agreement by wire
transfer in U.S. Dollars of same day funds directly to Proceeds Account account
no.105487, in the name of Citibank N.A., at Citibank N.A. or such other account
or accounts at such other bank or banks as are designate from time to time by
the Offshore Collateral Agent.

     Borrower and the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of the Senior Lenders

     suit or proceeding. The Consenting Party hereby waives any objection which
     it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid
     actions, suits or proceedings, brought in any such court and hereby further
     waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
     action, suit or proceeding brought therein has been brought in an
     inconvenient forum.

          (f) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted
     by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
     proceeding arising out of or relating to this Consent or the transactions
     contemplated hereby.

          (g) If any provision of this Consent shall be held to be invalid,
     illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
     remaining provisions in such jurisdiction and the validity, legality and
     enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction shall not in any

          (b) It has full power and authority to execute and deliver this

          (c) This Consent has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
     it and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement, enforceable in

<PAGE>

     Construction Agreement to the Offshore Collateral Agent or its assignees)
     have been obtained and are in full force and effect.

          (e) There is no provision of law, statute, regulation, rule, order,
     injunction, decree, writ or judgment, no provision of its organizational
     documents and no provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract or
     agreement binding on it or affecting its properties, which would prohibit,
     conflict with or in any way prevent its execution, delivery, or performance
     of the terms of this Consent.

          (f) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation, at law or
     in equity, or before any Governmental Authority or other Person, pending
     or, to the best knowledge of the Consenting Party, threatened, against or
     affecting it or its assets that (i) questions the validity of this Consent
     or any action taken or to be taken pursuant hereto or thereto, or (ii) in
     any case or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to result in a
     material adverse effect on the ability of the Consenting Party to perform
     its obligations hereunder.

          (g) The Consenting Party is not in default under any material covenant
     or obligation under the Construction Agreement and no such default has
     occurred prior to the date hereof. To the best knowledge of the Consenting
     Party, the Borrower is not in default under any material covenant or
     obligation under the Construction Agreement and no such default has
     occurred prior to the date hereof. The Consenting Party and, to the best of
     its knowledge, the Borrower, have complied with all conditions precedent to
     the respective obligations of such party to perform under the Construction
     Agreement. The Construction Agreement, as of the date hereof, is in full
     force and effect, has not been amended, and none of the Borrower's rights
     under the Construction Agreement have been waived.

     3. Consent and Agreement. The Consenting Party hereby acknowledges and
agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision in the Construction Agreement:

          (a) Pursuant to the Master Security Agreement, the Borrower has
     granted, transferred and assigned to the Offshore Collateral Agent, as
     collateral agent for the benefit of Senior Lenders named in the Master
     Security Agreement, all right, title and interest which Borrower now has or
     which shall hereafter arise in and to the Construction Agreement and all
     claims resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with any of
     the provisions of the Construction Agreement, together with full power and
     authority, in its own name or in the name of Borrower or otherwise, to
     enforce and request payment under the Construction Agreement and to
     collect, receive and give receipts and releases for such amounts.

          (b) The Consenting Party hereby irrevocably consents to and accepts
     the grant, transfer and assignment by the Borrower to the Offshore
     Collateral


                                        3

<PAGE>

     Agent for the benefit of and on behalf of the Senior Lenders of all of
     Borrower's right, title and interest in the Construction Agreement and all
     claims resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with any of
     the provisions of the Construction Agreement, together with full power and
     authority, in the name of the Borrower, to enforce the Construction
     Agreement against the Consenting Party, it being understood and agreed that
     any enforcement by the Offshore Collateral Agent shall not require any
     further consent from the Consenting Party or constitute a default under the
     Construction Agreement. The Consenting Party hereby irrevocably further
     agrees for the benefit of the Offshore Collateral Agent and the Senior
     Lenders in case of a default under the Construction Agreement by the
     Borrower, to accept performance by a Person designated by the Offshore
     Collateral Agent (or one or more of its representatives or assignees (the
     "Designee"), as instructed by the Administrative Agent) and neither the
     Offshore Collateral Agent nor its Designee shall be subject to any defense
     arising from the Borrower's failure to perform, provided that the
     Designee's performance shall in all other respects be in accordance with
     the provisions of the Construction Agreement.

          (c) The Consenting Party shall deliver to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent at the address specified in Section 5(j), or at such other address as
     the Offshore Collateral Agent may designate in writing from time to time to
     the Consenting Party, concurrently with delivery thereof to the Borrower, a
     copy of any material notice, request, demand or other document given by the
     Consenting Party in connection with the Construction Agreement, along with
     notice of any material breach, termination or claim of termination under
     the Construction Agreement for which notice to the Borrower is required
     under the Construction Agreement.

          (d) In the event that the Designee succeeds to the Borrower's interest
     under the Construction Agreement, whether by foreclosure or otherwise, the
     Designee may elect (but shall not be required to) by written notice of
     assumption delivered to the Consenting Party to assume liability for all of
     the Borrower's obligations under the Construction Agreement (and the
     Consenting Party shall not be obligated to recognize any such succession
     until it has received such written notice of assumption); provided, however
     that such liability shall not include any liability for claims of the
     Consenting Party against the Borrower arising from the Borrower's failure
     to perform during the period prior to the Offshore Collateral Agent's or
     such Designee's succession to the Borrower's interest in and under the
     Construction Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the immediately
     preceding sentence, the Designee shall not be liable for the performance or
     observance of any of the obligations or duties of the Borrower under the
     Construction Agreement, nor shall the grant of a security interest in the
     Construction Agreement by the Borrower to the Offshore Collateral Agent on


                                        4

<PAGE>

     behalf of the Senior Lenders give rise to any duties or obligations
     whatsoever on the part of the Offshore Collateral Agent owing to the
     Consenting Party.

          (e) Upon the exercise by the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of
     the Senior Lenders of any of the remedies set forth in the Master Security
     Agreement, the Offshore Collateral Agent may, to the extent permitted by
     Article V of the Master Security Agreement, assign its rights and interests
     and the rights and interests of the Borrower under the Construction
     Agreement to any purchaser or transferee of the Offshore Collateral, if
     such purchaser or transferee shall (i) assume all of the obligations of the
     Borrower under the Construction Agreement and (ii) be, in the reasonable
     opinion of the Consenting Party, sufficiently creditworthy to perform the
     obligations of the Borrower under the Construction Agreement. Upon such
     assignment and assumption, the Senior Lenders shall be relieved of all
     obligations under the Construction Agreement arising after such assignment
     and assumption.

          (f) In the event that the Designee shall assume or be liable for any
     obligation under the Construction Agreement (as contemplated in clause (d)
     above or otherwise), such liability shall be limited solely to such party's
     interest in the Offshore Collateral (and no officer, director, employee,
     shareholder or agent thereof shall have any liability with respect
     thereto).

          (g) In no event shall any grant, transfer, assignment or acceptance of
     performance pursuant to this Section 3 change, modify or increase
     Borrower's obligations to the Consenting Party or the Consenting Party's
     obligations to the Borrower under the Construction Agreement and any
     related agreement.

     4. Payment Arrangements. The Consenting Party hereby agrees that it shall
make, or cause to be made by any person making payment on its behalf, all
payments due or to become due from it under the Construction Agreement by wire
transfer in U.S. Dollars of same day funds directly to Proceeds Account account
no.105487, in the name of Citibank N.A., at Citibank N.A. or such other account
or accounts at such other bank or banks as are designate from time to time by
the Offshore Collateral Agent.

     5. Miscellaneous.

          (a) This Consent shall be binding upon the Consenting Party, its
     successors and assigns and shall inure, together with the rights and
     remedies of the Offshore Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the
     Borrower and the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of the Senior Lenders
     and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.

          (b) This Consent and the obligations of the Consenting Party hereunder
     shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the date on


                                        5

     Agent stating that all of the Borrower's obligations under the Master
     Security Agreement shall have terminated in accordance with the terms
     thereof.

          (c) No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
     Consent shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed
     by the parties hereto and then such waiver shall be effective only in the
     specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given.

          (d) THIS CONSENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
     THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

          (e) The Consenting Party hereby irrevocably consents and agrees, for
     the benefit of the Offshore Collateral Agent, that any legal action, suit
     or proceeding against it with respect to its obligations, liabilities or
     any other matter under or arising out of or in connection with this Consent
     may be brought in any Federal or State court located in New York County in
     the City of New York and hereby irrevocably accepts and submits to the
     non-exclusive jurisdiction of such court with respect to any such action,
     suit or proceeding. The Consenting Party hereby waives any objection which
     it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid
     actions, suits or proceedings, brought in any such court and hereby further
     waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
     action, suit or proceeding brought therein has been brought in an
     inconvenient forum.

          (f) Each party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted
     by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal

     authorized, executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and
     legally binding agreement, enforceable in accordance with its terms,

     moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
     affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

     are necessary for (i) the execution and delivery by it of the Shareholders
     Agreement and this Consent, (ii) the performance of its obligations

     the grant, transfer and assignment by the Borrower to the Offshore

     all of Borrower's right, title and interest in the Shareholders Agreement
     and all claims resulting from any failure of performance or compliance with
     any of the provisions of the Shareholders Agreement, together with full
     power and authority, in the name of the Borrower, to enforce the
     Shareholders Agreement against the Consenting Parties, it being understood
     and agreed that any enforcement by the Offshore Collateral Agent shall not
     require any further consent from the Consenting Parties or constitute a
     default under the Shareholders Agreement. The Consenting Parties hereby
     irrevocably further agree for the benefit of the Offshore Collateral Agent
     and the Senior Lenders in case of a default under the Shareholders
     Agreement by the Borrower, to accept performance by a Person designated by

<PAGE>

     all other respects be in accordance with the provisions of the Shareholders
     Agreement. In no event shall any grant, transfer, assignment or acceptance

     obligations to the Consenting Parties thereunder.

          (c) The Consenting Parties shall deliver to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent at the address specified in Section 5(j), or at such other address as
     the Offshore Collateral Agent may designate in writing from time to time to
     the Consenting Parties, concurrently with delivery thereof to the Borrower,
     a copy of any material notice, request, demand or other document given by
     the Consenting Parties in connection with the Shareholders Agreement, along
     with notice of any material breach, termination or claim of termination
     under the Shareholders Agreement for which notice to the Borrower is
     required under the Shareholders Agreement.

          (d) The Consenting Parties will not, without the prior written consent
     of the Supermajority Facility Lenders, take any action to amend, supplement
     or otherwise modify the Shareholders Agreement (as in effect on the date
     hereof) unless such amendment or modification would be permitted by Section
     7.12 of the Master Participation Agreement.

          (e) The Consenting Parties and the Borrower hereby further acknowledge
     and agree that the Consenting Parties will not sell, assign, transfer or

     interest in the Shareholders Agreement other than pursuant to a Transfer in
     accordance with the Transfer Restrictions Agreement.

          (f) In the event that the Designee succeeds to the Borrower's interest
     under the Shareholders Agreement, whether by foreclosure or otherwise, the
     Designee may elect (but shall not be required to) by written notice of
     assumption delivered to the Consenting Parties to assume liability for all
     of the Borrower's obligations under the Shareholders Agreement (and the
     Consenting Parties shall not be obligated to recognize any such succession
     until they have each received such written notice of assumption); provided,
     however that such liability shall not include any liability for claims of
     the Consenting Parties against the Borrower arising from the Borrower's
     failure to perform during the period prior to the Offshore Collateral
     Agent's or such Designee's succession to the Borrower's interest in and
     under the Shareholders Agreement. Except as otherwise set forth in the
     immediately preceding sentence, the Designee shall not be liable for the
     performance or observance of any of the obligations or duties of the
     Borrower under the Shareholders Agreement, nor shall the grant of a
     security interest in the Shareholders Agreement by the Borrower to the
     Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of the Senior Lenders give rise to any
     duties or obligations whatsoever on the part of the Offshore Collateral
     Agent owing to any of the Consenting Parties.

     the Senior Lenders of any of the remedies set forth in the Master Security
     Agreement, the Offshore Collateral Agent may, to the extent permitted by
     Article V of the Master Security Agreement, assign its rights and interests
     and the rights and interests of the Borrower under the Shareholders
     Agreement to any purchaser or transferee of the Offshore Collateral, if
     such purchaser or transferee shall (i) assume all of the obligations of the
     Borrower under the Shareholders Agreement and (ii) be, in the reasonable
     opinion of the Consenting Parties, sufficiently creditworthy to perform the
     obligations of the Borrower under the Shareholders Agreement. Upon such
     assignment and assumption, the Senior Lenders shall be relieved of all
     obligations under the Shareholders Agreement arising after such assignment
     and assumption.

          (h) In the event that the Designee shall assume or be liable for any
     obligation under the Shareholders Agreement (as contemplated in clause (f)
     above or otherwise), such liability shall be limited solely to such party's
     interest in the Offshore Collateral (and no officer, director, employee,
     shareholder or agent thereof shall have any liability with respect
     thereto).

     4. Payment Arrangements. The Consenting Parties hereby agree that they
shall make, or cause to be made by any person making payment on its behalf, all
payments due or to become due from it under the Shareholders Agreement by wire
transfer in U.S. Dollars of same day funds directly to Proceeds Account account
no. 105487, in the name of Citibank N.A., at Citibank N.A. or such other account

     remedies of the Offshore Collateral Agent hereunder, to the benefit of the
     Borrower and the Offshore Collateral Agent on behalf of the Senior Lenders
     and their respective successors, transferees and assigns.

          (b) This Consent and the obligations of the Consenting Parties
     hereunder shall terminate and be of no further force and effect on the date

     Master Security Agreement shall have terminated in accordance with the
     terms thereof.

          (c) No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to such terms in
Schedule Z to the Master Security Agreement. The term "Offshore Agreements"
shall mean, collectively, the agreements described in (i) through (v), (xiii),
(xiv), (xvi) through (xxiii) and (xxvi) above. The term "Security Agreements"
shall mean, collectively, the agreements described in (vii) through (ix) [and
(xxvii)] above. The term "Agreements" shall mean, collectively, the agreements
described in (i) through [(xxvi) / (xxvii)] above. The term "Closing Opinion
Peruvian Governmental Approvals" shall mean, collectively, the Environmental

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5.01(g)(i) of the Master
Participation Agreement.

In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, to the extent relevant with respect
to each of the Agreements, that (except as to the Borrower):

(a) the Agreements have been duly authorized by, have been executed and
delivered by, and constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations
of, all of the parties to such documents;

(b) all signatories to the Agreements have been duly authorized;

(c) all of the parties to the Agreements are duly organized and validly existing
and have the power and authority (corporate, limited liability company,
partnership or other) to execute, deliver and perform the Agreements; and

----------
(23) Include only if required to be executed prior to rendering this opinion in
     accordance with the Master Participation Agreement.


                                        3

<PAGE>

(d) each Agreement which is governed by a law other that Peruvian law
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable
against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, pursuant to such applicable
governing law.

In rendering this opinion, we also have assumed that, at the time of so doing,
the officials which executed the Closing Opinion Peruvian Governmental Approvals
were duly authorized and had the power and authority to execute the Closing
Opinion Peruvian Governmental Approvals on behalf of the relevant Peruvian
Governmental Authority.

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity
with authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In
addition, we have examined such corporate records, certificates and other
documents of the Borrower, and such questions of law, as we have considered
necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and
qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1.   The Borrower is a sociedad anonima abierta listed on the Lima Stock
     Exchange, duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
     the laws of Peru. The Borrower has all requisite power to own its property
     and to carry on the Business to the extent and as contemplated by the
     Agreements.

2.   The Borrower has all requisite corporate power to execute and deliver, and
     to incur and perform its obligations under, each of the Agreements.

3.   The execution and delivery by the Borrower, and the incurrence and
     performance by the Borrower, of its obligations under each of the
     Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
     the part of the Borrower.

4.   Each Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and
     constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower,
     enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms.

5.   Under Peruvian conflict of laws principles, the stated choice of New York
     law to govern the Offshore Agreements (other than each of the Construction
     Agreements) and, if applicable, the Promissory Notes, and the stated choice
     of Arizona law to govern the Construction Agreements, will be honored by
     the courts of Peru, except for the limitations of (a) Article 2049 of the
     Peruvian Civil Code, under which provisions of foreign law shall be
     excluded if they are incompatible with international public policy or good
     morals, (b) Article 2088 of the Peruvian Civil Code, under which the
     creation, content and extinction of security interests on tangible assets
     located in Peru is governed by Peruvian law,


                                        4

<PAGE>

     and (c) Article 2.1 of the Insolvency System General Act, Law No. 27809,
     under which any insolvency, bankruptcy, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance
     or transfer involving entities domiciled in Peru shall be ruled by Peruvian
     law.

6.   No authorization, approval or consent, and no filing or registration with,
     any Governmental Authority of Peru (except as has already been obtained or
     accomplished and is in full force and effect) is required on the part of
     the Borrower for (a) the execution or delivery of, or for the incurrence or
     performance of any obligations under, any of the Agreements, (b) the
     payment in Dollars by the Borrower when due (whether at stated maturity, by
     acceleration or otherwise) of the Senior Facility Loans Obligations, and
     (c) the granting by the Borrower of a first priority perfected Lien in
     favor of the Onshore Collateral Agent, for the benefit and on behalf of the
     Secured Parties, purported to be granted by or pursuant to the Security
     Agreements.

7.   The execution and delivery by the Borrower of, the incurrence and
     performance thereby of its obligations under, and the consummation of the
     other transactions contemplated by, any of the Agreements do not and will
     not (a) violate any provision of the organizational documents of the
     Borrower, (b) violate or conflict with any applicable law, rule, regulation
     or decree of Peru, (c) violate or conflict with any treaty or other
     international agreement to which Peru is subject, or (d) except for the
     Liens created pursuant to the Security Agreements, result in the creation
     or imposition of any Lien upon any Project Property pursuant to the terms
     of any of the Agreements.

8.   Each of the Agreements is in proper legal form for the enforcement thereof
     against the Borrower in the courts of Peru, as applicable. No registration,
     notarization or other formality (including, without limitation, payment of
     any stamp or similar tax) is required to be accomplished in Peru (except as
     has already been accomplished and is in full force and effect) for the
     legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of any of
     the Agreements in Peru, as applicable.

     Please note that the admissibility in evidence of the Agreements before any
     Peruvian court requires such documents, if written in English or any
     language other than Spanish, to be officially translated into Spanish by a
     duly authorized public translator in Peru. Such translation may be done at
     the time that enforcement is sought.

9.   The Borrower is subject to civil and commercial law with respect to its
     obligations under each of the Agreements, and the making and performance by
     it of such Agreements constitute private and commercial acts, rather than
     governmental or public acts. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
     properties,


                                        5

<PAGE>

     assets or revenues has any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from
     any legal process (whether through service, notice, attachment prior to
     judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise).

10.  The Security Agreements create a valid and fully perfected first priority
     Lien in favor of the Onshore Collateral Agent, for the benefit and on
     behalf of the Secured Parties, upon the properties and rights purported to
     be covered thereby as security for the obligations of the Borrower,
     superior in right to any other Lien (other than Permitted Liens), and
     enforceable in Peru against the Borrower in accordance with its terms and
     against any trustee in insolvency proceedings and any attaching creditor or
     third party (including a judgment creditor), as may be limited by
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance
     or transfer or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
     creditors generally (and by the possible judicial application of foreign
     laws or governmental action affecting the rights of creditors generally).
     No authorization, registration, filing, notarization, recordation or other
     formality in Peru (except as has already been obtained or accomplished and
     is in full force and effect) is required to be obtained or accomplished,
     and no fee, duty, or tax (except as has already been paid) is required to
     be paid, in each case for the continued perfection and priority of such
     Lien.

11.  Under applicable law of Peru currently in effect, no stamp or other similar
     taxes or levies, imposts, deductions, charges, compulsory loans or
     withholdings whatsoever are or will be imposed, assessed, levied or
     collected from the Borrower or the Senior Facility Lenders by Peru or any
     political subdivision or taxing Governmental Authority thereof or therein
     or on or in respect of any of the Agreements.

12.  The submission by the Borrower to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
     Federal or State Court located in New York County in the City of New York,
     New York, and any appellate court from any thereof, with respect to matters
     arising under or in connection with any of the Offshore Agreements (other
     than each of the Construction Agreements) and, if applicable, the
     Promissory Notes, and the submission by the Borrower to the non-exclusive
     jurisdiction of the Federal or State Court located in the City of Phoenix,
     Arizona, and any appellate court from any thereof, with respect to matters
     arising under or in connection with any of the Construction Agreements,
     pursuant to which the Borrower has so submitted in each case, is valid and
     effective under the laws of Peru, except for the limitations of Article
     2060 of the Peruvian Civil Code, under which such submission shall be
     denied if the controversy concerns matters subject to the exclusive
     jurisdiction of Peruvian courts (i.e., in rem rights related to real estate
     located in Peru, criminal offences in Peru or when the parties have
     expressly or implicitly submitted to


                                        6

<PAGE>

     Peruvian jurisdiction), or if such submission would constitute an abuse of
     law or would contravene Peruvian public policy.

     The Borrower is generally subject to suit in Peru, and its submission to
     the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the cities of Lima, Peru,
     and Arequipa, Peru, as applicable, with respect to matters arising under or
     in connection with any Agreement, is valid and effective.

13.  A final, non-appealable judgment against the Borrower obtained in the
     jurisdiction agreed to under the Offshore Agreements would be recognized,
     conclusive and enforceable in the courts of Peru without re-examination on
     the merits; provided that the following conditions and requirements are
     met:

     (a)  there is a treaty between Peru and the country in which such judgment
          has been rendered, and the provisions of such treaty shall apply;

     (b)  in the absence of a treaty, the reciprocity rule is applicable (such
          reciprocity being presumed), under which a judgment given by a foreign
          competent court will be admissible in the Peruvian courts and will be
          enforceable thereby, except if according to such foreign law (i)
          judgments issued by Peruvian courts are not admissible in such foreign
          country, or (ii) judgments issued by Peruvian courts are subject to
          re-examination by such foreign competent court of the issues dealt
          therein;

     (c)  in either (a) or (b), (i) such judgment does not resolve matters which
          are subject to exclusive jurisdiction of Peruvian courts, (ii) the
          foreign competent court issuing the judgment holds jurisdiction under
          the rules of international conflicts of law and general principles of
          international procedural jurisdiction, (iii) the defendant against
          whom the enforcement is sought has been summoned in accordance with
          the laws of the place in which the action was brought up and a
          reasonable time to appear before the foreign court as well as due
          procedural guarantees to defend the case were granted to the
          defendant, (iv) the foreign judgment has the authority of res judicata
          under the laws of such foreign jurisdiction, (v) there are no pending
          legal proceedings in Peru between the same parties which relate to the
          same matters, started prior to the filing of the complaint that
          concluded with such foreign judgment, (vi) such foreign judgment is
          not compatible with other foreign judgments which meet the
          admissibility and enforceability requirements established by Peruvian
          law which have been previously issued with respect to the same subject
          matter, and (vii) such foreign judgment is not contrary to public
          policy or good morals.


                                        7

<PAGE>

     As of this date, there is no treaty between Peru and the State of New York,
     the State of Arizona or the United States of America on the enforcement of
     foreign judgments. In addition, we have no reason to believe that any
     obligation under the Agreements would be contrary to Peruvian public policy
     and international treaties to which Peru is subject or generally accepted
     principles of international law.

     Assuming that the foreign final judgment complies with the standards set
     forth in this opinion, and in the absence of any condition referred to
     above which would render a foreign judgment unenforceable, the respective
     parties would be entitled to enforce such judgment in Peru by proceedings
     for the enforcement of a foreign final judgment under the laws of Peru.

14.  The arbitration clause of each of the Master Participation Agreement, the
     Operator's Agreement, the SMM Concentrate Sales Agreement, the Concentrate
     Sales Agreement, the Cathodes Sales Agreement and each of the Construction
     Agreements is valid and binding to refer any dispute contemplated
     thereunder to arbitration, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and
     conditions in each case set forth therein. If applicable, a final arbitral
     award rendered by the foreign arbitration tribunal designated in each case
     therein would be recognized and enforced by the courts of Peru in
     accordance with Article 2064 of the Peruvian Civil Code and the General
     Arbitration Act, Law No. 26572, subject to the conditions and limitations
     thereof.

15.  The Senior Facility Lenders are not and will not be deemed resident,
     carrying on business, subject to taxation as such or subject to
     environmental liability in Peru solely by reason of the making of the
     Senior Facility Loans or enforcement in Peru of any of the Agreements to
     which they are a party.

16.  There are no restrictions or requirements which limit the availability or
     transfer of foreign currency for the purpose of the performance by the
     Borrower of its obligations under the Agreements.

17.  The obligations of the Borrower under (a) the Agreements rank and shall
     rank at least pari passu in priority of payment and in all other respects
     with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Borrower
     outstanding at any time, except obligations that are mandatorily preferred
     by law, and (b) the Master Participation Agreement and the Senior Facility
     Loan Agreements rank and shall rank senior to the obligations of the
     Borrower in respect of the Subordinated Loans. No Person holding
     indebtedness of the Borrower may obtain a preference or priority over the
     obligations of the Borrower under the Senior Facility Lenders Financing
     Documents solely by reason of the agreements or instruments evidencing such
     indebtedness being executed before a notary or any other Person,


                                       8

<PAGE>

     provided that we express no opinion with respect to the Transfer
     Restrictions Agreement to which the Borrower is not a party.

18.  Assuming that CT Corporation has, under the laws of the State of New York,
     been duly appointed by the Borrower as its agent to receive service of
     process in the State of New York, service of process made on CT Corporation
     pursuant to such appointment will, under the laws of Peru, be considered
     served personally on the Borrower and satisfy the conditions of Peruvian
     law thereto.

19.  The Core Mining Concessions and the mining concessions identified as
     Tiabaya 4 and Tiabaya 10 are in full force and effect in all material
     respects and the Borrower holds registered title thereto. There are no
     liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances of any nature with
     respect to the Core Mining Concessions and the mining concessions
     identified as Tiabaya 4 and Tiabaya 10 registered in the relevant registry.

20.  The Environmental Impact Study for the Sulfide Project, approved by the
     General Directorate of Mining Environmental Affairs of the Ministry of
     Energy and Mines by means of Directorial Resolution No. 438-2004-MEM/DGAAM,
     dated September 27, 2004, is in full force and effect in all material
     respects.

21.  The permit for the expansion and construction of the Beneficiation
     Concession in respect of the Sulfide Project by the Directorate of Mining
     Promotion of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, dated October 26, 2004, is
     in full force and effect in all material respects.

22.  The SMCV Shares comprise all of the issued and outstanding shares of
     capital stock of the Borrower held by the Shareholders at the date hereof
     and consist of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
     non-assessable shares of Common Stock registered in CAVALI ICLV S.A. and/or
     the share registry of the Borrower, as applicable, as follows:

     [NUMBER OF SHARES AND APPROXIMATE PERCENTAGE OF OVERALL SHARES FOR EACH
     SHAREHOLDER]

In addition, with respect to the Share Pledge Agreement, dated __, among each of
the Shareholders and the Onshore Collateral Agent (the "Share Pledge
Agreement"), and subject to the assumption that each of CCMC and the Sumitomo
Participant is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the country or state of its incorporation, that each of them has all
requisite corporate power to execute and deliver the power of attorney to be
represented in Peru in respect of the Share Pledge Agreement and the
transactions thereunder and that the execution and delivery by each of them, and
incurrence and performance by each of them, of the Share Pledge Agreement


                                        9

<PAGE>

does not and will not (i) violate any provision of its respective organizational
documents nor (ii) violate or conflict with any applicable law, rule, regulation
or decree other than those of Peru, we are of the opinion that:

(A)  Each of CCMC and the Sumitomo Participant has granted sufficient powers of
     attorney for the execution and delivery by each of them, and the incurrence
     and performance by each of them, of its obligations under the Share Pledge
     Agreement.

(B)  The Share Pledge Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
     obligation of each of CCMC and the Sumitomo Participant, enforceable
     against each of them in accordance with its terms.

(C)  The Lien created under the Share Pledge Agreement in favor of the Onshore
     Collateral Agent, for the benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties, in
     respect of the SMCV Shares pledged by each of CCMC and the Sumitomo
     Participant has been perfected and constitutes a valid and fully perfected
     first priority Lien in favor of the Onshore Collateral Agent, for the
     benefit and on behalf of the Secured Parties, upon such SMCV Shares,
     subject to no other equal or prior pledges, liens, security interests,
     rights of reversion, assignments or other encumbrances or rights of others
     whatsoever registered with CAVALI ICLV S.A. and/or the share registry of
     the Borrower, as applicable.

(D)  The execution and delivery by the Shareholders of, the incurrence and
     performance thereby of its obligations under, and the consummation of the
     other transactions contemplated by, the Share Pledge Agreement do not and
     will not (i) violate any provision of the organizational documents of the
     Borrower, (ii) violate or conflict with any applicable law, rule,
     regulation or decree of Peru, or (iii) violate or conflict with any treaty
     or other international agreement to which Peru is subject.

(E)  No authorization, approval or consent, and no filing or registration with,
     any Governmental Authority of Peru is required on the part of either of
     CCMC or the Sumitomo Participant for the execution or delivery of, or for
     the incurrence or performance of any obligations under, the Share Pledge
     Agreement.

(F)  The Share Pledge Agreement is in proper legal form for the enforcement
     thereof against either of CCMC or the Sumitomo Participant in the courts of
     Peru, as applicable. No registration, notarization or other formality
     (including, without limitation, payment of any stamp or similar tax) is
     required to be accomplished in Peru for the legality, validity,
     enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the Share Pledge Agreement
     in Peru, as applicable.


                                       10

(G)  Under applicable law of Peru currently in effect, no stamp or other similar
     taxes or levies, imposts, deductions, charges, compulsory loans or
     withholdings whatsoever are or will be imposed, assessed, levied or
     collected from CCMC, the Sumitomo Participant or the Senior Facility
     Lenders by Peru or any political subdivision or taxing Governmental
     Authority thereof or therein or on or in respect of the Share Pledge
     Agreement.

(H)  The submission by each of CCMC and the Sumitomo Participant to the
     non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the city of Lima, Peru, with
     respect to matters arising under or in connection with the Share Pledge
     Agreement is valid and effective.

We express no opinion with respect to the ability of the Borrower to create and
perfect the industrial pledge referred to in Section 3.09(b)(ii) of the Master
Security Agreement.

The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the laws of Peru and we
do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction. Our opinions

     In connection therewith, we have examined the following documents and

officials, officers and representatives of the PD Parties [and BVN] and other
Persons and such questions of law as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for
the purposes of this opinion. With respect to all Peruvian law matters that

the accuracy of and relied upon, respectively, the opinions of Estudio Rodrigo,
Elias & Medrano Abogados, special Peruvian counsel to the Borrower and the
opinions of Estudio Rodrigo, Elias & Medrano Abogados, special Peruvian counsel
to the Operator, and have made no other

investigation of any corporate records, certificates or other documents relating
to either the Borrower or the Operator. [With respect to all Peruvian law
matters that relate to BVN, we have, with your permission, assumed the accuracy
of and relied upon the opinions of Estudio Aurelio Garcia Sayan Abogados,
special Peruvian counsel to BVN, and have made no other investigation of any
corporate records, certificates or other documents relating to BVN.]

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and the assumptions, qualifications
and limitations hereinafter set forth, we are of the opinion that:

     1. (a) PDC is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of New York.

     (b) The PD Participant is validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

     (c) The PD Buyer is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware.

     2. (a) PDC has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and

authorize its execution and delivery of and performance of its obligations under
the PD Participant Transaction Documents.

     (c) The PD Buyer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize its

obligation of PDC, enforceable against PDC in accordance with its terms.

     (c) Each of the PD Participant New York Transaction Documents constitutes

     (d) Each of the Operator Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Operator, enforceable against the Operator in

     (f) [Each of the BVN Transaction Documents constitutes the valid and

     5. The Master Security Agreement is effective to create a valid security
interest in favor of the Offshore Collateral Agent, for the benefit of the
Senior Facility Lenders, as security for the Senior Facility Loan Obligations in
all of the collateral described therein that is of the type in which a security
interest can be created under Article 9 (the "Article 9 Collateral") of the
Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York as in effect on the date hereof
(the "UCC") to the extent the UCC is applicable to the creation of such security
interest.

                                      * * *

     In rendering the foregoing opinion, we have assumed that: (i) (a) the
Transaction Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
respective parties thereto other than PDC, PD Participant and PD Buyer, (b) each
party to each Transaction Document has been duly organized and, other than PDC,
PD Participant and PD Buyer, is an existing legal entity in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and (c) each of the Transaction
Documents is in consideration for, or relates to, an obligation arising out of a
transaction covering in the aggregate not less than US$1,000,000 and (ii) all
copies of documents reviewed by us are in conformity with the originals thereof,
and that there have been no amendments to such originals, and that any
signatures thereon are genuine and affixed by persons with authority to do so.

     Our opinions set forth above are subject to the effects of (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, reorganization and
moratorium laws and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors'
rights or remedies generally, (ii) general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), (iii) concepts of good faith,
diligence, reasonableness and fair dealing, and standards of materiality, (iv)
limitations on the validity or enforceability of indemnification, contribution
or exculpation under applicable law (including court decisions) or public policy
and (v) possible judicial action giving effect to foreign laws or foreign


                                       5

<PAGE>

governmental or judicial action affecting or relating to the rights or remedies
of creditors. In addition, applicable laws and interpretations may affect the
validity or enforceability of certain provisions of the Transaction Documents,
but such limitations do not, in our opinion, make the remedies provided for
therein inadequate for the practical realization of the principal benefits
intended to be provided thereby (subject to the other qualifications expressed
herein).

     We express no opinion as to (A) the perfection of any security interest
created under any of the Transaction Documents and (B) the creation, validity or
perfection of any security interest, or the validity, binding effect or
enforceability of any Transaction Document, to the extent that such Transaction
Document grants or purports to grant (i) a security interest (a) that is not
governed by the UCC (including but not limited to any such security interest
with respect to (X) copyrights, copyright licenses, patents, patent licenses,
trademarks and trademark licenses or (Y) insurance policies), (b) in commercial
tort claims, letter-of-credit rights, fixtures, cooperative interests, farm
products, as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, (ii) in any property the
terms of or governing which void or prohibit, or are violated by, the granting
of such security interest or (iv) in any claim against the United States, (iii)
a mortgage or other interest in real property, or (c) an agricultural lien.

     Without limiting the foregoing, we express no opinion as to the validity,
binding effect or enforceability of any provision of any Transaction Document
that purports to (i) prohibit any Person from transferring its respective rights
in the collateral described in the Transaction Documents or any proceeds
thereof, as contemplated by Section 9-401 of the UCC, (ii) permit the Onshore
Collateral Agent or the Offshore Collateral Agent to vote or otherwise exercise
any rights with respect to any of the collateral under the Transaction Documents
absent compliance with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations as to
the voting of or other exercise of rights with respect to such collateral, (iii)
waive, release or vary any defense, right or privilege of, or any duties owing
to, any Person to the extent that such waiver, release or variation may be
limited by Section 1-102(3), 9-602 or 9-603 of the UCC or other provisions of
applicable law, (iv) grant a right to collect any amount that a court determines
to constitute post-judgment interest, or a penalty or forfeiture, (v) grant any
right of set-off with respect to any contingent or unmatured obligation, or to
permit any Person purchasing a participation from a Lender to exercise set-off
rights with respect to such participation, (vi) maintain or impose any
obligation to pay any amount in U.S. dollars where a final judgment concerning
such obligation is rendered in another currency, (vii) constitute a waiver of
inconvenient forum or improper venue, (viii) relate to the subject matter
jurisdiction of a court to adjudicate any controversy, (ix) provide for
liquidated damages or otherwise specify or limit damages, liabilities or
remedies, or (x) provide that the parties to any Transaction Document shall
engage in negotiations to replace any illegal, prohibited or unenforceable
provision. In addition, the enforceability of any provision in any Transaction
Document to the effect that (i) the terms thereof may not be waived or modified
except in writing,


                                       6

<PAGE>

(ii) the express terms thereof supersede any inconsistent course of performance
or usage of trade or (iii) certain determinations made by one party shall have
conclusive effect, may be limited under certain circumstances. We wish to call
to your attention that the enforceability of waivers of immunity is subject to
the limitations imposed by the U.S. Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, as
amended.

     Our opinions set forth in paragraph 5 above are limited to Articles 8 and 9
of the UCC and therefore do not address (i) laws of jurisdictions other than New
York, (ii) laws of New York other than Articles 8 and 9 of the UCC or (iii)
collateral of a type not subject to Article 9 of the UCC. We express no opinion
as to what law governs perfection of any security interest granted by the
Transaction Documents. We have assumed with your permission that (i) none of the
Secured Parties has waived, subordinated or agreed with any third party to any
modification of the perfection or priority of any security interest granted by
the Transaction Documents, (ii) the Borrower has sufficient rights in the
collateral described in the Transaction Documents for the security interests
granted thereby to attach. We express no opinion as to the title or any other
interest of the Borrower in or to any of the collateral described in the
Transaction Documents. No security interest will exist with respect to
after-acquired property of the Borrower until the Borrower has rights therein
within the meaning of Section 9-203 of the UCC.

     We express no opinion as to the validity, perfection or priority of such
security interests: (i) with respect to collateral sold, exchanged or otherwise
disposed of by the Borrower; (ii) to the extent such security interests may be
affected by (x) Section 552 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, under which a
bankruptcy court has discretion as to the extent to which post-petition proceeds
may be subject to a lien arising from a security agreement entered into by the
debtor before the commencement of the case, or (y) Section 547(b) of the United
States Bankruptcy Code, relating to the power to avoid a preference; (iii) with
respect to proceeds, to the extent of limitations under Section 9-315 of the UCC
on the perfection of a security interest in proceeds; (iv) as to any collateral
acquired by the party granting such security interest more than four months
after such party changes its name so as to make the relevant financing
statements seriously misleading, unless amendments to such financing statements
indicating the new name of such party are properly filed before the expiration
of such four months; (v) as to any collateral acquired by any Person following
any change in the jurisdiction of organization (within the meaning of Section
9-102(a)(50) of the UCC) of the Borrower unless a new financing statement is
properly filed in the applicable new jurisdiction within the time specified in
Section 9-316 of the UCC; (vi) as to any property subject to a statute,
regulation or treaty of the United States, whose requirements for a security
interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to
such property preempt Section 9-310(a) of the UCC; (vii) as to any goods that
are an accession to, or commingled or processed with, other goods, to the extent
limited by Section 9-335 or 9-


                                       7

<PAGE>

336 of the UCC; or (viii) as to goods of any kind, such as motor vehicles,
subject to certificate of title statutes.

     We call to your attention that (A) the UCC requires periodic filing of
continuation statements in order to maintain the effectiveness of financing
statements filed pursuant thereto, (B) Section 8-107 of the UCC may in certain
circumstances limit the rights of a secured party in respect of any unauthorized
endorsement with respect to certificated securities constituting collateral
under the Transaction Documents not registered in the name of or issued to the
Agent and not originally issued in bearer form, (C) under certain circumstances
Section 9-408 of the UCC limits the enforcement of security interests in
promissory notes, health-care-insurance receivables and general intangibles and
(D) the perfection of the security interests granted by the Transaction
Documents may be limited by (i) rights under Article 2 of the UCC of a seller of
goods as to which the debtor does not yet have possession, (ii) the right of
reservation of a seller of goods under Section 2-505 of the UCC, (iii) the right
of reclamation of a seller of goods on credit under Section 2-702 of the UCC,
(iv) rights of buyers and lessees in the ordinary course to take goods free of
such security interests to the extent provided in Sections 9-320 and 9-321 of
the UCC, (v) rights of licensees in the ordinary course of business to license
general intangibles free of such security interest to the extent provided in
Section 9-321 of the UCC and (vi) rights of a purchaser of chattel paper and
instruments to claim priority over such security interests to the extent
provided in Section 9-330 of the UCC.

     We express no opinion as to the priority of the security interests
purported to be created by the Transaction Documents. Without limiting the
foregoing, we express no opinion as to the priority of any security interest (i)
as against any claims or liens in favor of the United States or any state
thereof, or any federal or state agency, instrumentality or political
subdivision, including but not limited to liens for payment of federal, state or
local taxes that are given priority by operation of law, liens under Title IV of
the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, as amended, or claims arising
under 31 U.S.C. Section 3713, (ii) as against any rights of a person in
possession of proceeds consisting of money or "instruments" (as defined in
Section 9-102(a)(47) of the UCC), (iii) as against liens under Section 4-208 of
the UCC, relating to security interests of a collecting bank, (iv) as against
liens granted under Section 364(d) of the United States Bankruptcy Code,
relating to liens granted by a court after the commencement of a case or (v)
that has been perfected by "control" under Sections 8-106, 9-104, 9-105, 9-106
or 9-107 of the UCC, as against any other security interest in the same property
that has also been perfected by "control."

     Without limiting the foregoing, we express no opinion as to: (i) any
provisions in the Transaction Documents which are too vague to have a clear
remedy, such as obligations to consult, discuss, coordinate or negotiate with
respect to specified matters or any provisions in the Transaction Documents
which constitute an agreement to agree in the future; (ii) any provision in the
PD Offtake Agreements setting forth specifications


                                       8

<PAGE>

for products, forecasting and sampling procedures, pricing formulae and any
other similar provisions, including any provision in the exhibits to such
agreements; and (iii) any provision for payment of damages to the extent such
provision would be considered void as a penalty or not reasonable in light of
the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof
of loss and the inconvenience or nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an
adequate remedy.

     We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
laws of the State of New York, the Delaware General Corporation Law and the
Federal laws of the United States of America, in each case that in our
experience are generally applicable to transactions of this type. In particular
(and without limiting the generality of the foregoing) we express no opinion as
to (a) the laws of any country (other than the Federal laws of the United States
of America), (b) the effect of such laws (whether limiting, prohibitive or
otherwise) on any of the rights or obligations of the Borrower or of any other
party to or beneficiary of any of the Transaction Documents, or (c) whether the
choice of the law of the State of New York as the governing law in any
Transaction Document would be given effect by any court or governmental
authority other than a New York State court. We have assumed, with your
permission, that the execution and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents
by each of the parties thereto and the performance of their respective
obligations thereunder will not be illegal or unenforceable or violate any
fundamental public policy under, and that no such party has entered therein with
the intent of avoiding or a view to violating, applicable law (other than the
laws of the State of New York and Federal laws of the United States of America).
In giving the foregoing opinion, we express no opinion as to the effect (if any)
of any law of any jurisdiction (except the State of New York) in which any
Lender is located that limits the rate of interest that such Lender may charge
or collect.

     The opinions expressed herein are solely for your benefit and, without our
prior consent, neither our opinions nor this opinion letter may be disclosed to
or relied upon by any other person.

     This opinion letter is limited to the matters stated and no opinion is
implied or may be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated herein. The
opinions expressed herein are rendered only as of the date hereof, and we assume
no responsibility to advise you of facts, circumstances, events or developments
which hereafter may be brought to our attention and which may alter, affect or
modify the opinions expressed herein.

     Very truly yours,

and other documents, approvals and such questions of law as we have considered
necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.


                                       4

     In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity
with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies.
When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied upon
certificates of governmental officials and appropriate representatives of the
Obligors, and upon representations made in or pursuant to the Transaction
Documents.

     In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have assumed (without
investigation on our part), with respect to all of the documents referred to in
this opinion letter, that, except to the extent set forth in the opinions
expressed below, as to all parties except the Borrower:

          (a)  such documents have been duly authorized by, and, except as to
               the Obligors, have been duly executed and delivered by, and
               constitute legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of,
               all of the parties to such documents;

          (b)  all signatories to such documents have been duly authorized; and

          (c)  all of the parties to such documents are duly organized and
               validly existing and have the power and authority (corporate,
               partnership or other) to execute, deliver and perform such
               documents.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the comments and
qualifications set forth below, and having considered such questions of law as
we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions expressed below, we are of
the opinion that:

     1. The Borrower is a sociedad anonima abierta listed on the Lima Stock
Exchange, duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the Republic
of Peru. The Borrower has all requisite power to own its property and to carry
on the Business to the extent and as contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

     2. The Borrower has full power and authority to enter into each of the
Transaction Documents in which it is named a party, and has full power and
authority to incur the obligations, to grant to the Senior Facility Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agents, as security for the Senior
Facility Loans Obligations, the security interests in the Collateral purported
to be granted by it in or pursuant to the Master Security Agreement and the
Onshore Security Documents and to incur and perform the obligations provided for
in the Transaction Documents in which it is named as a party.

     3. Each Transaction Document in which the Borrower has been named as a
party has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower, and constitutes the
legal


                                       5

<PAGE>

valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower
in accordance with the terms therein.

     4. Each Transaction Document to which the Borrower is named as a party has
been duly authorized by all requisite action (including by resolution of the
Board of Directors [and Shareholders' Meeting] of the Borrower adopted on [ ]).
Each Peruvian Transaction Document constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Obligor party thereto, enforceable against such Obligor in
accordance with its terms, except (i) that Peruvian courts will disregard the
waiver of protest and (ii) as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or other similar
laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each promissory
note when duly executed and delivered by the Borrower for value in the form
annexed to the applicable Senior Facility Loan Agreement, will constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the
Borrower in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer or
other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally.

     5. The choice of the law of the State of New York to govern the
interpretation of each New York Transaction Document or the law of the State of
Arizona to govern the interpretation of each Arizona Transaction Document would
be upheld as a valid choice of law in any action on the document brought to the
courts of Peru, except where the application of said laws are incompatible with
international public order or good customs.

     6. (a) All authorizations, approvals and consents from, and registrations,
filings and recordations by or with, governmental authorities in Peru or any
political subdivision thereof which are necessary for:

          (i)  the execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of each
               of the Financing Documents to which it is a party, the incurrence
               by the Borrower of the Senior Facility Loans Obligations, (ii)
               the payment by the Borrower when due (whether at stated maturity,
               by acceleration or otherwise) of the Senior Facility Loans
               Obligations, (iii) the granting by the Borrower to the Secured
               Parties, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agents, as
               the case may be, of the security interests in the Collateral
               purported to be granted by or pursuant to the Master Security
               Agreement and the Onshore Security Documents and (iv) the
               performance by the Borrower of its other obligations under the
               Financing Documents, and

          (ii) the execution, delivery and performance by each Obligor, other
               than the Borrower, of each of the Peruvian Transaction Documents
               to which it is a party,


                                       6

<PAGE>

have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect.

     (b) With respect to the Master Participation Agreement and the other
Financing Documents, no registration or approval of the financial terms of the
Senior Facility Loans Obligations to be incurred thereunder is required and no
action in Peru is required in respect of the ability of the Borrower to obtain
Dollars when and as necessary to pay the Senior Facility Loans Obligations when
due or the creation and maintenance of the Collateral as contemplated by the
Master Security Agreement and the Onshore Security Documents.

     (c) All filings, registrations and recordations by or with governmental
authorities in Peru or any political subdivision thereof that are necessary or
advisable with respect to (i) the validity or enforceability in Peru of the
obligations of the Borrower or the rights and remedies of any Senior Facility
Lender, under any of the Peruvian Transaction Documents to which they are party,
or (ii) the admissibility in evidence in a court in Peru of any of the
Transaction Documents, have been made.

     (d) Directorial Resolution No. 438-2004 dated September 27, 2004 which
approves the Enviromental Impact Study; Directorial Resolution No. 1027-2004
dated October 26, 2004 which approves the Beneficiation Concession Expansion and
Construction; and Supreme Decree No. 003-2004-AG dated January 28, 2004 that
reserves water rights in favor of the Borrower are in full force and effect.

     7. No income, stamp or other taxes or levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
compulsory loans or withholdings whatsoever are or will be, under applicable law
in Peru currently in effect, imposed, assessed or levied upon or collected from
the Borrower by Peru or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or
therein or on or in respect of the Financing Documents, the Senior Loans made
thereunder or the Promissory Notes or any payments of principal, interest or
commissions under any thereof, except for (a) the 4.99% withholding tax
currently imposed by Peruvian tax legislation which 4.99% withholding tax rate
will be applied so long as (i) the interest rate borne by the Senior Loans does
not exceed Libor plus 7% or Prime plus 6%, (ii) there is no economic linkage
between the Borrower and the Senior Lender to whom such interest is paid and
(iii) the proceeds, if in cash, of the Senior Loans are received in Peru by the
Borrower and (b) the 19% VAT imposed on interest paid to non-banking or
non-financial or non-credit institutions. Any portion of the interest rates
applying to the Senior Loans that exceed the rates specified in clause (i) above
will be subject to taxation at a 30% withholding tax rate. If the conditions
specified in clauses (ii) or (iii) above are not satisfied, interest on the
relevant Senior Loans will be subject to taxation at a 30% withholding tax rate.
For this purpose, all expenses and commissions, premiums and any other sum
payable in addition to interest agreed upon, paid to the foreign beneficiary,
will also be considered as interest.


                                       7

     8. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of, the performance and
incurrence by the Borrower of its obligations and liabilities under, and the
consummation by the Borrower of the other relevant transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents to which the Borrower is a party, do not and will not
(a) violate any provision of the charter or by-laws of the Borrower, (b) violate
any provision of the Peruvian Corporation Law, (c) violate or conflict with any
and applicable treaty, law, rule or regulation of Peru or any political
subdivision thereof, (d) violate any order, writ, injunction or decree of any
court or governmental or regulatory authority or agency or any arbitral award
applicable to the Borrower of which we have knowledge (after due inquiry) or (e)
result in a breach of, constitute a default under, require any consent under, or
result in the acceleration or required prepayment of any indebtedness pursuant
to the terms of, any agreement or instrument, of which we have knowledge (after
due inquiry) to which the Borrower is a party or by which the Borrower is bound
or to which it is subject, or (except for the Permitted Liens created pursuant
to the Master Participation Agreement and the Onshore Security Documents) result
in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property of the Borrower
pursuant to the terms of any such agreement or instrument.

     9. The execution and delivery by the Operator, each Parent Company and each
Shareholder of, the performance and incurrence by such Obligor of its
obligations and liabilities under, and the consummation by such Obligor of the
other transactions contemplated by the Peruvian Transaction Documents to which
such Obligor is a party do not and will not violate any applicable treaty, law,
rule or regulation of Peru or any political subdivision thereof.

     10. To our knowledge (after due inquiry), (a) there are no actions, suits
or legal or arbitral proceeding, or any proceedings or investigation, at law or
equity, by or before any Peruvian governmental or regulatory authority or
agency, now pending, or threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of
its properties, or any existing default by the Borrower under any applicable
order, writ, injunction or decree of any Peruvian governmental or regulatory
authority to be applicable to the Borrower, other than as disclosed in writing
to the Senior Facility Lenders on or prior to the date hereof and (b) there are
no competing existing claims to the Material Concessions reported in El Peruano
within the twelve month period immediately preceding the date of this Opinion or
registered in the Book of Mining Rights of the Public Records Office.

     11. The SMCV Shares comprise all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Borrower held by or on behalf of the Shareholders as of the
date hereof and consist of duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Common Stock held as follows: [DESCRIBE TYPE & NUMBER
OF SHARES FOR EACH SHAREHOLDER.] The SMCV Shares have been duly and validly
issued and are fully paid and non assessable and are duly registered in CAVALI
ICLV S.A. and/or the share registry of the Borrower, as applicable, in the name
of the Shareholders.


                                       8

<PAGE>

     12. (a) The Borrower has good and valid title to the real and personal
property and water rights informed by the Borrower to be owned by it. There are
no liens, security interests, charges or encumbrances of any nature registered
in the relevant registry, and to the best of our knowledge (after due inquiry)
no averse or competing claims, against said properties of the Borrower except
Permitted Liens and any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraph 10
hereinabove.

     (b) Each of the Material Concessions is validly granted to and owned by the
Borrower, is duly registered in the name of the Borrower, and is subject to no
defects, irregularities, easements, restrictions on use, liens or encumbrances
(other than Permitted Liens created pursuant to the Master Participation
Agreement and the Onshore Security Documents) or rights of others. Currently, no
Person other than the Borrower and the Onshore Collateral Agent has any right,
title or interest, in, to or under the Material Concessions.

     13. The obligations of the Borrower to the Senior Lenders under the Master
Participation Agreement, Promissory Notes and other Transaction Documents will
at all times rank in right of payment (a) pari passu with or senior to all other
obligations of the Borrower, except for claims in Peru for employee benefits and
social security contributions and (b) senior to the obligations of the Borrower
in respect of the Subordinated Loans. No Person holding indebtedness of the
Borrower may obtain a preference or priority over the obligations of the
Borrower under the Transaction Documents solely by reason of the agreements or
instruments evidencing such indebtedness being executed before a notary or any
other Person.

     14. Each of the Onshore Security Documents to which the Borrower is a party
purported to create a garantia real pursuant to the laws of Peru creates in Peru
a valid and fully perfected first and prior security interest in and lien upon
the properties, rights and revenues purported to be covered thereby as security
for the Senior Loans Obligations, subject to no other equal or prior mortgages,
pledges, liens, security interests, rights of reversion, assignments or other
encumbrances or rights of others whatsoever, enforceable in Peru against the
Borrower and except for claims in Peru for employee benefits and social security
contributions against any trustee, receiver or intervenor in bankruptcy, any
attaching creditor and all other third parties, in accordance with its terms;
and no further authorization, registration, filing, notarization, recordation or
other formality in Peru is required to be obtained or accomplished, and no fee,
duty or tax is required to be paid, for the maintenance, preservation and
continued perfection and priority of such security interests and liens.

     15. The Share Pledge Agreement in respect of SMCV Shares creates in Peru a
valid and fully perfected first rank security interest in and lien upon the SMCV
Shares as security for the Senior Facility Loans Obligations, subject to no
other equal or prior mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests, rights of
reversion, assignments or other encumbrances or rights of others whatsoever,
enforceable in Peru against the Shareholder


                                       9

<PAGE>

party thereto and against any trustee, receiver or intervenor in bankruptcy, any
attaching creditor and all other third parties, in accordance with its terms;
and no further authorization, registration, filing, notarization, recordation or
other formality in Peru is required to be obtained or accomplished, and no fee,
duty or tax is required to be paid, for the maintenance, preservation and
continued perfection and priority of such security interests and liens.

     16. The Borrower is subject to civil and commercial law with respect to its
obligations under each of the Transaction Documents, and the making and
performance by it of such Transaction Documents constitute private and
commercial acts, rather than governmental or public acts. Neither of the
Borrower nor any Obligor nor any of their respective assets, properties or
revenues, has in Peru any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any
legal process in Peru (whether through service, notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise).

     17. Each of the Transaction Documents is in proper legal form for the
effectiveness and enforcement thereof in the courts of Peru, except that an
official translation to Spanish of each Transaction Document which is not
executed in the Spanish language would be required for purposes of enforcement
proceedings in Peru.

     18. (a) The submission by the Borrower to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any Federal or State Court located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, with respect to matters arising under or in connection with any
Transaction Document (other than the Peruvian Transaction Documents) is valid
and effective under the laws of Peru. The submission by the Borrower to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court located in the City of Phoenix, State of
Arizona with respect to matters arising under or in connection with any
Transaction Documents (other than the New York Transaction Document and the
Peruvian Transaction Documents) is valid and effective under the laws of Peru.

     (b) The Borrower is generally subject to suit in Peru, and its submission
to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the city of Lima, Peru, with
respect to matters arising under or in connection with any Transaction Document,
is valid and effective.

     (c) A final judgment against the Borrower for the payment of money obtained
in any such court in the State of New York pursuant to service of process on an
agent of the Borrower in the manner specified in the Master Participation
Agreement (other than the Onshore Security Documents) providing for such service
of process would be recognized, conclusive and enforceable in the courts of Peru
without reconsideration on the merits provided that: (i) there is in effect a
treaty between the country where said foreign court sits and the Republic of
Peru regarding the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments or, in the
absence of such treaty and (ii) the following requirements are met:


                                       10

<PAGE>

               (A)  the judgment does not resolve matters under the exclusive
                    jurisdiction of Peruvian courts;

               (B)  such court had jurisdiction under its own conflicts of law
                    rules and under general principles of international
                    procedural jurisdiction;

               (C)  the defendant was served in accordance with the laws of the
                    place where the procedure took place, was granted a
                    reasonable opportunity to appear before such foreign court,
                    and was guaranteed due process rights;

               (D)  the judgment has the status of res judicata in the
                    jurisdiction of the court rendering such judgment;

               (E)  there is no pending litigation in Peru between the same
                    parties for the same dispute, which shall have been
                    initiated before the commencement of the proceeding that
                    concluded with the foreign judgment;

               (F)  the judgment is not incompatible with another judgment which
                    fulfills the requirements of recognition and enforceability
                    established by Peruvian law which was rendered first;

               (G)  the judgment is not contrary to public order or good morals;
                    and

               (H)  it is not proven that such foreign court denies enforcement
                    of Peruvian judgments or engages in a review of the merits
                    thereof.

     We have no reason to believe that any obligation under the Transaction
Documents would be contrary to Peruvian public policy and international treaties
binding upon Peru or generally accepted principles of international law.

     Assuming such a foreign final judgment complied with the standards set
forth in this paragraph 18(c), and in the absence of any condition referred to
above which would render a foreign judgment unenforceable, the Secured Parties
would be entitled to enforce such judgment in Peru by proceedings for the
enforcement of a foreign final judgment under the laws of Peru.

     19. The subordination terms set out in Exhibit A to the Completion
Guarantee are enforceable in Peru.


                                       11

<PAGE>

     20. Under the law of Peru, a foreign corporation is not required solely as
a lender holding Indebtedness, or liens under any security agreement covering
personal property, to procure a certificate of authority to transact business or
otherwise qualify to do business in Peru. As such, none of the Secured Parties
nor the Administrative Agent, solely by reason of the making of the extensions
of credit contemplated by the Financing Documents or the execution and delivery
by the Borrower or the Obligors of the Financing Documents, will (a) be required
to qualify to do business in Peru or to comply with the requirements of any
foreign registration or qualification law of Peru, (b) be subject to taxation by
Peru or any political subdivision of Peru or (c) be required, preceding
enforcement of the Financing Documents, to make any filing with any court or
other judicial or administrative body in or of Peru in order to carry out any of
the transactions contemplated by the Financing Documents.

     21. Pursuant to Legislative Resolution No. 24810, Peru has ratified, and
has enacted all legislation necessary under the laws of Peru to implement the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral, adopted in
June 10th, 1958 in New York. We are not aware of any public policy of Peru that
would prevent the recognition and enforcement of any arbitral award rendered
pursuant to the Master Participation Agreement, Master Security Agreement or any
other Financing Document. The arbitration provisions in Section 12.17 of the
Master Participation Agreement and Section 9.16 of the Completion Guarantee are
valid and binding to refer any dispute contemplated thereunder to arbitration,
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in such
Sections.

     22. The Senior Facility Lenders are not and will not be deemed resident,
carrying on business, subject to taxation as such or subject to environmental
liability in Peru solely by reason of the making of the Senior Facility Loans or
enforcement in Peru of any of the Transaction Documents to which they are a
party.

     23. There are no restrictions or requirements which limit the availability
or transfer of foreign currency for the purpose of the performance by the
Borrower of its obligations under the Transaction Documents.

     24. Under the laws of Peru, the perfection of non-possessory security
interests over the Proceeds Account or the rights of the Borrower under the SMM
Concentrate Sales Agreement, the PD Concentrate Sales Agreement, the PD Cathode
Sales Agreement, the Construction Agreements, the Operator's Agreement and the
Shareholders Agreement, do not require filing, recording or registration as a
condition or result of such security interest being created.

     The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the laws of Peru
and we do not express any opinion as to the laws of any other jurisdiction.
Unless otherwise indicated, our opinions are based upon the facts in existence
and the laws in effect as of the date hereof and we disclaim any obligation to
update our opinions with respect to any


                                       12

changes in such facts or laws that may come to our attention after delivery of
this opinion.

     At the request of our clients, this opinion letter is provided to you by us
in our capacity as counsel to the Senior Facility Lenders, and this opinion
letter may not be relied upon by any Person for any purpose other than in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents
without, in each instance, our prior written consent.

                                        Very truly yours,

Re: Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          We have acted as special New York counsel to Japan Bank for
International Cooperation ("JBIC"), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation ("SMBC")
in its own capacity and as JBIC Agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd.
("BOT-M"), KfW, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ("RBS"), The Bank of Nova Scotia
("Scotia Capital"), Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. ("Mizuho") and CALYON New York
Branch ("Calyon"), in it own capacity and as Administrative Agent (in such
capacity, the "Administrative Agent"), in connection with the execution and
delivery of Master Participation Agreement dated as of September 30, 2005 (the
"Master Participation Agreement" ) among Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A., a
sociedad anonima abierta organized under the laws of Peru (the "Borrower"),
JBIC, SMBC, BOT-M, KfW, Calyon in its own capacity and as Administrative Agent,
RBS, Scotia Capital and Mizuho. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings given to them in Schedule Z to the Master Security
Agreement (as defined in the Master Participation Agreement). As used herein,
"UCC" means the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the State of New York.

          In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined the
following agreements and documents (collectively referred to as the "New York
Documents"):

          (i)  the Master Participation Agreement;

          (ii) the Master Security Agreement;

          (iii) the Completion Guarantee;

<PAGE>

          (iv) the Transfer Restrictions Agreement;

          (v)  the KfW Loan Agreement; and

          (vi) the Commercial Banks Loan Agreement.

          We have assumed for purposes of our opinions hereinafter set forth
that the New York Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered
by, and (except to the extent set forth below as to the Borrower, SMM, SC, the
Sumitomo Participant, BVN, PDC and CCMC) constitute the legal, valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of, the respective parties thereto; that each of the
respective parties thereto is duly organized and validly existing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its organization and has full power, authority and legal
right to make and perform each New York Document to which it is a party, and
that all authorizations, approvals or consents of (including without limitation
all foreign exchange control approvals), and all filings or registrations with,
any governmental or regulatory authority or agency required for the making and
performance of each of the New York Documents by the respective parties thereto
have been obtained or made and are in effect; and that the making and
performance of each of the New York Documents by the respective parties thereto
do not, in the case of any such party, contravene, and such agreements are not
invalid or unenforceable under, the law of the jurisdiction (other than the
State of New York) of organization of such party.

          In rendering the opinions expressed below, we have examined such
documents and papers as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
hereinafter expressed. In such examination we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures, the authenticity of documents submitted to us as originals and
the conformity with the authentic original documents of all documents submitted
to us as copies. With respect to certain matters of fact, we have relied upon
representations of the parties to the New York Documents, including, without
limitation, the representations set forth in the New York Documents.

          Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the
comments and qualifications set forth below, and having considered such
questions of law as we have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
expressed below, we are of the opinion that:

          1. The Master Participation Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally, and to the possible judicial
application of foreign laws or governmental action affecting the rights of
creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of the Master


                                       2

<PAGE>

Participation Agreement is subject to the application of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),
including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts
of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

          2. The Master Security Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance
or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors generally, and to the possible judicial application of
foreign laws or governmental action affecting the rights of creditors generally,
and except as the enforceability of the Master Security Agreement is subject to
the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation
(i) the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or
any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness,
good faith and fair dealing.

          3. Each of the KfW Loan Agreement and Commercial Banks Loan Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar
laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and to the
possible judicial application of foreign laws or governmental action affecting
the rights of creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of each of
such agreements is subject to the application of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),
including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts
of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

          4. The Completion Guarantee constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of each of SMM, SC, BVN and PDC, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent conveyance or transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
or affecting the rights of creditors generally, and to the possible judicial
application of foreign laws or governmental action affecting the rights of
creditors generally, and except as the enforceability of the Completion
Guarantee is subject to the application of general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law),
including without limitation (i) the possible unavailability of specific
performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable remedy and (ii) concepts
of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing.

          5. The Transfer Restrictions Agreement constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of each of the SMM Participant, BVN, CCMC, SMM, SC and PDC,


                                       3

<PAGE>

enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally, and to the possible judicial application of foreign laws or
governmental action affecting the rights of creditors generally, and except as
the enforceability of the Transfer Restrictions Agreement is subject to the
application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law), including without limitation (i) the possible
unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or any other equitable
remedy and (ii) concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair
dealing.

          6. The Master Security Agreement is effective to create in favor of
the Offshore Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, as
security for the Secured Obligations, valid security interests (to the extent
the UCC is applicable thereto) in the right, title and interest of the Borrower
(a) in, to and under the SMM Concentrate Sales Agreement, the PD Concentrate
Sales Agreement and the PD Cathodes Sales Agreement, (b) in the Proceeds
Account, (c) in and to each of the Construction Agreements, the Operator's
Agreement and the Shareholders Agreement. We note that (i) that such security
interest will continue in such collateral after disposition thereof and in any
proceeds (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(64) of the UCC) thereof only to the
extent provided in Section 9-315 of the UCC and (ii) in the case of property
which becomes collateral after the date hereof, the security interests therein
referred to above will not attach or be enforceable until such time as the
debtor or other grantor has rights in such property, and Section 552 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code limits the extent to which property acquired by a debtor
or other grantor after the commencement of a case under the Federal Bankruptcy
Code may be subject to a security interest arising from a security agreement
entered into by the debtor or other grantor before the commencement of such
case. We express no opinion herein as to whether the Borrower has any right,
title or interest in or to any of the properties or rights in which security
interests are, or are purported to be, granted by the Master Security Agreement,
or as to the perfection of any such security interest (except expressly set
forth in paragraph 7 below) or as to the priority of any such security interest.

          7. The security interest created by the Master Security Agreement in
the Borrower's right, title and interest, if any, in and to the Proceeds Account
is perfected by execution and delivery of the Master Security Agreement by the
parties thereto. As to security interests referred to in paragraph 6 hereof
created by the Master Security Agreement that are not so perfected, (a) if Peru
constitutes a filing jurisdiction as hereinafter defined (as to which we express
no opinion), and the Borrower's place of business or (if it has more than one
place of business) chief executive office is in Peru, under Section 9-301 of the
UCC the local law of Peru governs perfection, the effect of perfection or
non-perfection and the priority of such security interest, and (b) if Peru does
not constitute such a filing jurisdiction, (i) the Borrower will be deemed to be
located in


                                       4

<PAGE>

the District of Columbia for purposes of Article 9 of the UCC, (ii) under
Section 9-301 of the UCC the local law of the District of Columbia governs
perfection, the effect of perfection or non-perfection and the priority of the
security interest created in the Borrower's rights, title and interest in and to
the collateral described by the Master Security Agreement and (iii) pursuant to
Section 9-501 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in the District of
Columbia, the filing of an appropriate financing statement in the Recorder of
Deeds of the District of Columbia will cause such security interests to be
perfected. As used herein, "filing jurisdiction" means a jurisdiction whose law
generally requires information concerning the existence of a non-possessory
security interest to be made generally available in a filing, recording or
registration system as a condition or result of the security interest's taking
priority over the rights of a lien creditor (as defined in Section 9-102(a)(52)
of the UCC) with respect to the collateral referred to in paragraph 6 hereof.

          Our opinions in paragraphs 2 and 6 above are subject to possible
limitations on the exercise of remedial or procedural provisions contained in
the Master Security Agreement, but such limitations do not, in our opinion (but
subject to the other comments and qualifications set forth in this opinion
letter), make the remedies and procedures that would be afforded to the Offshore
Collateral Agent or the Secured Parties inadequate for the practical realization
of the benefits intended to be provided by the Master Security Agreement. We
further point out that provisions of the New York Documents which permit the
Offshore Collateral Agent, the Secured Parties or a Senior Facility Lender to
take actions or make determinations or require payments under indemnity and
similar provisions may be subject to a requirement that such actions be taken
and such determinations be made on a reasonable basis and in good faith and may
be limited by laws limiting the enforceability of provisions exculpating or
exempting a party from, or requiring indemnification of a party for, liability
for its own action or inaction, to the extent such action or inaction involves
gross negligence, recklessness or willful or unlawful conduct.

          The foregoing opinions are also subject to the following comments and
qualifications:

               (a) We express no opinion as to (i) the provisions of Section
     12.16(a) of the Master Participation Agreement, and similar provisions of
     any of the other New York Documents, to the extent such provisions relate
     to the subject matter jurisdiction of United States Federal courts to
     adjudicate any matter under or arising out of or in connection with the New
     York Documents or Senior Facility Loans Obligations or to a waiver of
     inconvenient forum with respect to proceedings in any United States Federal
     Court located in New York County in the City of New York; (ii) Section
     10.04(b) of the Master Participation Agreement, and similar provisions of
     any of the other New York Documents; (iii) the provisions of Section 12.24
     of the Master Participation Agreement, and similar provisions of any of the
     other New York Documents, to the extent such


                                       5

<PAGE>

     provisions relate to immunity acquired after the date of the execution and
     delivery of the New York Documents; or (iv) the enforceability of
     provisions of the New York Documents which prohibit transfers of rights in
     property subject to a security interest thereunder.

               (b) We express no opinion as to (i) the enforceability of any
     provision of a New York Document calling for payments to be made without
     set-off or counterclaim for any reason whatsoever; (ii) Section 13.08 of
     the KfW Loan Agreement and Section 11.11 of the Commercial Banks Loan
     Agreement; or (iii) any promissory note provided for in any Senior Facility
     Loan Agreement.

               (c) We express no opinion as to the creation or perfection of any
     security interest in any portion of the Collateral to the extent that,
     pursuant to Section 9-109(c) or (d) of the UCC, Article 9 of the UCC does
     not apply thereto.

               (d) We express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions
     in the New York Documents to the effect that terms may not be waived or
     modified except in writing may be limited under certain circumstances.

               (e) We express no opinion with respect to the effect of the laws
     of any jurisdiction in which any Senior Facility Lender is located (other
     than New York) that limits the interest, fees or other charges it may
     impose for the loan or use of money or other credit.

               (f) For purposes of paragraph 7 above, we assume that each
     endorsement, instruction and entitlement order, as such terms are defined
     in Section 8-102(a) of the UCC, is effective in accordance with Section
     8-107 of the UCC; we express no opinion as to the effect of any rule
     adopted by any clearing corporation, as defined in Section 8-102(a) of the
     UCC, governing rights and obligations among such clearing corporation and
     its participants; our opinion with respect to any security entitlement is
     subject to Part 5 of Article 8 of the UCC; and we express no opinion as to
     the creation, perfection or priority of any security interest in any
     obligations of the Government of the United States or any agency or
     instrumentality thereof except for obligations subject to the Revised
     Book-Entry Rules as defined in Annex 1 hereto.

          With respect to our opinion in paragraphs 1 through 6 above, we note
that under Section 12.17 of the Master Participation Agreement, and under
provisions of the Completion Guarantee, certain particular disputes arising
thereunder are to be settled by arbitration. Although there can be no assurance
that the arbitrators will apply principles of New York law in resolving any such
dispute or in rendering any award and, if they do not, the failure to apply
principles of New York law will not be a basis for a court vacating such award,
we have, with your permission, nevertheless assumed in rendering


                                       6

<PAGE>

our opinions above that the arbitrators will properly apply principles of New
York law in arriving at their award.

          We wish to point out that the acquisition by the Borrower after the
initial extension of credit under the New York Documents of an interest in
property that becomes subject to the lien of the Master Security Agreement may
constitute a voidable preference under Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code.

          This opinion is provided to you by us as special New York counsel to
the addressees noted above pursuant to Section 5.01(g)(iv) of the Master
Participation Agreement and may not be relied upon by any other person or for
any purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
New York Documents without, in each instance, our prior written consent.

          We are members of the bar of the State of New York and we do not
herein express any opinion as to any matters governed by any laws other than the
laws of the State of New York, the federal laws of the United States, and for
purposes of paragraph 7(iii) above, the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in
the District of Columbia, and we do not express any opinion as to the law of any
other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing, we do not hold ourselves out
as experts on, or purport to advise on, the laws of Peru.

                                        Very truly yours,

TO THE PARTIES LISTED ON
THE ATTACHED SCHEDULE I

          Re: Cerro Verde - Project Finance

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as special counsel to Citibank, N.A., as Trustee and Offshore
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties (the "Trustee") in
connection with the execution of the Master Security Agreement, dated as of
September 30, 2005 (the "Agreement"), among Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A.,
as Borrower, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, as a Senior Facility
Lender, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as a Lead JBIC Arranger and Global
Coordinator, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., as a Lead JBIC Arranger, KfW,
as a Senior Facility Lender, CALYON New york Branch, as a Senior Facility
Lender, Lead Arranger and Global Coordinator, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, as
a Senior Facility Lender and Lead Arranger, The Bank of Nova Scotia, as a Senior
Facility Lender and Lead Arranger, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., as a Senior
Facility Lender and Lead Arranger, CALYON New York Branch, as Administrative
Agent, Citibank del Peru S.A., as Onshore Collateral Agent and Citibank N.A., as
Offshore Collateral Agent and the Trustee.

     Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings
assigned to them in the Agreement.

     In rendering the opinions set forth below, we have examined the originals,
or copies certified to our satisfaction, of such agreements, documents,
certificates and other statements of government officials and corporate officers
of the Trustee and other papers as we deemed relevant and necessary as a basis
for such opinions and have relied as to factual matters on representations,
warranties and other statements therein. In such examination, we have assumed
the genuineness of all signatures (other than the Trustee) and the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity with the
originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. We have also assumed the
due authorization, execution and delivery of instruments and agreements by the
parties (other than the Trustee) thereto, and the authority and existence of
such parties other than the Trustee.

<PAGE>

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that as of
the date hereof:

          1.   The Trustee has (a) been duly incorporated, is validly existing
               and in good standing as a national banking association under the
               laws of the United States of America, (b) the corporate power and
               authority to enter into, and to take all action required of it
               under, and to incur and perform all obligations provided for in
               the Agreement and (c) taken all necessary corporate action to
               authorize the execution and delivery of the Agreement and the
               performance of its obligations thereunder.

          2.   The Agreement has been duly authorized and duly executed and
               delivered by the Trustee.

          3.   The Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
               Trustee, enforceable against the Trustee, in accordance with its
               terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by (i)
               bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws
               affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, as such
               laws would apply in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
               reorganization or similar occurrence affecting the Trustee, as
               the case may be, and (ii) general principles of equity
               (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a
               proceeding in equity or at law).

          4.   The execution and delivery of the Agreement by the Trustee and
               the performance by the Trustee of its terms do not conflict with
               or result in a violation of (i) any law or regulation governing
               the banking or trust powers of the Trustee or (ii) any of the
               terms, conditions or provisions of the constitutive documents of
               the Trustee.

          5.   No approval, consent, authorization or other action by, or filing
               with, any governmental authority or agency having jurisdiction
               over the banking or trust powers of the Trustee is required in
               connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the
               Trustee of the terms of the Agreement.

          6.   The Trustee has duly accepted the trusts intended to be created
               by the Agreement.

     We are members of the New York Bar and do not hold ourselves out as experts
on, nor do we express any opinion as to, the laws of any jurisdiction other than
the laws


                                        2

of the State of New York and the Federal laws of the United States. This opinion

Schedule Z to the Master Security Agreement, dated __, among the Borrower, the
Senior Facility Lenders, the Lead JBIC Arrangers, the Global Coordinators, the
Lead Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Trustee, the Offshore Collateral
Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent.

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5.01(g)(vii) of the Master
Participation Agreement.

In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, to the extent relevant with respect
to each of the Agreements, that:

(a)  the Consent and Agreement has been duly authorized by, has been executed
     and delivered by, and constitutes legal, valid, binding and enforceable
     obligations of, the Offshore Collateral Agent;

<PAGE>

(b)  all signatories to the Consent and Agreement on behalf of the Offshore
     Collateral Agent have been duly authorized;

(c)  the Offshore Collateral Agent is duly organized and validly existing and
     has the power and authority (corporate, limited liability company,
     partnership or other) to execute, deliver and perform the Consent and
     Agreement; and

(d)  each Agreement which is governed by a law other that Peruvian law
     constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Operator,
     enforceable against the Operator in accordance with its terms, pursuant to
     such applicable governing law.

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity
with authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In
addition, we have examined such corporate records, certificates and other
documents of the Borrower and the Operator, an executed copy of each of the
Master Participation Agreement and the Master Security Agreement, and such
questions of law, as we have considered necessary or appropriate for the
purposes of this opinion.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and
qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1.   The Operator is a sociedad anonima cerrada duly incorporated, validly
     existing and in good standing under the laws of Peru.

2.   The Operator has all requisite corporate power to execute and deliver, and
     to incur and perform its obligations under, each of the Agreements.

3.   The execution and delivery by the Operator, and the incurrence and
     performance by the Operator, of its obligations under each of the
     Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
     the part of the Operator.

4.   Each Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Operator and
     constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Operator,
     enforceable against the Operator in accordance with its terms.

5.   Under Peruvian conflict of laws principles, the stated choice of New York
     law to govern the Agreements will be honored by the courts of Peru, except
     for the limitations of (a) Article 2049 of the Peruvian Civil Code, under
     which provisions of foreign law shall be excluded if they are


                                        2

<PAGE>

     incompatible with international public policy or good morals, (b) Article
     2088 of the Peruvian Civil Code, under which the creation, content and
     extinction of security interests on tangible assets located in Peru is
     governed by Peruvian law, and (c) Article 2.1 of the Insolvency System
     General Act, Law No. 27809, under which any insolvency, bankruptcy,
     moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or transfer involving entities domiciled
     in Peru shall be ruled by Peruvian law.

6.   No authorization, approval or consent, and no filing or registration with,
     any Governmental Authority of Peru (except as has already been obtained or
     accomplished and is in full force and effect) is required on the part of
     the Operator (a) for the execution or delivery of, or for the incurrence or
     performance of any obligations under, any of the Agreements, or (b) to
     create or to perfect the security interest in the Operator's Agreement and
     the proceeds thereof purported to be granted by the Borrower for the
     benefit of the Secured Parties under Section 3.03 of the Master Security
     Agreement.

7.   The execution and delivery by the Operator of, the incurrence and
     performance thereby of its obligations under, and the consummation of the
     other transactions contemplated by, any of the Agreements do not and will
     not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the organizational
     documents of the Operator, (b) violate or conflict with any applicable law,
     rule, regulation or decree of Peru, (c) violate or conflict with any treaty
     or other international agreement to which Peru is subject, or (d) result in
     the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant
     to the terms of any of the Agreements.

8.   Each of the Agreements is in proper legal form for the enforcement thereof
     against the Operator in the courts of Peru, as applicable. No registration,
     notarization or other formality (including, without limitation, payment of
     any stamp or similar tax) is required to be accomplished in Peru (except as
     has already been accomplished and is in full force and effect) for the
     legality, validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of any of
     the Agreements in Peru, as applicable.

     Please note that the admissibility in evidence of the Agreements before any
     Peruvian court requires such documents to be officially translated into
     Spanish by a duly authorized public translator in Peru. Such translation
     may be done at the time that enforcement is sought.


                                        3

<PAGE>

9.   The submission by the Operator to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
     Federal or State Court located in New York County in the City of New York,
     and any appellate court from any thereof, with respect to matters arising
     under or in connection with any of the Agreements, is valid and effective
     under the laws of Peru, except for the limitations of Article 2060 of the
     Peruvian Civil Code, under which such submission shall be denied if the
     controversy concerns matters subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
     Peruvian courts (i.e., in rem rights related to real estate located in
     Peru, criminal offences in Peru or when the parties have expressly or
     implicitly submitted to Peruvian jurisdiction), or if such submission would
     constitute an abuse of law or would contravene Peruvian public policy.

10.  A final, non-appealable judgment against the Operator obtained in the
     jurisdiction agreed to under the Agreements would be recognized, conclusive
     and enforceable in the courts of Peru without re-examination on the merits;
     provided that the following conditions and requirements are met:

     (a)  there is a treaty between Peru and the country in which such judgment
          has been rendered, and the provisions of such treaty shall apply;

     (b)  in the absence of a treaty, the reciprocity rule is applicable (such
          reciprocity being presumed), under which a judgment given by a foreign
          competent court will be admissible in the Peruvian courts and will be
          enforceable thereby, except if according to such foreign law (i)
          judgments issued by Peruvian courts are not admissible in such foreign
          country, or (ii) judgments issued by Peruvian courts are subject to
          re-examination by such foreign competent court of the issues dealt
          therein;

     (c)  in either (a) or (b), (i) such judgment does not resolve matters which
          are subject to exclusive jurisdiction of Peruvian courts, (ii) the
          foreign competent court issuing the judgment holds jurisdiction under
          the rules of international conflicts of law and general principles of
          international procedural jurisdiction, (iii) the defendant against
          whom the enforcement is sought has been summoned in accordance with
          the laws of the place in which the action was brought up and a
          reasonable time to appear before the foreign court as well as due
          procedural guarantees to defend the case were granted to the
          defendant, (iv) the foreign judgment has the authority of res judicata
          under the laws of such foreign jurisdiction, (v) there are no pending
          legal proceedings in Peru between the


                                       4

<PAGE>

          same parties which relate to the same matters, started prior to the
          filing of the complaint that concluded with such foreign judgment,
          (vi) such foreign judgment is not compatible with other foreign
          judgments which meet the admissibility and enforceability requirements
          established by Peruvian law which have been previously issued with
          respect to the same subject matter, and (vii) such foreign judgment is
          not contrary to public policy or good morals.

     As of this date, there is no treaty between Peru and the State of New York
     or the United States of America on the enforcement of foreign judgments. In
     addition, we have no reason to believe that any obligation under the
     Agreements would be contrary to Peruvian public policy and international
     treaties to which Peru is subject or generally accepted principles of
     international law.

     Assuming that the foreign final judgment complies with the standards set
     forth in this opinion, and in the absence of any condition referred to
     above which would render a foreign judgment unenforceable, the respective
     parties would be entitled to enforce such judgment in Peru by proceedings
     for the enforcement of a foreign final judgment under the laws of Peru.

The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the laws of Peru and we
do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction. Our opinions
set forth herein are based upon the facts in existence and laws in effect as of
the date hereof and we expressly disclaim any obligation to update our opinions
herein with respect to any changes in such facts or laws that may come to our
attention after delivery of this opinion.

This opinion may not be relied upon by any Person other than you or for any
purpose other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Master Participation Agreement without, in each instance, our prior written
consent.

                                Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have reviewed an executed copy of each of the following agreements:

(i)  the Power Supply Agreement (110 MW) (the "PSA"), dated December 31, 2004,
     between Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. (the "Borrower") and ElectroPeru
     S.A. ("ElectroPeru"); and

(ii) the Power Supply Agreement (46 MW), dated December 31, 2004, between the
     Borrower and ElectroPeru (together with the PSA, the "Agreements").

Unless otherwise expressly provided herein, all capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to such terms in
Schedule Z to the Master Security Agreement, dated __, among the Borrower, the
Senior Facility Lenders, the Lead JBIC Arrangers, the Global Coordinators, the
Lead Arrangers, the Administrative Agent, the Trustee, the Offshore Collateral
Agent and the Onshore Collateral Agent.

This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Section 5.01(g)(vii) of the Master
Participation Agreement.

In our examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the
authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals and the conformity
with authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In
addition, we have examined such corporate records, certificates and other
documents of the Borrower and ElectroPeru, and such questions of law, as we have
considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

<PAGE>

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and
qualifications set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

1.   As of December 31, 2004, the execution and delivery by ElectroPeru, and the
     incurrence and performance by ElectroPeru, of its obligations under each of
     the Agreements had been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
     on the part of ElectroPeru.

2.   As of December 31, 2004, each of the Agreements constituted, and as of the
     date hereof each of the Agreements constitutes, the legal, valid and
     binding obligation of ElectroPeru, enforceable against ElectroPeru in
     accordance with its terms.

3.   Each of the Agreements is in proper legal form for the enforcement thereof
     against ElectroPeru in the courts of Peru. No registration, notarization or
     other formality (including, without limitation, payment of any stamp or
     similar tax) is required to be accomplished in Peru (except as has already
     been accomplished and is in full force and effect) for the legality,
     validity, enforceability or admissibility in evidence of each of the
     Agreements in Peru. We have no evidence that the filing of each of the
     Agreements required to be made by ElectroPeru pursuant to Article 8 of the
     Electricity Concessions Act, Law Decree No. 25844, has been made but such
     filing does not affect the legality, validity, enforceability or
     admissibility in evidence of the Agreements in Peru.

The foregoing opinions are limited to matters involving the laws of Peru and we
do not express any opinion as to the law of any other jurisdiction. Unless
otherwise indicated, our opinions set forth herein are based upon the facts in
existence and laws in effect as of the date hereof and we expressly disclaim any

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have reviewed an executed copy of the Power Supply Agreement (the "PSA"),
dated December 29, 2004, between Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. (the
"Borrower") and Empresa de Generacion Electrica de Arequipa S.A. - EGASA

with authentic originals of all documents submitted to us as copies. In

Based upon and subject to the foregoing and subject also to the comments and

1.   As of December 29, 2004, the execution and delivery by EGASA, and the
     incurrence and performance by EGASA, of its obligations under the PSA had
     been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
     EGASA.

2.   As of December 29, 2004, the PSA constituted, and as of the date hereof the
     PSA constitutes, the legal, valid and binding obligation of EGASA,
     enforceable against EGASA in accordance with its terms.

3.   The PSA is in proper legal form for the enforcement thereof against EGASA
     in the courts of Peru. No registration, notarization or other formality
     (including, without limitation, payment of any stamp or similar tax) is
     required to be accomplished in Peru (except as has already been
     accomplished and is in full force and effect) for the legality, validity,
     enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the PSA in Peru. We have no
     evidence that the filing of the PSA required to be made by EGASA pursuant
     to Article 8 of the Electricity Concessions Act, Law Decree No. 25844, has
     been made but such filing does not affect the legality, validity,
     enforceability or admissibility in evidence of the PSA in Peru.

for the purposes of this opinion. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Completion
Guarantee.

          Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that each of the
Completion Guarantee, the Transfer Restriction Agreement and the Consent (the
"Agreements") constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of each of SMM,
SC, SGM and the Sumitomo Participant enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

          We express no opinion as to:

          (i) Section 19.3(a) of the Completion Guarantee, Section 4.08(a) of
     the Transfer Restriction Agreement and Section 5(e) of the Consent, to the
     extent that each such Section relates to the waiver of inconvenient forum
     with respect to proceedings in any United States Federal Court located in
     the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York;

          (ii) Section 19.3(a) of the Completion Guarantee, Section 4.08(a) of
     the Transfer Restriction Agreement and Section 5(e) of the Consent insofar
     as such provisions relate to subject matter jurisdiction of any United
     States Federal court;

          (iii) any provision of the Completion Guarantee purporting to provide
     indemnification to any person to the extent inconsistent with public policy
     or otherwise contrary to law;

          (iv) any provision of the Agreements insofar as such provision is
     invalid, not binding or unenforceable under the laws of the jurisdiction
     (other than the State of New York) under which a party to such agreement is
     organized; and

          (v) the validity or binding effect of any waiver under any of the
     Agreements or any consent thereunder, relating to the rights of any of SMM,
     SC, the Sumitomo Participant or SGM or duties owing to any of them existing
     as a matter of law except to the extent that they may so waive or consent
     under applicable law.

          We note that provisions of the Agreements that permit persons named
therein to take action or make determinations may be subject to a requirement
that such action be taken or such determinations be made on a reasonable basis
or in good faith.

          We also note that:

          (i) provisions of the Agreements that (A) prohibit or restrict parties
     thereto from transferring their respective rights in the collateral or any
     proceeds thereof or from creating, attaching, perfecting or enforcing a
     security interest in such collateral except as specified therein, (B)
     impose a consent requirement on

     such transfer or pledge, or (C) provide that such transfer or pledge may
     give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense,
     termination, right of termination or remedy may be unenforceable by virtue
     of Sections 9-401, 9-406 and/or 9-408 of the UCC as in effect on the date
     hereof in the State of New York;

          (ii) certain remedial and other provisions of the Agreements (A) may
     be subject to the right of account debtors, the terms of the contracts with
     such account debtors and any claims or defenses of such account debtors
     arising under or outside such contracts and (B) may be unenforceable in
     whole or in part under applicable law, provided that the inclusion of such
     provisions does not, in our opinion (but subject to the other comments and
     qualifications set forth in this opinion letter), make the remedies and
     procedures that will be afforded to the Senior Lenders inadequate for the
     practical realization of the benefits purported to be provided to the
     Senior Lenders by the Agreements; and

          (iii) the enforceability of Section 9.14 of the Completion Guarantee,
     Section 4.09 of the Transfer Restriction Agreement and Section 5(c) of the
     Consent to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in
     writing may be limited under certain circumstances.

independent verification that:

     (i) each party to each Agreement has been duly organized and is an existing
     legal entity in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
     organization;

     (ii) each Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the
     respective parties thereto;

     obligation arising out of a transaction covering in the aggregate not less
     than US$1,000,000.

          The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United
States and the laws of the State of New York, and we are expressing no opinion
as to the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

          With your approval, we have relied as to certain matters upon
information obtained from public officials, officers of SMM, SC, SGM and the
Sumitomo Participant and other sources believed by us to be responsible.

          This opinion is being delivered to you pursuant to Section 5.01(g)(ix)
of the Master Participation Agreement solely for your benefit and is not to be
made available to, nor may it be relied upon, by any other person, firm or
entity.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     In connection with the Concentrate Sales Agreement, dated as of June 1,
2005, as amended by Amendment No. 1, dated as of September [30], 2005 (as so
amended, the "Concentrate Sales Agreement"), between Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.,
Ltd., a Japanese corporation ("SMM"), and Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A., a
sociedad anonima abierta organized under the laws of the Republic of Peru
("Cerro Verde"), we, as special New York counsel to SMM, have examined such
corporate records, certificates and other documents and such questions of law as
we have considered necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion.

as Administrative Agent for the Senior Lenders,                              -2-


     Upon the basis of such examination, it is our opinion that the Concentrate
Sales Agreement constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of SMM
enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity
principles.

     We express no opinion as to:

          (i) Section 17.1 of the Concentrate Sales Agreement, to the extent
that such Section relates to a waiver of inconvenient forum with respect to
proceedings in any United States Federal Court located in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York;

          (ii) Section 17.1 or 23.1(d) of the Concentrate Sales Agreement
insofar as such provisions relate to subject matter jurisdiction of any United
States Federal court;

          (iii) the enforceability of any provisions of the Concentrate Sales
Agreement providing for payment to be made without any set-off, defense or
counterclaim;

          (iv) the validity or binding effect of any waiver under the
Concentrate Sales Agreement or any consent thereunder, relating to the rights
SMM or duties owing

to it existing as a matter of law except to the extent they may so waive or
consent under applicable law;

          (v) any provision of the Concentrate Sales Agreement insofar as such
provision is invalid, not binding or unenforceable under the laws of the
jurisdiction (other than the State of New York) under which a party to such
agreement is organized; and

          (vi) the enforceability of SMM's obligations for any default interest
charges or late charges.

     We note that provisions of the Concentrate Sales Agreement that permit
persons named therein to take action or make determinations may be subject to a
requirement that such action be taken or such determinations be made on a
reasonable basis or in good faith

     We also note that:

     (i) the enforceability of Section 24.1 of the Concentrate Sales Agreement
to the effect that terms may not be waived or modified except in writing may be
limited under certain circumstances; and

     (ii) certain remedial and other provisions of the Concentrate Sales
Agreement (A) may be subject to the right of account debtors, the terms of the
contracts with such account debtors and any claims or defenses of such account
debtors arising under or outside such contracts and (B) may be unenforceable in
whole or in part under applicable law, provided that the inclusion of such
provisions does not, in our opinion (but subject to the other comments and
qualifications set forth in this opinion letter), make the remedies and
procedures that will be afforded to the Senior Project Lenders (as defined in
the Concentrate Sales Agreement) inadequate for the practical realization of the
benefits purported to be provided to the Senior Project Lenders by the
Concentrate Sales Agreement.

     The foregoing opinion is limited to the Federal laws of the United States
and the laws of the State of New York, and we are expressing no opinion as to
the effect of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

     We have relied as to certain matters upon information obtained from public
officials, officers of SMM and other sources believed by us to be responsible,
and we have assumed, without independent verification that:

          (i) each party to the Concentrate Sales Agreement has been duly
organized and is an existing legal entity in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization;

not less than US$1,000,000.

Re:  Concentrate Sales Agreement between Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd.
     ("Buyer") and Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. ("Seller") dated as of
     June 1, 2005 (as amended by the Letter of Amendment to the SMM Concentrate
     Sales Agreement ("Amendment No. 1"), dated as of September 30, 2005; the
     "Agreement");
     Opinion of Buyer's Counsel under Section 24.6 of the Agreement.

Dear Sirs:

We have acted as counsel in Japan for Buyer in connection with the captioned
matter, and have been asked to provide the legal opinion ("Opinion") required
under Section 24.6 of the Agreement in respect of Buyer. Capitalized terms used
and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the MPA.

In connection with this Opinion, we have reviewed and/or relied on copies or
certified copies of the following:

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

a)   the Master Participation Agreement dated as of September 30, 2005, among
     Seller, Japan Bank for International Cooperation ("JBIC"), Sumitomo Mitsui
     Banking Corporation ("SMBC"), The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. ("BOT-M"),
     KfW, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ("RBS"), The Bank of Nova Scotia
     ("Scotia Capital"), Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. ("Mizuho") and CALYON New
     York Branch, in its individual capacity and as Administrative Agent for the
     Senior Facility Lenders ("Calyon");

b)   the Master Security Agreement dated as of September 30, 2005, among Seller,
     JBIC, SMBC, BOT-M, KfW, RBS, Scotia Capital, Mizuho, Calyon, Citibank del
     Peru S.A., as Onshore Collateral Agent and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee and
     Offshore Collateral Agent; and

c)   the Agreement and the signature pages for the Agreement, together with the
     stamped and signed notarial certificate of the signature of the
     representative director of Buyer,

d)   the articles of incorporation of Buyer,

e)   the internal regulations of the board of directors of Buyer,

f)   the company registration of Buyer dated September 22, 2005,

g)   an excerpt from the minutes of a meeting of the board of directors of Buyer
     [dated March 8, 2005], passing a resolution approving the execution of the
     Agreement and delegating final approval of contents to the executive
     officer in charge of the Mineral Resources Division.

h)   such other corporate records, agreements and instruments, certificates and
     other material as we have deemed necessary or desirable, and

i)   such statements and confirmations from officers of Buyer, and such other
     matters of fact and law, as we have deemed appropriate for the purposes of
     this Opinion.

In giving this Opinion, we have assumed (but not independently verified):

1)   That the Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by each
     of the parties thereto (except in the case of Buyer) in the same form as
     reviewed by us;

2)   That the Agreement is legal and valid under the law of the State of New
     York, by which it is stated to be governed, and that the transactions
     contemplated by the Agreement that are to be performed in the Republic of
     Peru, where Seller is located, are legal under the laws of the Republic of
     Peru; and

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

3)   That all copies reviewed by us are in conformity with the originals
     thereof, and that any signatures thereon are genuine and affixed (except in
     the case of Buyer) by persons with authority to do so.

We are qualified to practice law in Japan, and we do not express any opinion
with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction, and this opinion is limited
to matters of Japanese law under the laws of Japan in force as of the date
hereof. Particularly, we expressly offer no opinion as to the laws of the State
of New York, which is the governing law under the Agreement.

Based on the above, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set out
below, we are of the opinion that:

1)   Buyer is a corporation duly organized, and is validly existing under the
     laws of Japan where Buyer was incorporated;

2)   Buyer has full power and authority to own its properties and conduct the
     business in which it is engaged, and to execute, deliver and perform, and
     incur the obligations provided in the Agreement;

3)   The Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by Buyer and
     constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable
     in accordance with its terms; and

4)   All authorizations, licenses, approvals (including without limitation,
     foreign exchange approvals) and consents from, and filings and
     registrations with, governmental authorities in Japan which are necessary
     for the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement by Buyer have
     been obtained and are in full force and effect.

5)   The making and performance by Buyer of the Agreement do not and will not
     (i)violate any provision of law, statute, rule, order, injunction, decree,
     writ, judgment or regulation or any provision of its organizational
     documents as currently in effect or (ii)result in the breach of, or
     constitute a default or require any consent under, or result in the
     creation of any lien or encumbrance upon, any of its properties, revenues
     or assets pursuant to, any indenture, mortgage, contract or other agreement
     or instrument to which Buyer is now a party or by which it or its
     properties may now be bound or affected.

6)   Assuming that the Agreement is legal, valid, binding and enforceable under
     the laws of the State of New York:

     (a)  The choice of the laws of the State of New York to govern the
          Agreement is a valid choice of law under the laws of Japan, and a
          court in Japan would uphold such choice of law, in regard to
          substantive law issues, in a suit on the Agreement brought in a court
          in Japan.

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

     (b)  Under the Agreement, Buyer has validly submitted to the jurisdiction
          of the State and Federal courts located in the Borough of Manhattan,
          the City of New York for the purposes specified in Section 17.1 of the
          Agreement.

7)   If any final judgment of a foreign court is rendered with respect to the
     Agreement, the judgment would be recognized and enforced by the courts of
     Japan without re-examination or re-litigation on the merits thereof,
     subject to the conditions stipulated in Article 118 of the Code of Civil
     Procedure of Japan that:

     (a)  the foreign court's jurisdiction is allowed by laws and ordinances or
          by treaty;

     (b)  the defeated party has received service (except for service by
          publication of notice or any similar means) of summons or any other
          necessary orders to commence procedures or has responded in the action
          without receiving service thereof;

     (c)  the contents of the judgment and the procedures of the litigation are
          not contrary to the public order or morals of Japan; and

     (d)  there is reciprocity.

8)   An arbitral award will be enforceable in Japan, pursuant to a request for
     and receipt of an enforcement decision made in the competent court in
     Japan, unless any one of the following under Article 45 of the Arbitration
     Law of Japan is applicable (with respect to the grounds described in items
     (a) through (g), this shall be limited to where either of the parties has
     proven the existence of the ground in question):

     (a)  the arbitration agreement is not valid due to limits to a party's
          capacity;

     (b)  the arbitration agreement is not valid for a reason other than limits
          to a party's capacity under the law to which the parties have agreed
          to subject it (or failing any indication thereon, the law of the
          country under which the place of arbitration falls);

     (c)  a party was not given notice as required by the provisions of the law
          of the country under which the place of arbitration falls (or where
          the parties have otherwise reached an agreement on matters concerning
          the provisions of the law that do not relate to public policy, such
          agreement) in the proceedings to appoint arbitrators or in the
          arbitral proceedings;

     (d)  a party was unable to defend itself in the arbitral proceedings;

     (e)  the arbitral award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of
          the arbitration agreement or the claims in the arbitral proceedings;

     (f)  the composition of an arbitral tribunal or the arbitral proceedings
          were not in accordance with the provisions of the law of the country
          under which the place of arbitration falls (or where the parties have
          otherwise reached an

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

          agreement on matters concerning the provisions of the law that do not
          relate to public policy, such agreement);

     (g)  according to the law of the country under which the place of
          arbitration falls (or where the law of a country other than the
          country under which the place of arbitration falls was applied to the
          arbitral proceedings, such country), the arbitral award has not yet
          become binding, or the arbitral award has been set aside or suspended
          by a court of such country;

     (h)  the claims in the arbitral proceedings relate to a dispute that cannot
          constitute the subject of an arbitration agreement under the laws of
          Japan; or

     (i)  the content of the arbitral award would be contrary to the public
          policy or good morals of Japan.

9)   Assuming that CT Corporation System has, under the laws of the State of New
     York, been duly appointed by Buyer as its agent to receive service of
     process in the State of New York, service of process made on CT Corporation
     System pursuant to such appointment will, under the laws of Japan, be
     considered served personally on Buyer and satisfy the condition of Article
     118 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Japan in regard to a judgment
     rendered by a New York court.

10)  Assignment by Seller of its rights to receipt of payments under Article 15
     of the Agreement is valid and enforceable against Buyer under the laws of
     Japan; provided that in order to fully perfect the effectiveness of such
     assignment against third persons, either the notice by Seller to Buyer of
     such assignment must be made by a date-certified writing (proved by
     notarization or contents-certified mail), or recordation with the competent
     registry must be made.

The opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications and
limitations:

(i)  Nothing in this Opinion should be taken as indicating that the remedies of
     specific performance or injunction (being in some instances discretionary
     remedies of the court) would necessarily be available with respect to any
     particular provision of the Agreement in any particular instance.

(ii) Enforcement of the Agreement against Buyer will be subject to (i)
     applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar laws
     affecting the enforcement of creditor rights generally, (ii) laws imposing
     duties to act in good faith or in a commercially reasonable manner, and
     (iii) laws respecting or affecting the procedural or remedial provisions of
     the Agreement.

This Opinion is provided solely in connection with the Agreement, in respect of
the matters specifically set out above, and is not to be used in relation to any
other matter or fact situation.

In giving this Opinion, we have assumed (but not independently verified):

1)   That the Opinion Agreements have been duly authorized, executed and
     delivered by all parties thereto (except in the case of SMM and SC) in the
     same form as reviewed by us;

2)   That the Opinion Agreements are legal and valid under the law of the State
     of New York, by which they are stated to be governed, and that all of the
     actions under the Opinion Agreements that are to be performed in the
     Republic of Peru, where Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. is located, are
     legal under the laws of the Republic of Peru; and

3)   That all copies reviewed by us are in conformity with the originals
     thereof.

We are qualified to practice law in Japan, and we do not express any opinion
with respect to the laws of any other jurisdiction, and this opinion is limited
to matters of Japanese law under the laws of Japan in force as of the date
hereof. Particularly, we expressly offer no opinion as to the laws of the State
of New York, which is the governing law under the Opinion Agreements.

Based on the above, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set out
below, we are of the opinion that:

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

1.   Each Parent Company is a corporation duly organized, and validly existing
     under the laws of Japan and has all requisite power and authority to own
     its property and conduct its business.

2.   Each Parent Company has full power and authority to enter into each of the
     Opinion Agreements to which it is party and to incur and perform the
     obligations provided for therein.

3.   Each Opinion Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
     each Parent Company thereto and constitute the valid and legally binding
     obligation of each Parent Company thereto, enforceable in accordance with
     its terms.

4.   All authorizations, approvals and consents from and filings and
     registrations with, governmental authorities in Japan which are necessary
     for the execution, delivery and performance of each Opinion Agreement by
     each Parent Company have been obtained and are in full force and effect.

5.   There is no provision of law, statute, regulation, rule, order, injunction,
     decree, writ or judgment, or the charter or constitutive documents of each
     Parent Company, and no provision of any mortgage, indenture, contract or
     agreement binding on each Parent Company or affecting any of its respective
     properties, which would prohibit, conflict with or in any way prevent the
     execution, delivery, or performance by each Parent Company of any of the
     Opinion Agreements to which it is a party. Except as provided in the
     Opinion Agreements, the execution, delivery and performance of the Opinion
     Agreements will not result in the creation or imposition of any lien,
     security interest, charge or encumbrance of any nature upon the property of
     each Parent Company. The making and performance by the Parent Companies of
     the Opinion Agreements do not and will not (i) violate any provision of law
     or regulation or any provision of its organizational documents as currently
     in effect or (ii) result in the breach of, or constitute a default or
     require any consent under any indenture or other agreement or instrument to
     which any of the Parent Companies are now a party or by which it or its
     properties may now be bound or affected.

     (a)  Assuming that the Opinion Agreements are executed outside Japan, no
          documentary, stamp or similar tax, imposition or charge need to be
          paid on any Opinion Agreement in Japan.

     (b)  No documentary, stamp or similar tax, imposition or charge need be
          paid in order to ensure the legality, validity, enforceability or
          admissibility in evidence of a Opinion Agreement in Japan.

     (c)  It is not necessary for the validity or enforceability of the
          obligations of the Parent Companies under the Opinion Agreements to
          file or register or record the Opinion Agreements in any public office
          in Japan.

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

6.   The Opinion Agreements are in proper legal form under the laws of Japan for
     enforcement thereof against the Parent Companies and it is not necessary,
     for the legality, validity, enforceability of or admissibility into
     evidence of the Opinion Agreements that it be filed or recorded with any
     court or other authority in Japan or that any Opinion Agreement be written,
     executed and delivered in Japanese pursuant to the laws of Japan; provided
     that items offered into evidence in a legal proceeding in Japan may require
     a Japanese translation be attached thereto.

7.   The choice of the laws of the State of New York to govern the Opinion
     Agreements is a valid choice of law under the laws of Japan, and a court in
     Japan would uphold such choice of law, in regard to substantive law issues,
     in a suit on such Opinion Agreement in Japan.

8.   Under each Opinion Agreement each Parent Company thereto has validly
     submitted to the jurisdiction of the State of New York for the purposes
     specified therein. A final and conclusive judgment rendered by a State or
     Federal court in the State of New York having jurisdiction and venue over
     each Parent Company, and which is not subject to appeal and is enforceable
     in the United States of America, may be enforced against each Parent
     Company in Japan without a review of the merits, provided that the
     following requirements under Article 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure of
     Japan are met:

     (a)  The foreign court's jurisdiction is allowed by laws and ordinances or
          by treaty;

     (b)  the defeated party has received service (except for service by
          publication of notice or any similar means) of summons or any other
          necessary orders to commence procedures or has responded in the action
          without receiving service thereof;

     (c)  the contents of the judgment and the procedures of the litigation are
          not contrary to the public order or morals of Japan; and

     (d)  there is reciprocity.

9.   An arbitral award will be enforceable in Japan, pursuant to a request for
     and receipt of an enforcement decision made in the competent court in
     Japan, unless any one of the following under Article 45 of the Arbitration
     Law of Japan is applicable (with respect to the grounds described in items
     (a) through (g), this shall be limited to where either of the parties has
     proven the existence of the ground in question):

     (a)  the arbitration agreement is not valid due to limits to a party's
          capacity;

     (b)  the arbitration agreement is not valid for a reason other than limits
          to a party's capacity under the law to which the parties have agreed
          to subject it (or failing any indication thereon, the law of the
          country under which the place of arbitration falls);

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

     (c)  a party was not given notice as required by the provisions of the law
          of the country under which the place of arbitration falls (or where
          the parties have otherwise reached an agreement on matters concerning
          the provisions of the law that do not relate to public policy, such
          agreement) in the proceedings to appoint arbitrators or in the
          arbitral proceedings;

     (d)  a party was unable to defend itself in the arbitral proceedings;

     (e)  the arbitral award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of
          the arbitration agreement or the claims in the arbitral proceedings;

     (f)  the composition of an arbitral tribunal or the arbitral proceedings
          were not in accordance with the provisions of the law of the country
          under which the place of arbitration falls (or where the parties have
          otherwise reached an agreement on matters concerning the provisions of
          the law that do not relate to public policy, such agreement);

     (g)  according to the law of the country under which the place of
          arbitration falls (or where the law of a country other than the
          country under which the place of arbitration falls was applied to the
          arbitral proceedings, such country), the arbitral award has not yet
          become binding, or the arbitral award has been set aside or suspended
          by a court of such country;

     (h)  the claims in the arbitral proceedings relate to a dispute that cannot
          constitute the subject of an arbitration agreement under the laws of
          Japan; or

     (i)  the content of the arbitral award would be contrary to the public
          policy or good morals of Japan.

10.  Assuming that CT Corporation System has, under the laws of the State of New
     York been duly appointed by the Parent Companies as their agent to receive
     service of process in the State of New York, service of process made on CT
     Corporation System pursuant to such appointment will, under the laws of
     Japan, be considered served personally on the Parent Companies and satisfy
     the condition of Article 118 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Japan in
     regard to a judgment rendered by a New York court.

11.  There is no action, suit or proceeding pending against or affecting either
     Parent Company or any of their properties in any court or before any
     governmental authority in Japan and no existing default by either Parent
     Company under any applicable order, or injunction or decree of any court or
     governmental authority in Japan, in each case that could be expected to
     have a material adverse effect on or that questions the legality, validity
     or enforceability of any of the Opinion Agreements.

12.  Neither of the Parent Companies nor any of their assets have any immunity
     (or rights to claim that they have immunity) from jurisdiction of any court
     or from any legal process (whether through service, notice, attachment
     prior to

<PAGE>

                                                                  SAKAI & MIMURA

     judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise).

The opinions expressed above are subject to the following qualifications and
limitations:

(i)  Nothing in this Opinion should be taken as indicating that the remedies of
     specific performance or injunction (being in some instances discretionary
     remedies of the court) would necessarily be available with respect to any
     particular provision of the Opinion Agreements in any particular instance.

(ii) Enforcement of the Opinion Agreements against Parent Companies will be
     subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or other
     similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditor rights generally, (ii)
     laws imposing duties to act in good faith or in a commercially reasonable
     manner, and (iii) laws respecting or affecting the procedural or remedial
     provisions of the Agreement.

This Opinion is provided solely in connection with the Opinion Agreements, in
respect of the matters specifically set out above, and is not to be used in
relation to any other matter or fact situation.

Sincerely yours,
SAKAI & MIMURA

Dear Sirs, Madam,

1.   We have acted as legal advisers in the Netherlands to SMM Cerro Verde
     Netherlands B.V. (the SUMITOMO PARTICIPANT) and to Summit Global Management

          submitted any resolutions of the management board to its approval
          pursuant to Article 11(4) of the SGM Articles; we note that if any

          obligations of the Dutch Companies that are a party thereto in
          accordance with their terms under the law by which they are expressed
          to be governed;

     (j)  that, insofar as any obligation of any Dutch Company under the
          Agreements falls to be performed in, or is otherwise affected by the
          laws of, any jurisdiction other than the laws of the Netherlands, its
          performance would not be illegal or ineffective under the laws of that
          jurisdiction;

     (k)  that any law, other than Dutch law, which may apply to the Share
          Pledge Power of Attorney or to the Agreements (or the transactions
          contemplated thereby) would not be such as to affect any conclusion
          stated in this opinion;

     (l)  that each security right created by the Share Pledge has been validly
          created and can be enforced against each asset described therein as
          security for the payment and performance of the obligations and
          liabilities expressed to be secured thereby under the laws by which it
          is expressed to be governed;

     (m)  that at the time a security right becomes effective pursuant to the
          Share Pledge, title to each asset which is made subject to that
          security right is held by the Sumitomo Participant;

     (n)  that each Dutch Company has its centre of main interests within the
          meaning of the Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on
          Insolvency Procedures (the REGULATION) in the Netherlands and that it
          has not been subjected to any one or more of the insolvency and
          winding-up proceedings listed in Annex A or Annex B to the Regulation
          in any EU Member State, other than the Netherlands, on the date of
          execution of the Agreements;


                                        3

<PAGE>

4.   This opinion is limited to the laws of the Netherlands currently in force
     (unpublished case law not included) excluding tax law (except as
     specifically referred to herein), the laws of the EU (insofar as not
     implemented in Dutch law or directly applicable in the Netherlands) and
     competition or procurement laws.

     We express no opinion as to matters of fact. We assume that there are no
     facts not disclosed to us which would affect the conclusions in this
     opinion.

     This opinion is limited to the Agreements and the matters contemplated
     therein and does not relate to any other agreement or matter. Nothing in
     this opinion should be taken as expressing an opinion in respect of any
     representation, warranty or other statement contained in the Agreements.

5.   Based on the foregoing and subject to the qualifications set out below, we
     are of the opinion that:

     (a)  STATUS

          Each Dutch Company is duly incorporated and validly existing as a
          private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met
          beperkte aansprakelijkheid) under Dutch law.

     (b)  POWERS AND AUTHORITY

          Each Dutch Company has the corporate power and authority to enter
          into, incur and perform the obligations expressed to be assumed by it
          under each Agreement to which it is a party and has taken all
          necessary corporate action to authorise the execution and delivery of
          such Agreement. The Sumitomo Participant has all requisite power and
          authority to own its assets and conduct its business as set out in the
          objects and purposes clause of the Sumitomo Participant Articles. The
          Sumitomo Participant has the corporate power and authority to issue
          the Share Pledge Power of Attorney and has taken all necessary
          corporate action to authorise the execution and delivery of such Share
          Pledge Power of Attorney.

     (c)  DUE EXECUTION

          Each Agreement has been duly authorised, executed and delivered by the
          Dutch Company that is a party thereto. The Share Pledge Power of
          Attorney has been duly authorised, executed and delivered by the
          Sumitomo Participant.

     (d)  APPLICATION OF PROPER LAW

          The choice of law as contained in the Agreements would be upheld as a
          valid choice of law by Dutch courts and applied by those courts in
          proceedings in relation to the Agreements as the governing law
          thereof, except (i) to the extent that any term of an Agreement or any
          provision of the law applicable to that Agreement is manifestly
          incompatible with Dutch public policy and (ii) that


                                        4

<PAGE>

          mandatory provisions of Dutch law may be given effect if and insofar
          as, under Dutch law those provisions must be applied irrespective of
          the chosen law.

     (e)  LEGAL VALIDITY

          Subject to the opinion given under (d) above, each of the Agreements
          constitutes a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of each
          Dutch Company in accordance with its terms and each Agreement is in
          proper form for its enforcement in Dutch courts.

     (f)  NON-CONFLICT WITH LAWS

          The execution by each Dutch Company of each Agreement to which it is a
          party does not and its performance of such Agreement will not (i)
          conflict with or result in a violation of any provision of the
          relevant Articles or the provisions of any published law, rule or
          regulation of general application of the Netherlands, and (ii) result
          in, or require the creation or imposition of, any lien, charge or
          encumbrance (other than under the Agreements) on any of its properties
          or revenues by operation of any law, rule or regulation referred to
          (i) above.

     (g)  CONSENTS

          No authorisations, approvals, consents, licences, exemptions, filings,
          registrations, notarisations or other requirements of governmental,
          judicial or public bodies or authorities of or in the Netherlands are
          required in connection with each Dutch Company's entry into or
          performance of the Agreements to which it is a party or for its
          validity or enforceability against the relevant Dutch Company, except
          for notice requirements to the Dutch Central Bank pursuant to the Act
          on Foreign Financial Relations (Wet financiele betrekkingen
          buitenland) 1994 and regulations promulgated thereunder. Failure to
          observe these requirements does not affect the validity or
          enforceability of the Agreements.

     (h)  PARI PASSU RANKING

          The obligations of each Dutch Company under the Agreements to which it
          is a party will rank at least pari passu with all its other unsecured
          obligations other than those preferred by statute, and with the
          exception of any rights of set-off or counterclaim which may be
          asserted by or against each Dutch Company.

     (i)  STAMP DUTIES

          No stamp or registration fee or duty or similar taxes or charges are
          payable in the Netherlands in connection with the execution or
          enforcement of the Agreements.

     (j)  NO IMMUNITY


                                        5

<PAGE>

          Each Dutch Company is subject to civil and commercial law with respect
          to its obligations under the Agreements to which it is a party, the
          entry into and performance of the Agreements to which it is a party by
          the relevant Dutch Company constitute private and commercial acts and
          neither of the Dutch Companies nor any of its assets located in the
          Netherlands enjoys any right of immunity from set-off, suit,
          attachment prior to judgment, execution or other legal process in
          respect of its obligations under the Agreements to which it is a
          party.

     (k)  SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION

          The submission to jurisdiction by the Dutch Companies contained in the
          Agreements is valid and binding on the Dutch Companies and not subject
          to revocation. This submission does not preclude that claims for
          provisional measures in summary proceedings may be brought before a
          competent Dutch court.

     (l)  ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN JUDGMENTS

          There is no treaty between the United States of America and the
          Netherlands regarding the recognition and enforcement of judicial
          decisions. There is also no such treaty between Peru and the
          Netherlands. In the absence of such treaties,, a judgement rendered by
          a court in New York County in the City of New York or by a court in
          Lima-Cercado will not be enforced by Dutch courts. In order to obtain
          a judgement which is enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be
          relitigated before a competent Dutch court. If and to the extent that
          the Dutch court finds that the jurisdiction of the relevant foreign
          courts has been based on grounds which are internationally acceptable
          and that proper legal procedures have been observed, the Dutch court
          would, in principle, give binding effect to the final judgement of the
          relevant foreign courts unless such judgement contravenes principles
          of Dutch public policy.

     (m)  NO RESIDENCY

          It is not a condition to the ability of any Secured Party to bring a
          legal action in a Dutch court against the Dutch Companies in respect
          of any Agreement that such Secured Party has complied with any
          requirements in the Netherlands necessary to enable it to do or carry
          on business in the Netherlands. The Secured Parties are not and will
          not be deemed resident, carrying on business, subject to taxation as
          such or subject to environmental liability in the Netherlands solely
          by reason of the execution, delivery, performance or enforcement of
          any of the Agreements to which they are a party.

     (n)  APPOINTMENT OF AGENT


                                        6

<PAGE>

          Assuming that CT Corporation System has, under the laws of the State
          of New York, been duly appointed by the Dutch Companies as their agent
          to receive service of process in the State of New York, service of
          process made on CT Corporation System pursuant to such appointment
          will, under the laws of the Netherlands, be considered served
          personally on the Dutch Companies for the purpose of proceedings in
          the State of New York if such service of process has been validly made
          under the law of the State of New York.

     (o)  PROPER FORM

          Each of the Agreements is in proper legal form under the laws of the
          Netherlands for the enforcement thereof in accordance with its terms
          against the Dutch Companies and, to ensure the legality,
          enforceability and admissibility in evidence of each of the Agreements
          in the Netherlands, it is not necessary that any of the Agreements or
          any other documents be filed or recorded with any court or other
          authority in the Netherlands or that any stamp or similar tax be paid
          on or in respect of any of the Agreements or that any of the
          Agreements be written, executed and delivered in Dutch pursuant to the
          laws of the Netherlands.

6.   This opinion is subject to the following qualifications:

     (a)  This opinion is limited by all bankruptcy (faillissement), moratorium
          (surseance van betaling), fraudulent conveyance (Actio Pauliana) or
          similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, provided that the
          security rights created by the Share Pledge Agreement will not be
          affected by a bankruptcy or moratorium of the Sumitomo Participant
          except as set forth in qualifications (b), (c) and (d) below.

     (b)  Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Code, a receiver in bankruptcy can require
          the holder of a security right in an asset which forms part of the
          bankrupt estate to foreclose such security right within a reasonable
          period of time. If that holder fails to do so, the receiver may sell
          the assets himself, in the manner provided for in the Dutch Bankruptcy
          Code. In the latter case, the holder of the security right concerned
          may only realise its claim by submission thereof in the bankruptcy and
          will receive payment, if any, only through distribution of the
          proceeds of that sale less the holder's share in the bankruptcy costs
          and subject to the satisfaction of higher ranking claims of creditors.
          Furthermore, under the Dutch Bankruptcy Code, foreclosure by the
          holder of a security right in an asset which forms part of or which is
          in the control of the bankrupt estate or which is owned or controlled
          by a company which has been granted a moratorium, as the case may be,
          may be prevented by the bankruptcy judge (in case of bankruptcy) or by
          the court (in case of a moratorium), in each case for a maximum period
          of four months.

     (c)  The validity of the Share Pledge Agreement may be affected by the
          provisions of section 42 of the Dutch Bankruptcy Code. These
          provisions grant to the receiver in bankruptcy of a company the right
          to challenge the validity of a security right granted by that company
          if (i) that security right is granted by the company


                                        7

<PAGE>

          without a legal obligation to do so, (ii) the rights of the creditors
          (including future creditors) are thereby prejudiced and (iii) there is
          knowledge on the part of the company and the party to which or for
          whose benefit the security right is granted that the rights of the
          creditors would be prejudiced thereby).

     (d)  Under Dutch bankruptcy law, assets that are acquired or come into
          existence after bankruptcy or moratorium of the Sumitomo Participant,
          may not be subject to the security rights created by the Share Pledge
          Agreement and will therefore form part of the bankrupt estate. A right
          that is exercisable or a receivable that becomes due and payable after
          bankruptcy or moratorium will only be deemed to exist prior to the
          bankruptcy or moratorium if it is not subject to an act of the
          creditor or debtor thereof.

     (e)  As used in this opinion, the term ENFORCEABLE means that the
          obligations referred to are of a type enforced by Dutch courts. It is
          not certain, however, that each such obligation will be enforced in
          accordance with its terms in every circumstance, the enforcement being
          subject, inter alia, to the nature of the available remedies. We do
          not express any opinion as to whether specific performance or
          injunctive relief would be available in respect of any obligations of
          each Dutch Company under the Agreements to which it is a party.

     (f)  The enforcement in the Netherlands of the Agreements and foreign
          judgments will be subject to the rules of civil procedure as applied
          by Dutch courts.

     (g)  A Dutch court may decline jurisdiction if concurrent proceedings are
          being brought elsewhere.

     (h)  Under Dutch law, each power of attorney (volmacht) or mandate
          (lastgeving), whether or not irrevocable, granted by each Dutch
          Company in the Agreements, will terminate by force of law and without
          notice, upon bankruptcy of each Dutch Company and cease to have effect
          upon each Dutch Company having been granted a moratorium. The
          foregoing applies to any appointment of a service of process agent by
          the Dutch Companies.

     (i)  Generally with respect to the enforcement by Dutch courts of security
          rights created under a law other than Dutch law (hereafter to be
          referred too as FOREIGN SECURITY RIGHTS), there is no conclusive case
          law in the Netherlands. The foreclosure and ranking of security rights
          and preferred rights in the Netherlands will be subject to Dutch law
          which has a fixed system and mandatory ranking of those rights.

          Provided that a foreign security right has been validly created and is
          enforceable under the law by which it is expressed to be governed and
          complies with the Dutch conflict of laws rules as set out below and
          subject to (i) the exceptions to the validity of a choice of law as
          set forth in our opinion contained in paragraph 5, sub-paragraph (d),
          and (ii) the other qualifications contained in this opinion,


                                        8

<PAGE>

          that foreign security right will be recognised in the Netherlands. If
          recognised, the foreign security right will be enforced, and have the
          same ranking, as the Dutch security right which, in content and
          purpose, most closely resembles it. This means that the secured party
          may not have more rights than it would have had if Dutch law had
          governed the security right concerned. We therefore do not opine on
          the enforceability in the Netherlands of the remedies afforded to the
          secured party and the powers and discretions awarded to a receiver, if
          any, in respect of a foreign security right under the law governing
          that right.

          Under Dutch conflict of laws rules a security right in a registered
          share in a company must constitute a legal, valid, binding and
          enforceable security right under the laws of the jurisdiction under
          which that company is incorporated.

7.   In this opinion, Dutch legal concepts are expressed in English terms and
     not in their original Dutch terms. The concepts concerned may not always be
     identical to the concepts described by the English terms as such terms may
     be understood under the laws of other jurisdictions. This opinion is given
     on the express basis, accepted by each person who is entitled to rely on
     it, that this opinion and all rights, obligations or liability in relation
     to it are governed by Dutch law and that any action or claim in relation to
     it can only be brought exclusively before the courts of Amsterdam, the
     Netherlands.

8.   This opinion is given exclusively in connection with the Agreements and for
     no other purpose. This opinion is given for the sole benefit of its
     addressees and may not be relied upon by any other person without our prior
     written consent.

Yours faithfully,

among SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V. ("Sumitomo"), Buenaventura, Cyprus Climax
Metals Company ("Cyprus") and Citibank del Peru S.A. ("Citibank-Peru"); (iii)
the Transfer Restrictions Agreement dated as of September 30, 2005 (the
"Transfer Restrictions Agreement") among Sumitomo, Buenaventura, Cyprus, SMM,
SC, PDC, JBIC, Sumitomo Mitsui, BOT-M, KfW, CALYON, RBS, Scotia Capital and

Shareholders Agreement, the Consent and the Transfer Restrictions Agreement are
hereinafter called, jointly, the "Financing Agreements". Capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to
such terms in the Completion Guarantee.

     In connection with the opinions hereinafter expressed, we have examined
originals or copies, whether certified or not, of such all public and corporate
records, resolutions, certificates and other documents and approvals of
Buenaventura as we have considered necessary or appropriate in rendering this
opinion.

     In our examination, we have assumed the legal capacity of all individuals
executing the Financing Agreements, the genuineness of all signatures and the
conformity with authentic original documents of all documents submitted to us as
copies. When relevant facts were not independently established, we have relied
upon representations made in or pursuant to the Financing Agreements.

     In giving the opinions below, we have further assumed (without
investigation on our part):

     (i)  the due organization and valid existence under the laws of its
          jurisdiction of incorporation of each of the parties to the Financing
          Agreements, except Buenaventura;

     (ii) each of the parties to the Financing Agreements, other than
          Buenaventura, has full power and authority to execute and deliver the
          Financing Agreements; and

     (iii) the execution and delivery of the Financing Agreements and the
          performance by the parties thereto, other than Buenaventura, of their
          obligations thereunder have been duly authorized by all requisite
          action and the Financing Agreements are valid, binding and enforceable
          under

          the laws of each jurisdiction in which any obligations thereunder are
          to be performed or in which any party thereto has been formed or
          organized.

     Based upon the foregoing, having regard to legal considerations we deem
relevant and subject to the qualifications, limitations and assumptions set
forth herein, we are of the opinion that insofar as the laws of Peru are
concerned:

     (1)  Buenaventura is a sociedad anonima abierta duly organized, validly
          existing and in good standing under the laws of Peru which has all
          requisite power and authority to own its property and to conduct its
          businesses as it is currently being conducted.

     (2)  Buenaventura has full power and authority to (i) enter into each of
          the Financing Agreements, (ii) incur and perform the obligations
          therein contained and (iii) grant to the Secured Parties the security
          interests in its property purported to be covered by the Share Pledge
          Agreement.

     (3)  There is no provision of any treaty, law, statute, regulation, rule,
          order or decree in or of Peru or any political subdivision thereof,
          nor award, decree or judgment of any court or governmental authority
          of competent jurisdiction to which Buenaventura is subject, and no
          provision of the organizational deed and bylaws of Buenaventura, (i)
          which would prohibit, conflict with or in any way prevent the
          execution, delivery or performance by Buenaventura of any of the
          Financing Agreements or which would result in the creation or
          imposition under the laws of Peru of any lien, security interest,
          charge or encumbrance of any nature upon any property of Buenaventura
          (except those created pursuant to the Share Pledge Agreement), (ii)
          that violate or conflict with, constitute (with notice or lapse of
          time, or both) a default under, or result in a breach of, any
          indenture, mortgage, lien, material agreement or other material
          contracts to which Buenaventura is a party or (iii) that violate or
          result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions or
          any order of any court arbitrator or governmental authority or
          regulatory body or Peru or contravene any law or regulation of Peru;
          except for application of Article 254 of the General Corporations Law
          (Ley General de Sociedades No 26887) under which any agreement
          regarding restrictions to the transfer of shares issued by a company
          organized as a sociedad anonima abierta will not be enforceable
          against such issuer.

     (4)  Each of the Financing Agreements has been duly authorized, executed
          and delivered by Buenaventura and constitutes the valid and legally
          binding obligation of Buenaventura enforceable against Buenaventura in
          accordance with its terms, except for (i) limitations that may arise
          from

          bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent
          conveyance or other similar laws that affect the rights of creditors
          generally; and (ii) application of Article 2049 of the Peruvian Civil
          Code under which provisions of a foreign law shall be excluded if they
          are incompatible with international public order or good customs.

     (5)  All authorizations, approvals, consents, filings, registrations and
          recordations that are necessary or advisable with respect to (i) the
          execution, delivery and performance of each Financing Agreement by
          Buenaventura, (ii) the validity or enforceability in Peru of the
          obligations of Buenaventura under any of the Financing Agreements and
          (iii) the admissibility in evidence in a court in Peru of the
          Financing Agreements have been made, and all stamp and other duties or
          taxes required to be paid thereon have been paid, except for the
          admissibility in evidence of the Completion Guarantee and the Transfer
          Restrictions Agreement, where the procedure described in paragraph
          (12) below shall have to be followed. No further authorization or
          approval of other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
          Peruvian governmental authority or any third party is required under
          the laws of Peru for the execution, delivery or performance by
          Buenaventura of any of the Financing Agreements.

     (6)  The Share Pledge Agreement has been executed through a notarized
          Peruvian public deed and registered in the Share Pledge Registry
          (Matricula de Acciones) of Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A or the
          Account Annotation (Anotacion en Cuenta) in CAVALI, as the case may
          be, creating a valid and fully perfected first ranking security
          interest upon the property purported to be covered thereby as security
          for the payment in full of the Secured Obligations, subject to no
          other equal or prior mortgages, pledges, liens, security interests,
          rights of reversion, assignments or other encumbrances or rights of
          others whatsoever enforceable in Peru against Buenaventura, any
          attaching creditor and third parties, except limitations that may
          arise from bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization,
          fraudulent conveyance and or other similar laws that affect the rights
          of creditors generally. No further approval, consent, authorization,
          notarization or other formality in Peru, and no notice to or filing
          with any Peruvian governmental authority or any third party, is
          required to be obtained or accomplished, and no fee, duty or tax is
          required to be paid, for the maintenance, preservation and continued
          perfection and first priority nature of such security interest and
          lien, or the remedies in respect of the collateral pursuant to the
          Share Pledge Agreement, except obligations that are mandatorily
          preferred by law, such as labour obligations.

     (7)  The choice of the law of the State of New York, United States of
          America, set forth in Section 9.05 of the Completion Guarantee,
          Section 4.03 of the Transfer Restrictions Agreement and Section 5(d)
          of the Consent are legal, valid and binding, and will be recognized
          and enforced by the Peruvian Courts, provided it is not incompatible
          with international public order or good customs.We have no reason to
          believe that any of the obligations under the Completion Guarantee,
          the Transfer Restrictions Agreement and the Consent are contrary to
          international public order or good customs, nor to Peruvian public
          policy (including public conduct and good morals) or any international
          treaties binding upon Peru or any of the generally accepted principles
          of international law.

     (8)  The submission by Buenaventura to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
          any Federal or State Court located in New York County in the City of
          New York, United States of America, set forth in Section 9.13(a) of
          the Completion Guarantee, Section 4.08(a) of the Transfer Restrictions
          Agreement and Section 5(d) of the Consent with respect to matters
          arising under or in connection with the Completion Guarantee, the
          Transfer Restrictions Agreement and the Consent is valid and effective
          under the laws of Peru, provided that such submission is not an abuse
          of law, is not contrary to Peruvian public order and the matter being
          submitted to such foreign Court is not subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of Peruvian Courts. In our opinion, the submission of the
          Completion Guarantee, Transfer Restrictions Agreement and the Consent
          to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal or State Courts
          located in the New York County in the City of New York is not an abuse
          of law, is not contrary to Peruvian public order and the matters
          therein referred are not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
          Peruvian Courts. However, if a claim is filed in a Peruvian Court, it
          could be disallowed by such Court upon request of the defendant if a
          claim on the same matter has been filed previously in a Federal or
          State Court located in the New York County in the city of New York, to
          avoid simultaneous or concurrent procedures and the risk of having
          different judgments on the same matter.

     (9)  Assuming that CT Corporation System has, under the laws of the State
          of New York, been duly appointed by Buenaventura as its agent to
          receive service of process in the State of New York, service of
          process made on CT Corporation System pursuant to such appointment
          will, under the laws of Peru, be considered served personally on
          Buenaventura and satisfy the conditions of Peruvian law.

     (10) A final judgment against Buenaventura for the payment of money
          obtained in any Court located in the New York County in the City of
          New York

          ("New York"), would be recognized, conclusive and enforceable in the
          Courts of Peru without reconsideration on the merits, so long as the
          following conditions are met:

     (1) if there is any treaty for the enforcement of judgments between Peru
     and the United States of America, the provisions of such treaty will apply;
     (2) in the absence of such treaty, the reciprocity principle is applicable,
     pursuant to which a judgment given by the Courts of New York will be
     admissible in the Courts of Peru and will be enforceable thereby, except if
     according to the laws of New York as interpreted or applied by the Courts
     of New York (i) judgments issued by Peruvian Courts are not admissible in
     the Courts of New York or (ii) judgments issued by Peruvian Courts are
     subject to reexamination by the Courts of New York, such reciprocity being
     presumed under the laws of Peru (3) in either case: (i) such judgment does
     not resolve matters which are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of
     Peruvian Courts; (ii) the Courts of New York is the competent jurisdiction
     under its own conflict of law rules and general principles of procedural
     jurisdiction; (iii) the defendant against whom the enforcement is sought
     has been summoned in accordance with the laws of New York and a reasonable
     term to appear before the Court as well as the procedural guarantees to
     defend his case were granted to the defendant in accordance with the laws
     of New York; (iv) the judgment has the authority of res judicata under the
     laws of New York; (v) there are no pending legal proceedings between the
     same parties related to the same matter, started prior to the filing of the
     complaint that concluded with the judgment issued by the Courts of New
     York; (vi) such judgment is not incompatible with another judgment meeting
     the admissibility and enforceability requirements required by Peruvian law,
     previously issued in respect of the same subject matter; and (vii) such
     judgment is not contrary to public order and good customs.

     (11) The submission by Buenaventura to the arbitration in accordance with
          the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules set forth in Section 9.16(a) of the
          Completion Guarantee for the resolution of any dispute on the matters
          expressly stated in such Section is valid and effective under the
          Arbitration General Law No. 26572 (Ley General de Arbitraje) and shall
          be enforceable in Peru without reconsideration of the merits.

     (12) To ensure the enforceability or admissibility in evidence in Peru of
          any document executed or granted outside Peru, including any document
          containing a judgment issued by the Courts of a place outside Peru,
          such document must be authenticated before the competent Consul of
          Peru and before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Peru. In addition,
          any document

          written in any language other than Spanish must be officially
          translated into Spanish by an official public translator in Peru prior
          to its submission for consideration of any Peruvian authority or its
          admission as evidence in any Courts of Peru, and such official Spanish
          translation would prevail over its original version.

     (13) There are no procedural bars to prevent the commencement of a
          proceeding against Buenaventura by a party to a Financing Agreement in
          a court of competent jurisdiction in Peru, pursuant to the terms of
          each Financing Agreement and based upon its obligations under a
          Financing Agreement and such courts would be prepared to accept
          jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, except that a court
          in Peru may decline to accept jurisdiction over an action or
          proceeding based on the principle of forum non conveniens as it is
          applied in Peru or based upon proceedings brought on the same cause of
          action in another jurisdiction and subject to Section 12.16(a) of the
          Master Participation Agreement, Section 9.13(a) of the Completion
          Guarantee, Section 4.08(a) of the Transfer Restrictions Agreement,
          Section 5 of the Consent and Section 14.2 of the Share Pledge
          Agreement.

     (14) There are no actions, suits or proceedings including arbitral duly
          served against, or to our knowledge (after due inquiry) threatened
          against or affecting Buenaventura or any of its assets that could
          reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect its ability
          to perform any of its obligations under the Financing Agreements or
          that question the legality, validity and enforceability of the
          Financing Agreements. Buenaventura is not in default with respect to
          any order, judgment or decree of any governmental authority or
          regulatory body or any arbitrator in Peru in a manner or to an extent
          that could reasonably be expected to have such an effect and there are
          no orders, judgments or decrees of any governmental authority,
          regulatory body or any arbitrator in Peru outstanding against
          Buenaventura or affecting its assets that could reasonably be expected
          to materially and adversely affect its ability to perform any of its
          obligations under the Financing Agreements.

     (15) The obligations of Buenaventura under each of the Financing Agreements
          rank pari passu with or senior to, in right of the payment, with all
          other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of Buenaventura, except
          obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law.

     (16) Buenaventura is subject to civil and commercial law with respect to
          its obligations under each of the Financing Agreements, and the making
          and performance by it of such Financing Agreements constitute private
          and

          commercial acts, rather than governmental or public acts. Neither
          Buenaventura nor any of its respective assets or properties has in
          Peru any immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal
          process in Peru (whether through service, notice, attachment prior to
          judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise).

     (17) It is not a condition to the ability of any Secured Party to bring a
          legal action in the courts of Peru against Buenaventura in respect of
          any Financing Agreement that such Secured Party has complied with any
          requirements in Peru necessary to enable it to do or carry on business
          in Peru. The Secured Parties are not and will not be deemed resident,
          carrying on business, subject to taxation as such or subject to
          environmental liability in Peru solely by reason of the execution,
          delivery, performance or enforcement of any of the Financing
          Agreements to which they are a party.

     (18) As of the date of this Legal opinion, Buenaventura owns [include
          number of shares] of the Borrower, all of which are free and clear
          form any pledge, lien or encumbrance, other than the Share Pledge
          Agreement and the Transfer Restriction Agreement.

     We are attorneys duly qualified to practice law in Peru and we express no
opinion herein as to any laws other than the laws of Peru as in effect on the
date hereof.

     This opinion is furnished to you solely in connection with the transactions
described above and may not be relied upon by anyone other than you and your
counsel in connection with such transactions.

                                        Very truly yours,

                                    INSURANCE

(A)  Insurance by the Borrower: The Borrower shall procure or cause another
     Person to procure at Borrower's own expense and maintain in full force and
     effect at all times on and after the Closing Date (unless otherwise
     specified below) and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement
     (unless otherwise specified below) insurance policies with insurance
     companies (i) having a Best Insurance Reports rating of "A-" or better and
     an financial size category of "VIII" or higher, or (ii) having a Standard &
     Poor's financial strength rating of "BBB+" or higher, or (iii) reasonably
     acceptable to the Administrative Agent, or (iv) of sound financial standing
     and good repute which does not meet any of above subsections (i), (ii) or
     (iii), subject to such insurers not constituting more that 10% of the total
     amount at risk on any one policy. Such insurance policies shall contain
     limits and coverage provisions sufficient to satisfy the requirements set
     forth in each of the Project Documents, but in no event less than the
     limits and coverage provisions set forth below. If an insurance company
     cannot meet the requirements of the above subsections (i), (ii) or (iv),
     the Administrative Agent may require that all or part of the risk be
     reinsured and that an agreement be in effect that allows the Borrower or
     Senior Facility Lenders direct access to any reinsurers for direct payment
     of premiums and losses; provided that, the provisions of any such
     reinsurance, including the rights of the Senior Facility Lenders and any
     limitation on the rights of the Borrower or Senior Facility Lenders, with
     regard to the reinsurers, shall be subject to the approval of the
     Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld)
     and (vi) any such reinsurers shall also be subject to the same financial
     approval standards as outlined above in subsections (i), (ii) and (iv).

     (1)  General Liability Insurance: Liability insurance on an occurrence
          basis against claims filed anywhere in the world and occurring
          anywhere in the world for the Borrower's liability arising out of
          claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and
          property damage. Such insurance shall provide coverage for
          products-completed operations, contractual liability, independent
          contractors and sudden and accidental pollution liability (which may
          be written separately on a claims made basis) with a $1,000,000
          minimum limit per occurrence for combined bodily injury and property
          damage. A maximum deductible or self-insured retention of $100,000 per
          occurrence shall be allowed.

     (2)  Automobile Liability Insurance: Automobile liability insurance for the
          Borrower's liability arising out of claims for bodily injury and
          property damage covering all owned (if any), leased, non-owned and
          hired vehicles of the Borrower, including loading and unloading, with
          a $1,000,000 minimum limit per accident for combined bodily injury and
          property damage. A


                                        1

<PAGE>

          maximum deductible or self-insured retention of $100,000 per
          occurrence shall be allowed.

     (3)  Excess Liability Insurance: Excess liability insurance on an
          occurrence basis covering claims (on at least a following form basis)
          in excess of the underlying insurance described in the foregoing
          subsections (1) and (2), with a $74,000,000 minimum limit per
          occurrence except for insurance applicable to the Sulfide Project
          where a $49,000,000 minimum limit is required.

          The amounts of insurance required in the foregoing subsections (1),
          (2) and this subsection (3) may be satisfied by Borrower purchasing
          coverage in the amounts specified or by any combination of primary and
          excess insurance, so long as the total amount of insurance meets the
          requirements specified above.

     (4)  Aircraft Liability Insurance: Aircraft liability insurance if the
          Borrower uses an aircraft (fixed wing or helicopter) that is owned,
          operated or chartered by the Borrower, for liability arising out of
          the operation of such aircraft. The insurance shall be provided for a
          combined single limit not less than $15,000,000 each occurrence and
          such limit shall apply to bodily injury (including passengers) and
          property damage liability. In the event the Borrower charters
          aircraft, the foregoing insurance and evidence of insurance may be
          furnished by the owner of the aircraft with the Borrower included as
          additional insured. In the event that a chartered aircraft hull is
          insured, such insurance shall provide for an insurer's waiver of
          subrogation in favor of Borrower.

     (5)  Construction All Risk Insurance: Property damage insurance on an "all
          risk" basis covering the Sulfide Project and insuring the Borrower and

(B)  Amendment of Requirements:

     (1)  Amendment by the Administrative Agent: The Administrative Agent
          (acting upon instructions from the Supermajority Facility Lenders) may
          at any time recommend amending the minimum insurance requirements and
          approved insurance companies of this Appendix II due to (i) new
          information not known by the Senior Facility Lenders on the Closing
          Date which poses a material risk to the Project or (ii) changed
          circumstances after the Closing Date which in the reasonable judgment
          of the Administrative Agent renders such coverage materially
          inadequate.

          The Administrative Agent shall provide notice to the Borrower along
          with a report setting forth the reasoning for the proposed amendment.
          The Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall negotiate the
          recommendation promptly and in good faith. The resultant agreed
          amended requirement(s) shall become effective on the next policy
          anniversary or renewal date unless otherwise agreed.

     (2)  Amendment Due To Commercial Unfeasibility: In the event any insurance
          or insurance related provisions (including the limits or deductibles
          thereof) hereby required to be maintained shall not be reasonably
          available and commercially feasible in the commercial insurance
          market:

          (i)  the Borrower shall have the right to request in writing a waiver
               from the requirement to maintain such insurance or to comply with
               such insurance related provision, which request shall be
               accompanied by a written report prepared by the Insurance
               Advisor, certifying that such insurance is "not reasonably
               available and commercially feasible" (and, in any case where the
               required amount is not so available, certifying as to the maximum
               amount which is so available) and explaining in detail the basis
               for such conclusions;

          (ii) the waiver shall be deemed to be granted if the Administrative
               Agent acting upon instructions from the Majority Facility Lenders
               does not object in writing to such request within 30 Business
               Days of receipt of the notice requesting such waiver;

          (iii) at any time after the effectiveness of any such waiver, but not
               more often than once a year, the Administrative Agent (acting
               upon


                                       8

<PAGE>

               instructions from the Majority Facility Lenders) may request, and
               the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent within
               sixty (60) days after such request, supplemental reports
               reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent from the
               Insurance Advisor updating their prior report and reaffirming
               such conclusion; and

          (iv) any such waiver shall be effective only so long as such insurance
               shall not be reasonably available and commercially feasible in
               the commercial insurance market.

          For purposes of this sub-section, insurance will be considered "not
          reasonably available and commercially feasible" if it is obtainable
          only at excessive costs which are not justified in terms of the risk
          to be insured and is generally not being carried by or applicable to
          projects or operations similar to the Sulfide Project or the Current
          Operations because of such excessive costs.

(C)  Borrower Conditions and Requirements:

     (1)  Loss Notification: The Borrower shall promptly notify the
          Administrative Agent of any single loss or event reasonably likely to
          give rise to a claim against an insurer for an amount in excess of
          $10,000,000 covered by any insurance policy after application of the
          deductible in the policy.

     (2)  Loss Adjustment and Settlement: A loss under the insurance policies
          providing construction all risk, operational property damage, delayed
          startup, marine cargo, marine cargo delayed startup or business
          interruption, shall be adjusted with the insurance companies,
          including the filing in a timely manner of appropriate proceedings, by
          the Borrower, who shall consult in good faith with the Administrative
          Agent if such loss is in excess of $10,000,000 after application of
          the deductible in the policy. In addition the Borrower may in its
          reasonable judgment consent to the settlement of any loss, provided
          that in the event that the amount of the loss exceeds $35,000,000 the
          terms of such settlement is concurred with by the Administrative
          Agent.

     (3)  Compliance With Policy Requirements: The Borrower shall not
          intentionally violate or permit to be violated any of the material
          conditions, provisions or requirements of any insurance policy
          required by this Appendix II, and without prejudice to Section B(2)
          above, the Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
          perform, satisfy and comply with, or cause to be performed, satisfied
          and complied with, all conditions, provisions and requirements of all
          insurance policies.

     (4)  Waiver of Subrogation: The Borrower hereby waives any and every claim
          for recovery from the Senior Facility Lenders for any and all loss or
          damage covered by any of the insurance policies to be maintained under
          this Agreement to the extent that such loss or damage is recovered
          under any such policy. If the foregoing waiver will preclude the
          assignment of any such claim to the extent of such recovery, by
          subrogation (or otherwise), to an insurance company (or other person),
          the Borrower shall give written notice of the terms of such waiver to
          each insurance company which has issued, or which may issue in the
          future, any such policy of insurance (if such notice is required by
          the insurance policy) and shall endeavor to cause each such insurance
          policy to be properly endorsed by the issuer thereof to, or to
          otherwise contain one or more provisions that, prevent the
          invalidation of the insurance coverage provided thereby by reason of
          such waiver. Multiple Insured Clause (Paragraph 7 deleted) shall apply
          under CAR/DSU policy. Waiver of subrogation requirements shall not
          apply to the construction liability policy.

     (5)  Evidence of Insurance: On the Closing Date and on an annual basis
          prior to each policy anniversary, the Borrower shall furnish the
          Administrative Agent with (1) evidence of insurance evidencing all of
          the insurance required by the provisions of this Appendix II. Such
          evidence of insurance shall be executed by each insurer or by an
          authorized representative of each insurer where it is not practical
          for such insurer to execute the evidence of insurance itself. Such
          evidence of insurance shall identify the insurer, the type of
          insurance, the insurance limits and the policy term and shall
          specifically contain the special provisions enumerated for such
          insurance required by this Appendix II. Upon request, the Borrower
          will promptly furnish the Administrative Agent with copies of all
          insurance policies, reinsurance policies, binders and cover notes or
          other evidence of such insurance relating to the insurance required to
          be maintained by the Borrower.

     (6)  Reports: On the Closing Date and annually thereafter within 10
          business days of the property insurance renewal or anniversary, the
          Borrower shall furnish the Administrative Agent with a report of a
          broker not directly employed with the Borrower, signed by an officer
          of the broker, stating that in the opinion of such broker, the
          insurance then carried or to be renewed is in full force and effect
          and is in accordance with the terms of this Appendix II and attaching
          a schedule of insurance policies required by the provisions of this
          Appendix II. The schedule of insurance shall include the name of the
          insurance company, policy number, type of insurance, major limits of
          liability and expiration date of the insurance policies.


                                       10

<PAGE>

          In addition the Borrower will advise the Administrative Agent in
          writing promptly of (1) failure to maintain insurance in compliance
          with the minimum insurance required by this Appendix II and (2) any
          default in the payment of any premium and of any other act or omission
          on the part of the Borrower which may invalidate or render
          unenforceable, in whole or in part, any insurance being maintained by
          the Borrower pursuant to this Appendix II.

(D)  Insurance Policy Conditions and Requirements

     (1)  Loss Survey: All policies of insurance required to be maintained
          pursuant to this Appendix II, wherein more than one insurer provides
          the coverage on any single policy, shall have clause (or a separate
          agreement among the insurers) wherein all insurers have agreed upon
          the employment of a single firm to survey and investigate all losses
          on behalf of the insurers. Where the insurer(s) on any single policy
          do not meet the financial rating requirements specified in this
          Appendix II, the provisions of this clause shall also apply to all
          reinsurers where the reinsurers and insurers will have agreed upon a
          firm with authority to survey and investigate losses on behalf of all
          insurers and reinsurers.

     (2)  Policy Cancellation and Change: All policies of insurance or
          reinsurance required to be maintained pursuant to this Appendix II
          shall be endorsed so that if at any time they are canceled (by any
          party including the insured) so as to affect the interests of the
          Senior Facility Lenders, such cancellation shall not be effective as
          to the Senior Facility Lenders for 60 days (30 days for marine
          cargo/DSU), except for non-payment of premium which shall be for 10
          days, after notification to the Administrative Agent of written notice
          from such insurer of such cancellation or reduction. Where it is
          impossible for the Borrower to obtain agreement from insurers for such
          notice, an agreement with its insurance broker to provide the notice
          will be acceptable.

     (3)  Miscellaneous Policy Provisions: The portions of the insurance
          policies providing the required construction all risk, operational
          property damage, delayed startup, marine cargo, marine cargo delayed
          startup or business interruption insurance shall (i) not include any
          annual or term aggregate limits of liability except for the delayed
          startup limit and the perils of flood, earth movement and terrorism,
          (ii) have any aggregate limits of liability apply separately with
          respect to the Facility excluding flood, (iii) not include a clause
          requiring the payment of additional premium to reinstate the limits
          after loss (excluding the construction all risk, delayed startup
          insurance and the perils of flood, earth movement and terrorism
          provided under the operational property and business interruption
          insurance), (iv) include the


                                       11

<PAGE>

          Senior Facility Lenders as additional insureds as their interest may
          appear, (v) with the exception of the marine cargo/DSU, CAR and
          delayed startup policy, include a clause requiring the insurer to make
          final payment on any claim within 60 days after the submission of
          proof of loss and its acceptance by the insurer and (vi) shall be
          denominated and losses payable in Dollars.

     (4)  Separation of Interests: All policies shall insure the interests of
          the Senior Facility Lenders regardless of any breach or violation by
          the Borrower or any other party of warranties, declarations or
          conditions contained in such policies, any action or inaction of the
          Borrower or others, or any foreclosure relating to the Project or any
          change in ownership of all or any portion of the Project. This section
          does not apply to the marine cargo survey warranty. This requirement
          can be met by the use of a mortgagee clause substantially similar to
          form 438BFU or the multi-insured clause. The construction all risk
          policy is subject to the multiple insured clause with paragraph 7
          deleted.

     (5)  Liability Insurance Endorsements: All policies of liability insurance
          required to be maintained by the Borrower shall be endorsed as
          follows:

          (a)  To name the Senior Facility Lenders as additional insureds;

          (b)  To provide a severability of interests and/or cross liability
               clause or a separation of insureds clause;

          (c)  Other than the automobile liability insurance, that the insurance
               shall be primary and not excess to or contributing with any
               insurance or self-insurance maintained by the Senior Facility
               Lenders, and

          (d)  Maintain policies denominated and losses payable in Dollars (to
               the extent permitted by Peruvian laws and regulations from time
               to time).

     (6)  Payment of Loss Proceeds: The insurance policies providing
          construction all risk, operational property damage, delayed startup,
          marine cargo, marine cargo delayed startup or business interruption,
          if issued outside of Peru or reinsurance policies if the primary
          policies are issued within Peru, shall specify that the proceeds of
          such policies shall be payable solely to the Trustee for deposit in
          the Proceeds Account. All proceeds paid within Peru from such policies
          shall be paid to the Onshore Collateral Agent for deposit into the
          Onshore Dollars Account or the Onshore Nuevo Soles Account as
          applicable.


                                       12

<PAGE>

(E)  Failure to Maintain Insurance: In the event the Borrower fails, or fails to
     cause the Contractor or the Operator, to take out or maintain the full
     insurance coverage required by this Appendix II, the Administrative Agent,
     upon 30 days' prior notice (unless the aforementioned insurance would lapse
     within such period, in which event notice should be given as soon as
     reasonably possible) to the Borrower of any such failure, may (but shall
     not be obligated to) take out the required policies of insurance and pay
     the premiums on the same. All amounts so advanced thereof by the
     Administrative Agent shall become an additional obligation of the Borrower
     to the Administrative Agent, and the Borrower shall forthwith pay such
     amounts to the Administrative Agent, together with interest thereon at the
     Past-Due Rate from the date so advanced.

(F)  No Duty of Senior Facility Lenders to Verify or Review: No provision of
     this Appendix II or any provision of the Credit Agreement or any Project
     Document shall impose on the Senior Facility Lenders any duty or obligation
     to verify the existence or adequacy of the insurance coverage maintained by
     the Borrower, nor shall the Senior Facility Lenders be responsible for any
     representations or warranties made by or on behalf of the Borrower to any
     insurance company or underwriter. Any failure on the part of the Senior
     Facility Lenders to pursue or obtain the evidence of insurance required by
     this Agreement from the Borrower and/or failure of the Senior Facility
     Lenders to point out any non-compliance of such evidence of insurance shall
     not constitute a waiver of any of the insurance requirements in this
     Agreement.

(G)  Acceptable Policy Terms and Conditions: The portions of all policies of
     insurance required to be maintained pursuant to this Appendix II shall
     contain terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Administrative
     Agent. If the requirements of this Appendix II are satisfied through a
     global insurance policy maintained by PDC or any of its Affiliates, the
     requirements of this Appendix II shall be required to be satisfied by such
     policy only in so far as it relates to the Borrower.

(H)  Delayed Effective Date: Notwithstanding the foregoing, until December 1,
     2005, the Borrower will not be required to comply with the requirements to
     (1) maintain terrorism insurance, (2) have a business interruption
     indemnity period of 15 months but instead have an indemnity period of 12
     months and (3) have the earthquake aggregate limit apply separately to the
     Sulphide Facility.

(I)  Delayed Implementation Date: Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the
     suspension or termination of the Completion Guarantee for an Event of
     Political Force Majeure pursuant to Section 5.01 of the Completion
     Guarantee or Section 11.01 of the Master Participation Agreement, the
     Borrower will not be required to comply with the payment of loss proceeds
     requirement in Section (D)(6) of this
