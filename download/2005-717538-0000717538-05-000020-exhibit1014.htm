In case any such proceeding shall be brought against an Indemnified Party and it shall give notice to Stockholder of the commencement thereof, Stockholder shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall so desire (unless Stockholder is also a party to such proceeding and the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate) to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party and, after notice from Stockholder to such Indemnified Party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, Stockholder shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party under Section 6.2 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of such proceeding, in each case, subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If Stockholder assumes the defense of such proceeding, (a) no compromise or settlement thereof may be effected by Stockholder without the Indemnified Party's consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary Damages that are paid in full by Stockholder and (b) the Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its consent. If notice is given to Stockholder of the commencement of any proceeding and Stockholder does not, within fifteen (15) business days after the Indemnified Party's notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Party of Stockholder's election to assume the defense thereof, Stockholder shall be bound by any determination made in such action or any compromise or settlement thereof effected by the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good faith that (x) there is a conflict of interest between Stockholder and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such third party claim or (y) there are specific defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to Stockholder and which could be materially adverse to Stockholder, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume and direct the defense of such claim. In such an event, (i) Stockholder shall not be bound by any determination of a proceeding so defended or any compromise or settlement thereof effected without the consent of Stockholder (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) Stockholder shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel of Stockholder and one counsel to all the Indemnified Parties. In any event, except as otherwise provided herein, the Indemnified Party and Stockholder may each participate, at the expense of each, in the defense of such claim. All indemnification obligations of Stockholder shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7 hereof.</FONT></P>
