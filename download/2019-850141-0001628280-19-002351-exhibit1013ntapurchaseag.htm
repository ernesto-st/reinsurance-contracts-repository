Each party shall then be given an  opportunity to supplement the information, arguments and support included in its initial  submission with one additional submission, delivered concurrently to the Independent  Accounting Firm and the other party, to respond to any arguments or positions taken by                                 - 19 -  </FONT></DIV>

To the  Knowledge of the Seller Parties, each Independent Producer at such time was duly licensed as  required by applicable Insurance Law (for the type of business written, sold, produced or solicited  on behalf of the applicable Regulated Subsidiary), except for such failures to be so licensed which  have been cured, which have been resolved or settled through agreements with applicable  Governmental Authorities, which are barred by an applicable statute of limitations or which would  not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.          (c)   Since January 1, 2016, none of the Company or any of its Regulated Subsidiaries  has received any written notice from any Governmental Authority that an Independent Producer  is in material violation of any applicable Law applicable to the writing, sale, production or  solicitation of insurance policies for the Regulated Subsidiaries.

There exists no material breach or event of default with respect to any   Reinsurance Contract on the part of any Insurance Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the Seller   Parties, any other party thereto.  No Reinsurance Contract contains any provision providing that  the reinsurer may terminate, recapture, rescind, accelerate or declare the ceding company in breach  under such agreement by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other  Transaction Documents.         (d)   Since January 1, 2016, there has not been any dispute with respect to any material  amounts recoverable or payable by the Company or any of its Affiliates pursuant to any                                         - 34 -  </FONT></DIV>

Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has   entered into any agreement or is involved in any discussions or negotiations with the Internal   Revenue Service or any other Tax Authority, or otherwise has requested relief, regarding the Tax   treatment of the Insurance Contracts under applicable Law, including any failure of any Insurance   Contract to meet the requirements of Sections 72, 79, 101, 401-409A, 412, 415, 417, 419, 419A,   430-436, 457, 501, 505, 817, 1035, 1275, 7702, 7702A and 7702B of the Code.  Neither the   Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or has received notice of any federal, state, local   or foreign audits or other administrative or judicial Proceedings with regard to the Tax treatment   of any Insurance Contract, or of any claims by the purchasers, policyholders or intended   beneficiaries of the Insurance Contracts regarding the Tax treatment of (i) the Insurance Contracts   or (ii) any plan or arrangement in connection with which such Insurance Contracts were purchased   or have been administered. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any &#8220;hold   harmless&#8221; indemnification agreement, Tax Agreement or similar agreement under which the   Company or any of its Subsidiaries is liable for the Tax treatment of (i) the Insurance Contracts or  (ii) any plan or arrangement in connection with which such Insurance Contracts were purchased  or have been administered.                                         - 40 -  </FONT></DIV>

None of the life Insurance Contracts is a &#8220;modified endowment contract&#8221; within the meaning of  Section 7702A of the Code, except for any life Insurance Contract that is being administered as a  &#8220;modified endowment contract&#8221; and with respect to which the policyholder consented in writing  to the treatment of such contract as a &#8220;modified endowment contract&#8221; and has not acted to revoke  such consent. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all Tax reporting,  withholding, and disclosure requirements applicable to the Insurance Contracts and, in particular,  but without limitation, has reported distributions under the Insurance Contracts in compliance in  all respects with all applicable requirements of the Code, Treasury Regulations, and forms issued  by the Internal Revenue Service.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have maintained the  information necessary to determine the Insurance Contracts&#8217; qualification for any applicable Tax  treatment under the Code, to monitor the Insurance Contracts for treatment as &#8220;modified  endowment contracts&#8221; (if applicable), and to facilitate compliance with the Tax reporting,  withholding, and disclosure requirements applicable to the Insurance Contracts in the manner  required by the Internal Revenue Service.         (m)   Each Insurance Contract that is subject to Section 817 of the Code complies with,  and, at all times since issuance, has complied with, the diversification requirements applicable  thereto in all material respects, and the applicable Insurance Subsidiary is treated for federal Tax  purposes as the owner of the assets underlying such Insurance Contract.         (n)   Seller directly owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests of the  Company.  The Company directly owns in excess of ninety percent (90%) of the total voting power  and value of the stock of EEI and one hundred percent (100%) of the stock of each Subsidiary of  the Company other than EEI and the Insurance Subsidiaries.  EEI directly or indirectly owns one  hundred percent (100%) of the stock of NTAL and NTANY.         (o)   The Company is a disregarded entity under Section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury  Regulations.         (p)   In connection with the restructuring of Seller and its Subsidiaries that occurred at  the end of 2015, Seller did not file Form 1122 with regard to making a consolidated return election  to allow it and its subsidiaries to file a consolidated return for U.S. federal income tax  purposes.  However, Seller represents that, if it was required to file Form 1122 in order to allow  Seller to file such consolidated returns, it (i) qualifies for automatic relief under Rev. Proc. 2014- 24 and (ii) has documented in its files the conditions described in sections 3.02, 3.03, 3.04, and  3.05 of Revenue Procedure 2014-24, so that, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502- 75(b) and Revenue Procedure 2014-24, the Seller affiliated group is treated as if it properly filed  Internal Revenue Service Forms 1122 and thus the members of the Seller affiliated group were  allowed to join in the making of a consolidated return for 2015 and subsequent taxable years.                                          - 41 -  </FONT></DIV>

Subject to the occurrence of the Closing, Seller hereby assigns the Distribution Recovery Right to   Buyer.  Buyer may exercise the Distribution Recovery Right as necessary to satisfy the  Fundamental Seller Obligations after exhausting Buyer&#8217;s remedies against Seller.

For the avoidance of doubt, whether any distribution constitutes a Recourse Distribution will be   determined, with the benefit of hindsight, by comparing the net assets of Seller, immediately after   giving effect to such distribution, against the aggregate unpaid Fundamental Seller Obligations   that are outstanding at any time between the date of such distribution and the seventh (7th)  anniversary of the Closing Date.                                         - 65 -  </FONT></DIV>

ARTICLE VIII.                                 TAX MATTERS   The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and Seller  for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:         8.1  Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns.           (a)   Filing of Tax Returns.  Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause  to be filed (i) all Tax Returns that include the Company or its Subsidiaries and that are due to be  filed prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all U.S. federal, state and local consolidated, affiliated,  combined or similar Tax Returns that include Seller, the Company and the Company&#8217;s Subsidiaries  that relate solely to Pre-Closing Tax Periods.  Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file  or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries.  All Tax Returns  that include Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Company&#8217;s  and its Subsidiaries&#8217; past practice and custom unless otherwise required by applicable Law.          (b)   Review Rights.  Buyer shall provide Seller with drafts of all Tax Returns that Buyer  is obligated to prepare under Section 8.1(a) to the extent such Tax Returns include Pre-Closing  Tax Periods, no later than twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing thereof.  Seller shall  have the right to review and provide reasonable comments on such Tax Returns during the fifteen  (15) days following the receipt of such Tax Returns, which reasonable comments shall be accepted  by Buyer and reflected in the applicable Tax Return.          8.2  Straddle Periods.  For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to  determine the liability for Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period, the  determination of the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle  Period including and ending on, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning immediately  after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two  (2) taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which  began at the beginning of the day immediately after the Closing Date, and items of income,  premiums, gain, deduction, loss or credit (or other relevant Tax items) of the Company and its  Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods  on a &#8220;closing of the books basis&#8221; by assuming that the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries  were closed at the close of the Closing Date; provided, however, that (i) exemptions, allowances  or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and  (ii) periodic Taxes (other than income, franchise/capital, sales, use, or withholding Taxes) such as                                        - 69 -  </FONT></DIV>

(a)   Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any action   on the Closing Date that is outside the ordinary course of business, if such action could have the   effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of the Company, any Subsidiary of   the Company or Seller in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or increasing the liability of Seller   under this Agreement.          (b)   Buyer covenants that without the prior written consent of Seller it shall not, and   shall not cause or permit its Subsidiaries to, make or change any material Tax election, amend any   Tax Return, take any Tax position on any Tax Return, or compromise or settle any Tax liability,   in each case if such action could have the effect of increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax   asset of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or Seller in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax   Period or increasing the liability of Seller under this Agreement.

Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid any such refund to Seller within fifteen (15) days after receipt  thereof, reduced by any increase in the federal income taxes owed, in the aggregate, by Buyer or  its Subsidiaries attributable to such refund.

Seller shall pay or cause to be  paid any such refund to Buyer within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof, reduced by any  increase in the federal income taxes owed, in the aggregate, by Seller or its Subsidiaries attributable  to such refund.          8.4   Contests Related to Taxes.  Notwithstanding Section 9.5, in the event Buyer   receives notice of a claim by a Governmental Authority in respect of Taxes of the Company or its   Subsidiaries (other than Taxes imposed under any U.S. federal, state and local consolidated,   affiliated, combined or similar Tax Returns that include Seller, the Company and the Company&#8217;s   Subsidiaries) for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date (a &#8220;Tax Claim&#8221;), Buyer   shall give written notice to Seller of such claim; provided, however, that the failure to give such   notice shall not relieve Seller from any obligation under this Agreement unless Seller is actually                                         - 70 -  </FONT></DIV>

If the   Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense   thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the   Indemnitor; provided, that Indemnitee shall have the right to assume the defense and/or receive   reimbursement from Indemnitor for the costs and expense of such separate counsel if (i)   Indemnitor and Indemnitee are both named parties to the proceedings and Indemnitee shall have   concluded in good faith that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be   inappropriate due to actual or reasonably foreseeable differing interests between them or the   availability to Indemnitee of one or more defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one   or more of those that may be available to Indemnitor in respect thereof or (ii) Indemnitor fails to   diligently defend a Third Party Claim for which it has assumed defense.  The Indemnitor shall be   liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period  during which the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in  which the Indemnitee shall have not yet given notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above).   In no event shall the Indemnitee&#8217;s right to indemnification for a Third Party Claim be adversely  affected by its assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim.  All of the parties hereto shall  reasonably cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim.  Such cooperation shall include the  retention and (upon request) the provision to the other of reasonably requested records and  information that are relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making employees reasonably  available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any  material provided hereunder.  Whether or not the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a  Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not pay, settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party  Claim without the Indemnitor&#8217;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld, conditioned or delayed).  If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party  Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a Third Party Claim with the  Indemnitee&#8217;s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned  or delayed); provided, that the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third   Party Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i) includes a release   of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the   Indemnitee to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, (iii) does not include a statement or                                        - 76 -  </FONT></DIV>

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts   (including by facsimile transmission or electronic transmission in portable document format (pdf)),   which when taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.          10.15 Post-Closing Representation.  The parties acknowledge and agree that Winstead PC   (&#8220;Winstead&#8221;) has acted as counsel to the Company and one or more of its Subsidiaries prior to the   Closing Date.  Buyer expressly and knowingly consents to Winstead representing the Seller Parties   in any matter after the Closing that is or may be adverse to Buyer, the Company or the Company&#8217;s   Subsidiaries, including any matter arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction Document.    This consent constitutes an advance waiver of any conflict of interest claim against Winstead as a   result of such firm representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the   transactions contemplated hereby.  In addition, Buyer, on behalf of itself and the Company,   expressly and knowingly (a) acknowledges and agrees that all attorney-client privileged   communications between Winstead, on the one hand, and the Seller Parties, the Company or any   of the Company&#8217;s Subsidiaries (or any of their respective officers, directors, members, and   employees) on the other hand, to the extent arising in connection with the negotiation,   documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to the sole   and absolute control of the Seller Parties, (b) waives any and all rights to obtain or otherwise   control the disclosure of such communications, and (c) covenants and agrees not to assert any   rights whatsoever with respect to such communications, other than any rights customarily available  to an adverse party arising under applicable Law to obtain disclosure of such communications by  legal process.  The parties further agree that notwithstanding any law or rules to the contrary, all  confidential communications described in clause (a) of this Section 10.15 will, at the discretion of   Seller, remain privileged after the Closing and such privilege shall belong to Seller and not the   Company or any of its Subsidiaries unless finally adjudicated to be not privileged by a court of   law or unless waived under applicable Law.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a   dispute arises between the Buyer, the Company or their Affiliates and a third party (other than a   party to this Agreement or any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, the Company may   assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential communications by                                        - 82 -  </FONT></DIV>

At the Closing, Buyer shall, on behalf of the Seller,   deliver the Escrow Amount to Escrow Agent by wire transfer in immediately available funds  pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(iii) of the Purchase Agreement. Escrow Agent agrees to accept such  sums for deposit in escrow pursuant to the provisions of this Escrow Agreement and agrees to  promptly acknowledge to Buyer and Seller its receipt of the Escrow Amount. The Escrow  Amount together with any interest, income or profits earned thereon (&#8220;Income&#8221;) as a result of the  investment of the Escrow Amount in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof is hereafter referred to  as the &#8220;Escrow Fund&#8221;.          2.2   Separate Account; Investments.

Such records shall include appropriate adjustments for        disbursements, Income earned and losses incurred.                (b)   During the term of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Fund shall be        invested and reinvested by Escrow Agent in such investments (i) as shall from time to        time be (a) selected by Seller with respect to, in each case, eligible investments in        accordance with the investment guidelines set forth on the attached Exhibit A, which may        be amended from time to time by joint written consent of the Parties (such investments,        &#8220;Eligible Investments&#8221;), or (b) jointly selected by the Parties with respect to, in each case,        any investments that are not Eligible Investments (&#8220;Other Investments&#8221;), and (ii) which        are investments the Escrow Agent is able to hold.  The Escrow Agent shall have no        liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment selected as indicated in the        previous sentence or made pursuant to the instructions of the Seller with respect to        Eligible Investments or the joint instructions of the Parties with respect to investments        that are not Eligible Investments, as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to        its maturity or for failure of the Seller or the Parties, as the case may be, to give the        Escrow Agent instructions or joint instructions, as the case may be, to invest or reinvest        the Escrow Fund.  In the absence of written instructions from Seller with respect to        Eligible Investments, or joint written instructions from the Parties with respect to Other        Investments, as to the investment of the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Fund shall be held        uninvested.         2.3   Releases from the Escrow Fund.

Escrow Agent does not have any interest   in the Escrow Fund but is serving as escrow holder only and as having possession of the Escrow  Fund only for purposes of this Agreement.  All Income earned from investment of the Escrow  Amount shall, as of the end of each calendar, be reported as having been earned by Seller,   whether or not such Income was disbursed during such calendar year, and Seller shall take into   account for tax purposes all such Income and shall be entitled to any related deductions, credits   and losses.

This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of   (i) distribution or disbursement by Escrow Agent of the entire Escrow Fund in accordance with   the terms hereof, and (ii) upon receipt by Escrow Agent of a joint notice of termination signed by   an Authorized Person from each Party. Upon such receipt by Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall   promptly deliver the Escrow Fund, less the amount of fees, costs and expenses or other  obligations owed to Escrow Agent, as directed by the Parties in such joint notice of termination.           2.6   Authorized Persons. In connection with the execution of this Escrow Agreement,   each Party shall deliver to Escrow Agent an authorized persons&#8217; form (an &#8220;Authorized Persons   Form&#8221;) in the form of Exhibit D-1, in the case of Buyer, and Exhibit D-2, in the case of Seller,   which shall provide for the incumbency and specimen signature of at least two (2) officers or   other representatives of such Party authorized to act for and give and receive notices, requests  and instructions on behalf of such Party in connection with this Escrow Agreement (each such  officer or other representative, an &#8220;Authorized Person&#8221;).  From time to time, a Party may revise   their respective Authorized Persons Form by delivering to Escrow Agent a revised Authorized   Persons Form, which shall include the changes made to the previously given Authorized Persons   Form (a &#8220;Revised Authorized Persons Form&#8221;). However, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely   conclusively on the then-current Authorized Persons Form until Escrow Agent acknowledges  receipt of the Revised Authorized Persons Form to an applicable Authorized Person.                                       3                                         </FONT></DIV>

PROVISIONS CONCERNING ESCROW AGENT          4.1   Indemnification.  Buyer and Seller jointly and severally agree to indemnify,   defend and hold harmless Escrow Agent from and against any and all loss, liability, cost, damage   and expense, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees and expenses or other   reasonable professional fees and expenses which Escrow Agent may suffer or incur by reason of   any action, claim or proceeding brought against Escrow Agent, arising out of or relating in any   way to this Escrow Agreement or any transaction to which this Escrow Agreement relates, unless   such loss, liability, cost, damage or expense shall have been finally adjudicated to have been   directly caused by the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of Escrow Agent. The   provisions of this Section 4.1 shall survive the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent and the   termination of this Escrow Agreement.              4.2   Limitation of Liability.  ESCROW AGENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE,   DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY (I) DAMAGES, LOSSES OR EXPENSES   ARISING OUT OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREUNDER, OTHER THAN DAMAGES,   LOSSES OR EXPENSES WHICH HAVE BEEN FINALLY ADJUDICATED TO HAVE   DIRECTLY RESULTED FROM ESCROW AGENT&#8217;S BAD FAITH, GROSS NEGLIGENCE   OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT, OR (II) SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL   DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT   LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF   THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE   FORM OF ACTION.          4.3   Resignation or Removal.  Escrow Agent may resign by furnishing written notice   of its resignation to the Parties, and the Parties may remove Escrow Agent by furnishing to   Escrow Agent a joint written notice of its removal along with payment of all fees and expenses   to which it is entitled through the date of termination.  Such resignation or removal, as the case   may be, shall be effective thirty (30) days after the delivery of such notice or upon the earlier   appointment of a successor escrow agent, and Escrow Agent&#8217;s sole responsibility thereafter shall  be to safely keep the Escrow Fund and to deliver the same to a successor escrow agent as shall  be appointed by the Parties, as evidenced by a joint written notice filed with Escrow Agent or in  accordance with a court order.  If the Parties have failed to appoint a successor escrow agent  prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following the delivery of such notice of resignation or  removal, Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a   successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall   be binding upon the Parties.          4.4   Compensation.  Escrow Agent shall be entitled to compensation for its services as   stated in the fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit E.  The fee agreed upon for the services   rendered hereunder is intended as full compensation for Escrow Agent&#8217;s services as   contemplated by this Escrow Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that the conditions                                       5                                         </FONT></DIV>

If any provision of this Escrow Agreement or the application   thereof to any party or circumstance shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, the   remainder of this Escrow Agreement and the application thereof shall not be affected and shall  be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.         5.12  Survival of Certain Provisions.  Sections 2.4, 4.1, 4.4, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.14 hereof   shall survive termination of this Escrow Agreement.          5.13  Representations and Warranties.  Each of the parties hereto represents and   warrants (a) that this Escrow Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered on its   behalf and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance   with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,   reorganization, moratorium or other debtor relief laws and that certain equitable remedies may   not be available regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law, and (b) that the   execution, delivery and performance of this Escrow Agreement by it does not and will not  violate any applicable law or regulation.         5.14  USA Patriot Act.  No Party to this Escrow Agreement is (or will be) a person with   whom Escrow Agent is restricted from doing business with under regulations of the Office of   Foreign Asset Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;) of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of   America (including those persons named on OFAC&#8217;s Specially Designated and Blocked Persons   list) or under any statute, executive order (including the September 24, 2001 Executive Order   Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to   Commit, or Support Terrorism), or other governmental action, and is not and shall not engage in   any dealings or transactions or otherwise be associated with such persons.  In addition, Buyer   and Seller hereby agree to provide Escrow Agent with any additional information that Escrow   Agent deems necessary from time to time in order to ensure compliance with all applicable laws   concerning money laundering and similar activities. The following notification is provided to   Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, 31 U.S.C. Section   5318 (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;):  IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR   OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT.  To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and   money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and   record information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account, including any   deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other extension of credit, or other financial   services product.  What this means for depositors:  When a depositor opens an account, if such   depositor is an individual, a lender (including Escrow Agent) will ask for such depositor&#8217;s name,   taxpayer identification number, residential address, date of birth, and other information that will   allow the lender to identify such depositor, and, if such depositor is not an individual, Escrow   Agent will ask for such depositor&#8217;s name, taxpayer identification number, business address, and   other information that will allow the lender to identify such depositor.  Escrow Agent may also   ask, if such depositor is an individual, to see depositor&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license or other identifying   documents, and, if such depositor is not an individual, to see such depositor&#8217;s legal   organizational documents or other identifying documents.  In the event Buyer and/or Seller   violate any of the provisions of the Patriot Act and the regulations thereunder, such event shall   constitute a default hereunder and shall entitle Escrow Agent to exercise all of its rights and   remedies at law or in equity, including but not limited to terminating this Escrow Agreement.                                       10                                        </FONT></DIV>
