         SECTION 2.1 ADVANCES.

         2.1.1    Agreement to Lend and Borrow.

         Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, Lender
hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on the

         2.1.2    Additional Advances.

         Subject to and upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, Lender
agrees, at any time and from time to time on and after the Closing Date and
prior to the Maturity Date, to make Advances to Borrower, which Advances shall

         2.1.3    Limitation on Advances.

         Each Advance of the Loan shall be in the minimum increments of Fifteen

         2.1.4    Intentionally Omitted.

         2.1.5    Notice of Borrowing.

         Whenever Borrower desires an Advance hereunder, it shall give Lender at

telephonic notice (promptly confirmed in writing) of each Advance to be made
hereunder, at least three (3) Business Days prior to such Advance being made.
Each such notice (a "Notice of Borrowing") (i) shall be irrevocable, (ii) shall

         2.1.6    Disbursement of Funds.

         No later than 2:00 P.M., New York City time on the date specified in

in accordance with the wire

                                      -28-

<PAGE>

instructions provided by Borrower or (ii) by wire transfer into an account at
Lender's office as directed by Borrower, in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.

         2.1.7    The Note.

         Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of, and interest on, the
Loan shall be evidenced by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by
Borrower (together with any additional notes executed in connection with the
Loan, as any of the same may be amended, restated, modified or supplemented from
time to time, the "Note") which shall be secured by the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 2.2 INTEREST; LOAN PAYMENTS; LATE PAYMENT CHARGE.

         2.2.1    Payments.

              (a)      Interest. Interest on the outstanding principal balance
     of the Loan shall accrue from the Closing Date to the end of the Interest
     Period in which the Maturity Date occurs at the Applicable Interest Rate.
     Monthly installments of interest only shall be paid on each Payment Date
     commencing on the first Payment Date immediately succeeding the date on
     which the initial Advance occurs and on each subsequent Payment Date
     thereafter up to and including the Maturity Date for the Interest Period in
     which such Payment Date or Maturity Date occurs.

              (b)      All payments and other amounts due under the Note, this
     Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be made without any setoff,
     defense or irrespective of, and without deduction for, counterclaims.

         2.2.2    Interest Calculation.

         Interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan shall be
calculated by multiplying (a) the actual number of days elapsed in the period
for which the calculation is being made by (b) a daily rate equal to the
Applicable Interest Rate divided by three hundred sixty (360) by (c) the
outstanding principal balance.

         2.2.3    Eurodollar Rate Unascertainable; Illegality; Increased Costs.

         (a) (i)  In the event that Lender shall have determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest
error) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurodollar
market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR, then
Lender shall forthwith give notice by telephone of such determination, to
Borrower at least one (1) Business Day prior to the last day of the related
Interest Period, with a written confirmation of such determination promptly
thereafter. If such notice is given, the Loan shall bear interest at the
Adjusted Prime Rate beginning on the first day of the next succeeding Interest
Period. (ii) If, pursuant to the terms of this Section, the Loan is bearing
interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate and Lender shall determine (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Borrower absent manifest
error) that the event(s) or circumstance(s) which resulted in such conversion
shall no longer be applicable, Lender shall give notice thereof

                                      -29-

<PAGE>

to Borrower by telephone of such determination, confirmed in writing, to
Borrower as soon as reasonably practical, but in no event later than one (1)
Business Day prior to the last day of the then current Interest Period. If such
notice is given, the Loan shall bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate beginning
on the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Borrower have the
right to elect to have the Loan bear interest at either the Eurodollar Rate or
the Adjusted Prime Rate.

              (b)      If any requirement of law or any change therein or in
         the interpretation or application thereof, shall hereafter make it
         unlawful for Lender in good faith to make or maintain the portion of
         the Loan bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, (I) the obligation of
         Lender hereunder to make the Loan bearing interest at the Eurodollar
         Rate shall be canceled forthwith and (II) the Loan shall automatically
         bear interest at the Adjusted Prime Rate on the next succeeding Payment
         Date or within such earlier period as required by Applicable Law.
         Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay Lender (within ten (10) days of
         Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
         compensate Lender for any reasonable costs incurred by Lender in making
         any conversion in accordance with this Agreement, including, without
         limitation, any interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds
         obtained by it in order to make or maintain the Loan hereunder. Upon
         written demand from Borrower, Lender shall demonstrate in reasonable
         detail the circumstances giving rise to Lender's determination and the
         calculation substantiating the Adjusted Prime Rate and any additional
         costs incurred by Lender in making the conversion. Lender's written
         notice of such costs, as certified to Borrower, shall be conclusive
         absent manifest error.

                  (c)      In the event that any change in any requirement of
         any Applicable Law or in the interpretation or application thereof, or
         compliance in good faith by Lender with any request or directive
         (whether or not having the force of law) hereafter issued from any
         Governmental Authority, in each such case, which is generally
         applicable to all Lenders subject to such Governmental Authority's
         jurisdiction:

                  (i)      shall hereafter impose, modify or hold applicable any
         reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement
         against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or for the
         account of, advances or loans by, or other credit extended by, or any
         other acquisition of funds by, any U.S. office of Lender which is not
         otherwise included in the determination of LIBOR hereunder;

                  (ii)     shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the
         Eurodollar Rate, hereafter have the effect of reducing the rate of
         return on Lender's capital as a consequence of its obligations
         hereunder to a level below that which Lender could have achieved but
         for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration
         Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy) by any amount
         deemed by Lender to be material; or

                  (iii)    shall, if the Loan is then bearing interest at the
         Eurodollar Rate, hereafter impose on Lender any other condition, the
         result of which is to increase the cost to Lender of making, renewing
         or maintaining loans or extensions of credit or to reduce any amount
         receivable hereunder by any amount deemed by Lender to be material;

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

then, in any such case, Borrower shall promptly pay Lender (within ten (10) days
of Lender's written demand therefor), any additional amounts necessary to
compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount receivable which
Lender deems to be material. If Lender becomes entitled to claim any additional
amounts pursuant to this Section, Lender shall provide Borrower with written
notice specifying in reasonable detail the event or circumstance by reason of
which it has become so entitled and the additional amount required to fully
compensate Lender for such additional cost or reduced amount. A certificate as
to any additional costs or amounts payable pursuant to the foregoing sentence
submitted by Lender to Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. This
provision shall survive payment of the Note and the satisfaction of all other
obligations of Borrower under the Note, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

                  (d)      Borrower agrees to indemnify Lender and to hold
         Lender harmless from any loss or expense which Lender sustains or
         incurs to the extent it is a consequence of (I) any default by Borrower
         in payment of the principal of or interest on the Loan while bearing
         interest at the Eurodollar Rate, including, without limitation, any
         such loss or expense arising from interest or fees payable by Lender to
         lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the Eurodollar
         Rate, (II) any prepayment (whether voluntary or mandatory) of the Loan
         on a day that (A) is not the Payment Date immediately following the
         last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto or (B) is the
         Payment Date immediately following the last day of an Interest Period
         with respect thereto if Borrower did not give the prior written notice
         of such prepayment required pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
         including, without limitation, such loss or expense arising from
         interest or fees payable by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it
         in order to maintain the Eurodollar Rate hereunder and (III) the
         conversion (for any reason whatsoever, whether voluntary or
         involuntary) of the Applicable Interest Rate from the Eurodollar Rate
         to the Adjusted Prime Rate with respect to any portion of the
         outstanding principal amount of the Loan then bearing interest at the
         Eurodollar Rate on a date other than the Payment Date immediately
         following the last day of an Interest Period, including, without
         limitation, such loss or expenses arising from interest or fees payable
         by Lender to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to maintain the
         Eurodollar Rate hereunder (the amounts referred to in clauses (I), (II)
         and (III) are herein referred to collectively as the "Breakage Costs").
         This provision shall survive payment of the Note and the satisfaction
         of all other obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the other
         Loan Documents.

                  (e)      In the case that the Loan is affected by the
         circumstances described above, if any Advance has not yet been made but
         is then the subject of a Notice of Borrowing, Borrower shall be deemed
         to have canceled and rescinded such notice.

         2.2.4    Payment on Maturity Date.

         Borrower shall pay to Lender on (or, to the extent permitted herein,
before) the Maturity Date the outstanding principal balance, all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, and all other amounts due hereunder and under the Note,
the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, all interest that would accrue on the outstanding

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

principal balance of the Loan through and including the end of the Interest
Period in which the Maturity Date occurs (even if such Interest Period extends
beyond the Maturity Date).

         2.2.5    Intentionally Omitted.

         2.2.6    Late Payment Charge.

         If any principal, interest or any other sums due under the Loan
Documents is not paid by Borrower on the date on which it is due, Borrower shall
pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of five percent (5%) of
such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by Applicable Law in order to
defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such delinquent
payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such delinquent
payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Security Instruments and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by Applicable Law; provided,
however, Borrower shall have the option, not to be exercised more than three (3)
times during the term of the Loan, to not pay the late payment charge
contemplated by this Section 2.2.6 in the event any Monthly Debt Service Payment
Amount is paid within one (1) Business Day after the date the same was due.

         2.2.7    Usury Savings.

         This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If,
by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower is at any
time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due
hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Applicable Interest
Rate or the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately
reduced to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the
Maximum Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of
principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or
agreed to be paid to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums
due under the Loan, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be
amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of
the Loan until payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account
of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time
in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

         2.2.8    Foreign Taxes.

         If the Loan is bearing interest at the Eurodollar Rate, all payments
made by Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of, and without
reduction for or on account of, Foreign Taxes, excluding, in the case of Lender,
Foreign Taxes measured by its net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by
the jurisdiction under the laws of which Lender is resident or organized, or any
political subdivision thereof and, in the case of Lender, taxes measured by its
overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of
Lender's lending office or any political subdivision thereof or in which Lender
is resident or engaged in business. If any non-excluded Foreign Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts payable to Lender hereunder, the
amounts so payable to Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to

                                      -32-

<PAGE>

yield to Lender (after payment of all non-excluded Foreign Taxes) interest or
any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rate or in the amounts specified
hereunder. Whenever any non-excluded Foreign Tax is payable pursuant to
Applicable Law by Borrower, Borrower shall send to Lender an original official
receipt showing payment of such non-excluded Foreign Tax or other evidence of
payment reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby indemnifies Lender
for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by
Lender which may result from any failure by Borrower to pay any such
non-excluded Foreign Tax when due to the appropriate taxing authority or any
failure by Borrower to remit to Lender the required receipts or other required
documentary evidence, provided, however, in the event that Lender or any
successor and/or assign of Lender is not incorporated under the laws of the
United States of America or a state thereof Lender agrees that, prior to the
first date on which any payment is due such entity hereunder, it will deliver to
Borrower (i) two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or successor applicable form, as the case may be,
certifying in each case that such entity is entitled to receive payments under
the Note, without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, or (ii) an Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or successor applicable
form, as the case may be, to establish an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax. Each entity required to deliver to Borrower a Form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI or Form W-9 pursuant to the preceding sentence further undertakes to
deliver to Borrower two further copies of the said letter and W-8BEN or W-8ECI
or Form W-9, or successor applicable forms, or other manner of certification, as
the case may be, on or before the date that any such letter or form expires
(which, in the case of the Form W-8ECI, is the last day of each U.S. taxable
year of the non-U.S. entity) or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any
event requiring a change in the most recent letter and form previously delivered
by it to Borrower, and such other extensions or renewals thereof as may
reasonably be requested by Borrower, certifying in the case of a Form W-8BEN or
W-8ECI that such entity is entitled to receive payments under the Note without
deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless in
any such case an event (including, without limitation, any change in treaty, law
or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would
otherwise be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
prevent such entity from duly completing and delivering any such letter or form
with respect to it and such entity advises Borrower that it is not capable of
receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United States federal
income tax, and in the case of a Form W-9, establishing an exemption from United
States backup withholding tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such entity
fails to provide a duly completed Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI or other applicable form
and, under Applicable Law, in order to avoid liability for Foreign Taxes,
Borrower is required to withhold on payments made to such entity that has failed
to provide the applicable form, Borrower shall be entitled to withhold the
appropriate amount of Foreign Taxes. In such event, Borrower shall promptly
provide to such entity evidence of payment of such Foreign Taxes to the
appropriate taxing authority and shall promptly forward to such entity any
official tax receipts or other documentation with respect to the payment of the
Foreign Taxes as may be issued by the taxing authority.

         2.3.1    Voluntary Prepayments.

         Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2
hereof, Borrower shall not have the right to prepay the Loan, in whole or in
part.

                  (a)      On any Business Day during a Permitted Prepayment
         Period, Borrower may, at its option, prepay the Loan in whole, but not
         in part, without penalty or premium, upon satisfaction of the following
         conditions:

                           (i)      Borrower shall provide prior written notice
                  to Lender specifying the Prepayment Date upon which the
                  prepayment is to be made, which notice shall be delivered to
                  Lender not less than five (5) Business Days prior to such
                  payment.

                           (ii)     Borrower shall pay to Lender, simultaneously
                  with such prepayment, (i) Breakage Costs, if any; and (ii) all
                  other sums then due under this Agreement, the Note or the
                  other Loan Documents.

                  (b)      In the event that Lender has failed to give Borrower
         a Conversion Notice (that ultimately results in the consummation of a
         Conversion) for a period of two hundred seventy (270) consecutive
         calendar days, beginning on any Business Day thereafter and ending on
         the Business Day Borrower receives such a Conversion Notice, Borrower
         may, at its option, prepay the Loan in whole, but not in part, without
         penalty or premium, upon satisfaction of the following conditions:

                           (i)      Borrower shall provide prior written notice
                  to Lender specifying the Prepayment Date upon which the
                  prepayment is to be made, which notice shall be delivered to
                  Lender not less than five (5) Business Days prior to such
                  payment.

                           (ii)     Borrower shall pay to Lender, simultaneously
                  with such prepayment, (i) Breakage Costs, if any; and (ii) all
                  other sums then due under this Agreement, the Note or the
                  other Loan Documents.

         2.3.2    Mandatory Prepayments.

                  (a)      If at any time, the outstanding principal balance of
         the Loan shall exceed the then Available Facility Amount, Borrower
         shall be required to (i) prepay the Loan (within five (5) Business Days
         of written notice from Lender), without penalty or premium, such that
         the Available Facility Amount shall equal the outstanding balance of
         the Loan or (ii) within forty-five (45) calendar days of written notice
         from Lender, encumber not more than two (2) additional Properties by
         the Lien of the Security Instruments, which Properties shall be

         hereof such that the Available Facility Amount shall equal or exceed
         the outstanding balance of the Loan.

                  (b)      On the next occurring Payment Date following the date
         on which Borrower actually receives any Net Proceeds, if and to the
         extent Lender is not obligated to make such

         Net Proceeds available to Borrower for the Restoration of a Property,
         Borrower shall prepay, without penalty or premium, the outstanding

         (100%) of such Net Proceeds.

         2.3.3    Prepayments After Default.

         If, following an uncured Event of Default, Borrower tenders payment of
all or any part of the outstanding principal of the Debt, or if all or any
portion of the outstanding principal of the Debt is recovered by Lender after
such Event of Default such tender or recovery shall be deemed a voluntary
prepayment by Borrower in violation of the prohibition against prepayment of the
Loan and Borrower shall pay, in addition to the outstanding principal of the
Debt, (i) all accrued and unpaid interest calculated at the Applicable Interest
Rate on the amount of principal being prepaid through and including the
Prepayment Date, (ii) a prepayment consideration equal to two percent (2%) of

not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the first Business Day
succeeding such scheduled due date.

         2.3.5    Application of Prepayments.

         All prepayments received pursuant to this Section 2.3 and all proceeds

outstanding principal balance being prepaid that accrued through and including
the Prepayment Date, third to interest on the outstanding principal balance
being prepaid that would have accrued through the end of the Interest Period in
which the prepayment occurred, notwithstanding that such Interest Period extends
beyond the date of prepayment, and fourth, to the reduction of principal.

         SECTION 2.4 RELEASE OF EXCLUDED PROPERTY.

         Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower
may obtain the release of an Excluded Property from the Lien of the Security
Instrument thereon (and related Loan Documents) and the release of Borrower's
obligations under the Loan Documents with respect to such Excluded Property
(other than those expressly stated to survive), but only upon the satisfaction
of each of the following conditions:

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

                  (a)      Borrower shall provide Lender with at least thirty
         (30) days but no more than ninety (90) days prior written notice of its
         request to obtain a release of the Excluded Property;

                  (b)      Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than ten
         (10) days prior to the date of such release, a release of Lien (and
         related Loan Documents) for such Excluded Property for execution by
         Lender. Such release shall be in a form appropriate in the State in
         which the Excluded Property is located and shall contain standard
         provisions, if any, protecting the rights of Lender. In addition,
         Borrower shall provide all other documentation Lender reasonably
         requires to be delivered by Borrower in connection with such release,
         together with an Officer's Certificate certifying that (i) such
         documentation is in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements
         and (ii) the release will not impair or otherwise adversely affect the
         Liens, security interests and other rights of Lender under the Loan
         Documents not being released (or as to the parties to the Loan
         Documents and Properties subject to the Loan Documents not being
         released);

                  (c)      Intentionally Omitted;

                  (d)      In the event the Release Property is subject to an
         Operating Lease along with one or more additional Properties, Lender
         shall have received a certified copy of an amendment to the Operating
         Lease reflecting the deletion of the Property to be released; and

                  (e)      Lender shall have received payment of all Lender's
         reasonable costs and expenses, including due diligence review costs and
         reasonable counsel fees and disbursements incurred in connection with
         the release of the Excluded Property from the Lien of the related
         Security Instrument and the review and approval of the documents and
         information required to be delivered in connection therewith.

         SECTION 2.5 RELEASE AND SUBSTITUTION OF COLLATERAL.

         Subject to the terms of this Section, Borrower may obtain a release of
the Lien of a Security Instrument (and the related Loan Documents) encumbering a
Property (a "Release Property") by substituting therefor another hotel property
acquired by Borrower (individually, a "Substitute Property" and collectively,
the "Substitute Properties"), provided that the following conditions precedent
are satisfied:

                  (a)      Borrower shall not have the right to release and
         substitute more than three (3) Properties in accordance with this
         Section unless such the Release Property is an Excluded Property, in
         which case the limitations contained in this sentence shall not apply.
         Any Substitute Property shall, among other things, require approval by
         Lender's internal credit committee(s) prior to being encumbered by a
         Security Instrument pursuant to the terms hereof.

                  (b)      Lender shall have received at least thirty (30) days
         prior written notice requesting the substitution and identifying the
         Substitute Property and Release Property.

                                      -36-

<PAGE>

                  (c)      If the Borrower continues to own a Property subject
         to the Lien of a Security Instrument, Lender shall have received (i) a
         copy of a deed conveying all of Borrower's right, title and interest in
         and to the Release Property to a Person other than Borrower or
         Principal pursuant to an arms length transaction and (ii) a letter from
         Borrower countersigned by a title insurance company acknowledging
         receipt of such deed and agreeing to record such deed in the real
         estate records for the county in which the Release Property is located.

                  (d)      Unless Lender shall have consented in writing to a
         lower appraised value, Lender shall have received a current Appraisal
         (which Appraisal shall be ordered by Lender and paid for by Borrower)
         of (i) the Substitute Property and (ii) the Release Property, each
         prepared within sixty (60) days prior to the release and substitution,
         showing an appraised value of the Substitute Property equal to or
         greater than one hundred percent (100%) of (A) the appraised value of
         the Release Property as of the Closing Date and (B) the appraised value
         of the Release Property immediately prior to the date of the proposed
         substitution.

                  (e)      Unless Lender shall have consented in writing to a
         lower Underwritten Cash Flow, Lender shall have received a certificate
         of Borrower certifying, together with other evidence satisfactory to
         Lender that, the Underwritten Cash Flow for the twelve (12) months
         immediately preceding the substitution with respect to the Substitute
         Property is equal to or greater than the Underwritten Cash Flow for the
         twelve (12) full calendar months immediately preceding the date of the
         proposed substitution with respect to the Release Property.

                  (f)      Lender shall have consented in writing to such
         release and substitution, which consent shall be given in Lender's
         reasonable discretion, and shall be based upon, among other things, (i)
         revenue per available room, (ii) occupancy rates, (iii) the revenue per
         available room penetration index, (iv) operating cash flow, (v) quality
         of the Franchisor and Manager and (vi) general trends of the Release
         Property and the Substitute Property with respect to (i), (ii), (iii),
         (iv) and (v) above, all as determined by Lender in its reasonable
         discretion.

                  (g)      Unless such event or condition relates solely to the
         Release Property and will be fully cured by the release and
         substitution, no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
         and Borrower shall be in compliance in all material respects with all
         terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in each other Loan
         Document on Borrower's part to be observed or performed. Lender shall
         have received a certificate from Borrower confirming the foregoing,
         stating that the representations and warranties contained in this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all
         material respects on and as of the date of the release and substitution
         with respect to Borrower, the Properties and the Substitute Property
         and containing any other representations and warranties with respect to
         Borrower, the Properties, the Substitute Property or the Loan as Lender
         may require, unless such certificate would be inaccurate, such
         certificate to be in form and substance satisfactory to Lender.

                  (h)      Borrower shall (A) have executed, acknowledged and
         delivered to Lender (I) a Security Instrument, an Assignment of Leases
         and two UCC-1 Financing Statements with respect to the Substitute
         Property, together with a letter from Borrower countersigned by a title
         insurance company acknowledging receipt of such Security Instrument,
         Assignment of Leases and UCC-1 Financing Statements and agreeing to
         record or file, as applicable, such Security Instrument, Assignment of
         Leases and one of the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the real estate
         records for the county in which the Substitute Property is located and
         to file one of the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the office of the
         Secretary of State (or other central filing office) of the State in
         which the Substitute Property is located, so as to effectively create
         upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable first priority
         Liens upon the Substitute Property, in favor of Lender (or such other
         trustee as may be desired under local law), subject only to the
         Permitted Encumbrances and such other Liens as are permitted pursuant
         to the Loan Documents and (II) an Environmental Indemnity with respect
         to the Substitute Property from Indemnitor and (B) have caused
         Guarantor to acknowledge and confirm its obligations under the Loan
         Documents. The Security Instrument, Assignment of Leases, UCC-1
         Financing Statements and Environmental Indemnity shall be the same in
         form and substance as the counterparts of such documents executed and
         delivered with respect to the related Release Property subject to
         modifications reflecting only the Substitute Property as the Property
         and such modifications reflecting the laws of the State in which the
         Substitute Property is located. The Security Instrument encumbering the
         Substitute Property shall secure all amounts then outstanding under the
         Note, provided that in the event that the jurisdiction in which the
         Substitute Property is located imposes a mortgage recording,
         intangibles or similar tax and does not permit the allocation of
         indebtedness for the purpose of determining the amount of such tax
         payable, the principal amount secured by such Security Instrument shall
         be equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the applicable
         CMBS Loan Amount for the Substitute Property.

                  (i)      Lender shall have received (A) to the extent
         available, any "tie-in" or similar endorsement, together with a "first
         loss" endorsement, to each Title Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of
         the existing Security Instruments as of the date of the substitution
         with respect to the Title Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of the
         Security Instrument with respect to the Substitute Property and (B) a
         Title Insurance Policy (or a marked, signed and redated commitment to
         issue such Title Insurance Policy) insuring the Lien of the Security
         Instrument encumbering the Substitute Property, issued by the title
         company that issued the Title Insurance Policies insuring the Lien of
         the existing Security Instruments and dated as of the date of the
         substitution, with reinsurance and direct access agreements that
         replace such agreements issued in connection with the Title Insurance
         Policy insuring the Lien of the Security Instrument encumbering the
         Release Property. The Title Insurance Policy issued with respect to the
         Substitute Property shall (1) provide coverage in the amount of the
         CMBS Loan Amount if the "tie-in" or similar endorsement described above
         is available or, if such endorsement is not available, in an amount
         equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the CMBS Loan
         Amount, together, if available, with "last dollar endorsement," (2)
         insure Lender that the relevant Security Instrument creates a valid
         first lien on the Substitute Property encumbered thereby, free and
         clear of all exceptions from coverage other than Permitted Encumbrances
         and standard exceptions and exclusions from

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

         coverage (as modified by the terms of any endorsements), (3) contain
         such endorsements and affirmative coverages as are then available and
         are contained in the Title Insurance Policies insuring the Liens of the
         existing Security Instruments, and such other endorsements or
         affirmative coverage that Lender shall require, and (4) name Lender as
         the insured. Lender also shall have received copies of paid receipts or
         other evidence showing that all premiums in respect of such
         endorsements and Title Insurance Policies have been paid.

                  (j)      Lender shall have received a current Survey for each
         Substitute Property, certified to the title company and Lender and its
         successors and assigns, in the same form and having the same content as
         the certification of the Survey of the Release Property prepared by a
         professional land surveyor licensed in the State in which the
         Substitute Property is located and acceptable to the Rating Agencies in
         accordance with the 1999 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for
         ALTA/ACSM Land Title Surveys. Such Survey shall reflect the same legal
         description contained in the Title Insurance Policy relating to such
         Substitute Property and shall include, among other things, a metes and
         bounds description of the real property comprising part of such
         Substitute Property (unless such real property has been satisfactorily
         designated by lot number on a recorded plat). The surveyor's seal shall
         be affixed to each Survey and each Survey shall certify whether or not
         the surveyed property is located in a "one-hundred-year flood hazard
         area."

                  (k)      Lender shall have received valid certificates of
         insurance indicating that the requirements for the policies of
         insurance required for a Property have been satisfied with respect to
         the Substitute Property and evidence of the payment of all Insurance
         Premiums payable for the existing policy period.

                  (l)      Lender shall have received a Phase I environmental
         report dated not more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
         proposed date of substitution and otherwise acceptable to Lender (which
         Phase I environmental report shall be ordered by Lender and paid for by
         Borrower) and, if recommended under the Phase I environmental report, a
         Phase II environmental report acceptable to Lender, which conclude that
         the Substitute Property does not contain any Hazardous Materials and is
         not subject to any significant risk of contamination from any off site
         Hazardous Materials.

                  (m)      Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
         Lender (A) updates or, if the Substitute Property is to be owned by an
         Affiliate of Borrower, originals, in either case certified by Borrower
         or such Affiliate, as applicable, of all organizational documentation
         related to Borrower or such Affiliate, as applicable, and/or the
         formation, structure, existence, good standing and/or qualification to
         do business delivered to Lender on the Closing Date; (B) good standing
         certificates, certificates of qualification to do business in the
         jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located (if required
         in such jurisdiction); and (C) resolutions of Borrower or such
         Affiliate, as applicable, authorizing the substitution and any actions
         taken in connection with such substitution.

                  (n)      Lender shall have received the following opinions of
         Borrower's counsel: (A) an opinion or opinions of counsel admitted to
         practice under the laws of the State in

                                      -39-

         terms, subject to the laws applicable to creditors' rights and
         equitable principles, and that Borrower is qualified to do business and
         in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction where the
         Substitute Property is located or that Borrower is not required by
         Applicable Law to qualify to do business in such jurisdiction; (B) an
         opinion of counsel acceptable to Lender stating that the Loan Documents
         delivered with respect to the Substitute Property pursuant to this
         Section, among other things, have been duly authorized, executed and
         delivered by Borrower and that the execution and delivery of such Loan
         Documents and the performance by Borrower of its obligations thereunder
         will not cause a breach of, or a default under, any agreement, document
         or instrument to which Borrower is a party or to which it or its
         properties are bound; and (C) an update of the Insolvency Opinion
         indicating that the substitution does not affect the opinions set forth
         therein.

                  (o)      Borrower shall (i) have paid, (ii) have escrowed with
         Lender or (iii) be contesting in accordance with the terms hereof, all
         Transaction Costs relating to each of the Properties and the Substitute
         Property, including without limitation, (x) accrued but unpaid
         Insurance Premiums relating to each of the Properties and the

         any in arrears) relating to each of the Properties and the Substitute
         Property and (z) currently due and payable Other Charges relating to

                  (p)      Borrower shall have paid or reimbursed Lender for all
         reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Lender (including, without
         limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) in connection
         with the release and substitution and Borrower shall have paid all
         recording charges, filing fees, taxes or other expenses (including,
         without limitation, mortgage and intangibles taxes and documentary
         stamp taxes) payable in connection with the substitution.

                  (q)      Lender shall have received annual operating
         statements and occupancy statements for the Substitute Property for the
         most current completed fiscal year and a current operating statement
         for the Release Property, each certified by Borrower to Lender as being

                  (r)      Upon the request of Lender, Borrower shall have
         delivered to Lender estoppel certificates from all tenants under Major
         Leases at the Substitute Property. All such estoppel certificates shall
         be substantially in the form approved by Lender in connection with the

         is a valid and binding obligation of the tenant thereunder, (2) to the
         best of the tenant's knowledge, there are no defaults under such Lease
         on the part of the landlord or tenant thereunder, (3) the tenant

<PAGE>

         Lease has been substantially completed and the tenant under such Lease
         is in actual occupancy of its leased premises. If an estoppel
         certificate indicates that all tenant improvement work required under
         the subject Lease has not yet been completed, Borrower shall deliver to
         Lender financial statements indicating that Borrower has adequate funds
         to pay all costs related to such tenant improvement work as required

         not available in the State in which the Substitute Property is located,
         a letter from the title insurance company issuing such Title Insurance
         Policy stating that the Substitute Property constitutes a separate tax
         lot or (B) a letter from the appropriate taxing authority stating that
         the Substitute Property constitutes a separate tax lot.

                  (v)      Lender shall have received a Physical Conditions
         Report (which Physical Conditions Report shall be ordered by Lender and
         paid for by Borrower)with respect to the Substitute Property stating
         that the Substitute Property and its use comply in all material
         respects with all applicable Legal Requirements (including, without
         limitation, zoning, subdivision and building laws) and that the
         Substitute Property is in good condition and repair and free of damage
         or waste or in the event such report indicates the need for immediate
         or on-going repairs at the Substitute Property, Lender shall have
         established a reserve in the amount of 125% of the estimated cost of
         completing such immediate or on-going repairs, provided, however, in no
         event shall Lender be obligated to accept a Substitute Property if the
         physical condition report relating to such Substitute Property
         indicates any damage or deficiencies which in Lender's reasonable
         judgment create a risk to the safety or well-being to the occupants of
         such Substitute Property.

                  (w)      Lender shall have received evidence satisfactory to
         Lender to the effect that all material building and operating licenses

         relating only to such Release Property, Lender shall have received a
         Replacement Management Agreement for the Substitute Property and the
         Manager thereunder shall have executed and delivered to Lender an

         Substitute Property or, in the event the Release Property is subject to
         a Operating Lease along with one or more additional Properties, Lender
         shall have received a certified copy of an amendment to the Operating
         Lease reflecting the deletion of the Release Property and, if
         appropriate, the addition of the Substitute Property as a property
         encumbered pursuant thereto.

                  (z)      Lender shall have received such other approvals,
         opinions, documents and information in connection with the substitution
         as reasonably requested by Lender.

         material contracts and agreements relating to the leasing and operation
         of the Substitute Property (other than the Management Agreement), each
         of which shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
         Lender.

                  (bb)     Lender shall have received certified copies of all
         material consents, licenses and approvals, if any, required in
         connection with the substitution of a Substitute Property, including,
         without limitation, liquor licenses and evidence that such consents,
         licenses and approvals are in full force and effect.

                  (cc)     Lender shall have received satisfactory (i.e.,
         showing no Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances) UCC searches,
         together with tax lien, judgment and litigation searches with respect
         to the Substitute Property and Borrower in the State where the
         Substitute Property is located and the jurisdictions where each such
         Person has its principal place of business.

                  (dd)     Lender shall have approved the applicable franchisor
         and, unless such franchise agreement is substantially in the same form
         and substance as the Franchise Agreements, the applicable franchise
         agreement and shall have received a Franchisor Estoppel and Recognition
         Letter from the franchisor under the Franchise Agreement, if any, for
         the Substitute Property, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
         to Lender.

                  (ee)     Lender shall have received certified copies of the
         most recent Quality Assurance Reports for the Substitute Property, if
         any which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender.

         (10) days prior to the date of such substitution, a release of Lien
         (and related Loan Documents) for the Release Property for execution by
         Lender. Such release shall be in a form appropriate for the
         jurisdiction in which the Release Property is located and shall contain
         standard provisions, if any, protecting the rights of Lender in and to
         the remaining Properties and regarding the Release Property to the
         extent of any surviving provisions of the Loan Documents relating to
         the Release Property.

                  (gg)     Borrower shall deliver an Officers Certificate
         certifying that the requirements set forth in this Section have been
         satisfied.

         Upon the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions precedent, Lender
will release its Lien from the Release Property and the Substitute Property
shall be deemed to be a Property for purposes of this Agreement.

                  All due diligence required to be delivered to Lender in
connection with this Section shall be in form, scope and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lender.

         SECTION 2.6 FEES.

         2.6.1    Non-Use Fee.

         Borrower shall pay to Lender a fee (the "Non-Use Fee"), computed at the

elapsed) of one-half of one percent (0.5%) on the average daily unfunded portion
of the Facility Amount, from and including the Closing Date through and
including the Maturity Date, payable, quarterly in arrears, on the Non-Use Fee

quarter (or on the Maturity Date, if applicable) of the amount of the Non-Use
Fee then due.

         2.6.2    Administration Fee.

         Borrower shall pay to Lender an administrative fee as compensation for
administering and servicing the Loan and performing its duties under this
Agreement and the Loan Documents equal to $10,000.00 per annum (the
"Administrative Fee") as the same may be pro-rated for any period of less than a
full calendar year. The Administrative Fee shall be paid in advance on the date
hereof and on the first day of each twelfth calendar month thereafter.

         2.6.3    Origination Fee.

              (a)      In consideration of Lender making the Facility Amount
     available to Borrower, Borrower shall pay to Lender an origination fee
     equal to one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Initial Available Facility
     Amount (the "Origination Fee") which shall be earned upon the signing of
     this Agreement and will be paid on the date hereof.

              (b)      In addition, upon demand, Borrower shall pay to Lender
     an additional origination fee (the "Additional Origination Fee") equal to
     one-half of one percent (0.5%) of any increase in the Available Facility

     to pay the Additional Origination Fee (i) to the extent that Borrower has
     previously paid an Additional Origination Fee based on the then current
     Available Facility Amount or (ii) in the event that Borrower irrevocably
     waives in writing the right to receive Advances in excess of the Initial
     Available Facility Amount.

         2.6.4    Termination Fee.

         Borrower shall pay to Lender a termination fee equal to the Termination
Fee upon the termination of this Agreement and the Loan pursuant to Section 2.11

         SECTION 2.7 INCREASING AVAILABLE FACILITY AMOUNT.

              (a)      In addition to the provisions of Section 5.3 hereof,
     Borrower may, prior to the Maturity Date and subject to the limitations set
     forth herein, increase the Available Facility Amount by offering to add not
     more than two (2) additional properties as security for the Loan and
     encumbering them with the Lien of the Security Instruments and the Loan
     Documents (each, a "New Property" and collectively, the "New Properties").
     If Lender determines that such New Properties are satisfactory to Lender in
     its sole discretion (including, without limitation, approval by Lender's
     internal credit committee(s)) and all the conditions in this Section and
     Section 3.1 are complied with, the Available Facility Amount shall be
     increased (when New Properties have been encumbered by the Lien of the
     Security Instruments and the Loan Documents) by the maximum amount equal to
     the lesser of (i) sixty percent (60%) of the appraised fair market value of
     the New Properties being added and (ii) that amount necessary to insure a
     Debt Service Coverage Ratio of at least 1.30:1.00, subject to the condition
     that each New Property be encumbered by the Lien of the Security
     Instruments and the Loan Documents prior to any increase in the Available
     Facility Amount and promptly following notification by Lender to Borrower
     that such New Property is satisfactory.

              (b)      In no event shall the Available Facility Amount be
     increased to more than the Facility Amount.

              (c)      In addition to the restrictions set forth above, at any
     time that the Available Facility Amount is to be increased at the request
     of Borrower, the following conditions precedent must be satisfied:

                    (i)      No Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing or would result from the consummation of the proposed
         addition of the New Property;

                    (ii)     The increase in the Available Facility Amount as a
         result of the addition of one or more New Properties pursuant to this
         Section 2.7 shall be equal to or in excess of $5,000,000 per New
         Property;

                    (iii)    Borrower has executed and delivered to Lender (at
         Borrower's sole cost and expense) all of the documents required under
         Section 2.5 for a Substitute Property and has complied with all of the
         conditions contained in Section 2.5 with respect to a Substitute
         Property;

                                      -44-

<PAGE>

                    (iv)     If requested by Lender and at no additional
         material cost to Borrower (other than with respect to legal counsel
         retained by Borrower), Borrower shall execute a new or amended Note
         covering the amount of such increase and provide to Lender such
         amendments, supplements, modifications or increases to the applicable
         Security Instruments and Loan Documents as Lender may deem reasonably
         necessary in connection therewith, which may include some or all of the
         documents or items required under Section 2.5 in connection with a
         Substitute Property and under Section 3.1 in connection with an
         Advance, and it is understood that any new Note shall be
         cross-defaulted with the other Note, Security Instruments and Loan
         Documents and cross collateralized with the Properties; and

                    (v)      No increase in the Available Facility Amount
         pursuant to this Section 2.7 may take place after ninety (90) days
         prior to the Maturity Date or the Extended Maturity Date, as
         applicable.

         SECTION 2.8 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

         SECTION 2.9 ADDITIONAL BORROWERS/OPERATING LESSEE.

              (a)      FelCor shall create additional entities for the purpose
     of adding any New Property to be encumbered by a Security Instrument, and
     each such additional entity ("Additional Borrower") shall be wholly owned,
     directly or indirectly, by FelCor and controlled by FelCor and shall upon
     execution of a Security Instrument be deemed to be a Borrower for the
     purpose of this Agreement and the Loan Documents. FelCor agrees to cause
     each such additional entity to execute a modification to this Agreement
     adding such additional entity as a Borrower hereunder. For any Advance made
     subsequent to the creation of such additional entity, such additional
     entity shall be required to deliver and execute documents and comply with
     the requirements of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the
     obligations to execute any Notes in connection with any further Advances).

              (b)      FelCor shall create additional entities to be the
     Operating Lessee of such New Property to be encumbered by a Security
     Instrument, and each such additional entity ("Additional Operating Lessee")
     shall be wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by FelCor and controlled by
     FelCor and shall upon execution of a Security Instrument be deemed to be a
     Operating Lessee for the purpose of this Agreement and the Loan Documents.
     FelCor agrees to cause each such additional entity to execute a
     modification to this Agreement adding such additional entity as an
     Additional Operating Lessee hereunder. For any Advance made subsequent to
     the creation of such additional entity, such additional entity shall be
     required to deliver and execute documents and comply with the requirements
     of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the obligations to
     execute any Notes in connection with any further Advances).

         SECTION 2.10 EXTENSION OF MATURITY DATE.

         Upon compliance with the Maturity Date Extension Criteria, Borrower may
extend the Maturity Date for one (1) additional six (6) month period (the
"Extended Maturity Date"). In

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

addition, Lender may, upon written notice to Borrower, extend the Maturity Date
or the Extended Maturity Date, as applicable, (a "Lender Extension") for a
period of not more than four (4) months if Lender determines in its sole
discretion that such an extended Maturity Date is necessary or desirable in
order to convert all or a portion of the Loan into Fixed Rated CMBS Loans
pursuant to the terms of Section 9.1 hereof. Borrower shall not be entitled to
any Advances (and Lender shall not be obligated to make any Advances) beginning
on the Maturity Date or Extended Maturity Date, as applicable.

         SECTION 2.11 TERMINATION OF LOAN.

              (a)      In the event the outstanding principal balance of the
     Loan does not exceed the Conversion Parameters for all hypothetical Fixed
     Rate CMBS Loans (taken individually, and not as a whole), upon at least ten
     (10) Business Days prior irrevocable written notice to Lender, Borrower
     shall have the right to terminate the Loan, this Agreement and reduce the
     Facility Amount to zero, provided that Borrower, on the date specified in
     such notice (the "Termination Date"), pays to Lender, the entire
     outstanding principal balance of the Loan, together with all interest
     accrued and unpaid thereon, all Breakage Costs, the Termination Fee, and
     all other sums due under the Note, this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents. From and after the Termination Date, Lender shall have no
     further obligation to make any Advances.

              (b)      From and after a Termination Date through and
     including Maturity Date or Extended Maturity Date, as applicable, in the
     event Borrower or any Affiliate thereof desires to obtain secured first
     lien mortgage financing for one or more Properties (a "Post-Termination
     Financing") then Borrower shall deliver to Lender written notice of its
     intention to obtain such Post-Termination Financing (the "Post-Termination
     Financing Notice"). Lender shall thereafter have an exclusive opportunity
     for a period of thirty (30) days following its receipt of the
     Post-Termination Financing Notice to issue a term sheet, application or
     similar loan quote for such Post-Termination Financing which shall be on
     terms and conditions substantially similar to those contained in (i)
     Section 9.1 or 9.2 hereof, as applicable (including, without limitation,
     relating to the applicable interest rate) and (ii) the Conversion Amended
     Loan Documents or Floating Rate Conversion Documents, as applicable (the
     "Financing Quote"). Lender shall be under no obligation to deliver the
     Financing Quote and said Financing Quote, if offered, shall in no way be
     construed as a commitment by Lender to engage in the Post-Termination
     Financing. After receipt by Borrower of the Financing Quote, Borrower and
     Lender shall thereafter proceed in good faith to (A) obtain approval by
     Lender's internal credit committee(s) of such Post-Termination Financing
     and, (B) if such approval is obtained, to promptly close the
     Post-Termination Financing pursuant to the terms of the Financing Quote.
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.11,
     nothing in this Agreement shall constitute either (i) a commitment by
     Lender for the Post-Termination Financing or (ii) an offer by Lender to
     make a commitment for the Post-Termination Financing.

<PAGE>

Borrower, Operating Lessee or any Property, which actions, suits or proceedings,
if determined against Borrower, Operating Lessee or any Property, would
reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect the condition (financial
or otherwise) or business of Borrower, Operating Lessee or the condition or
ownership of any Property.

         4.1.5    Agreements.

         Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee is a party to any agreement or
instrument or subject to any restriction which would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affect Borrower, Operating Lessee or any Property, or
Borrower's or Operating Lessee's business, properties or assets, operations or
condition, financial or otherwise. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee is in
default in any material respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of
any of the obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which Borrower, Operating Lessee or any
of the Properties are bound. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee has material
financial obligation under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower or Operating Lessee

and Operating Lessee's assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making
of the Loan, exceed Borrower's and Operating Lessee's total liabilities,
including, without limitation, subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and
contingent liabilities. Borrower's and Operating Lessee's assets do not and,
immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute unreasonably
small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed to be
conducted. Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee intends to incur debt and
liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its
ability to pay such debt and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the
timing and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and Operating Lessee and
the amounts to be payable on or in respect of obligations of Borrower and
Operating Lessee). No petition under the Bankruptcy Code or similar state
bankruptcy or insolvency law has been filed against Borrower, Operating Lessee
or any constituent Person in the last seven (7) years, and neither Borrower,
Operating Lessee nor any constituent Person in the last seven (7) years has ever
made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any
insolvency act for the benefit of debtors. Neither Borrower, Operating Lessee
nor any of its constituent Persons are contemplating either the filing of a
petition by it under the Bankruptcy Code or similar state bankruptcy or
insolvency law or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower's or
Operating Lessee's assets or property, and neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee
has any knowledge of any Person contemplating the filing of any such petition
against it or such constituent Persons.

occupancy of or involved with the operation or use of the Properties any act or
omission affording the federal government or any other Governmental Authority

     necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its

     material respects, with all Legal Requirements applicable to it and the
     Properties. There shall never be committed by Borrower or any other Person

     initiated and conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the validity
     of any Legal Requirement, the applicability of any Legal Requirement to
     Borrower or any Property or any alleged violation of any Legal Requirement,
     provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured;
     (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in

     subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder and such proceeding

     Property nor any part thereof or interest therein will be in danger of
     being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost; (iv) Borrower shall

     as necessary to cause compliance with such Legal Requirement at any time
     when, in the judgment of Lender, the validity, applicability or violation
     of such Legal Requirement is finally established or any Property (or any
     part thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of being sold,
     forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost.

the Other Charges prior to the date the same shall become delinquent (provided,
however, that Borrower is not required to furnish such receipts for payment of
Taxes in the event that such Taxes are being paid by Lender pursuant to the
terms hereof). Borrower shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and
discharged any Lien or charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge

in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost; (iv) Borrower
shall promptly upon final determination thereof pay the amount of any such Taxes
or Other Charges, together with all costs, interest and penalties which may be
payable in connection therewith; (v) such proceeding shall suspend the
collection of such contested Taxes or Other Charges from the applicable
Property; and (vi) Borrower shall furnish such security as may be required in
the proceeding, or as may be requested by Lender, to insure the payment of any
such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all interest and penalties thereon.

there shall be any danger of the Lien of any Security Instrument being primed by
any related Lien.

     effect and has not been modified, amended or assigned, (ii) neither
     Franchisor nor Operating Lessee is in default under any of the terms,
     covenants or provisions of the Franchise Agreement and Franchisor knows of

         5.1.16   Intentionally Omitted.

         5.1.17   Leasing Matters.

                  (a)      With respect to any Property, Borrower may (and may
         allow Operating Lessee to) enter into a proposed Lease (including the
         renewal or extension of an existing Lease (a "Renewal Lease")) without
         the prior written consent of Lender, provided such proposed Lease or
         Renewal Lease (i) provides for rental rates and terms comparable to
         existing local market rates and terms (taking into account the type and
         quality of the tenant) as of the date such Lease is executed by
         Borrower or Operating Lessee (unless, in the case of a Renewal Lease,
         the rent payable during such renewal, or a formula or other method to
         compute such rent, is provided for in the original Lease), (ii) is an
         arms-length transaction with a bona fide, independent third party
         tenant, (iii) does not have a material adverse effect on the value or
         quality of the applicable Property, (iv) is subject and subordinate to
         the related Security Instrument and, upon Lender's reasonable request,
         the lessee thereunder agrees to attorn to Lender and (v) is not a Major
         Lease. All proposed Leases which do not satisfy the requirements set
         forth in this Section shall be subject to the prior approval of Lender,
         which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. At Lender's request,
         Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender copies of all Leases which
         are entered into pursuant to this Subsection together with Borrower's
         certification that it has satisfied all of the conditions of this
         Section.

                  (b)      Borrower and/or Operating Lessee, as applicable, (i)
         shall observe and perform all the obligations imposed upon the lessor
         under the Major Leases and shall not do or permit to be done anything
         to impair the value of any of the Major Leases as security for the
         Debt; (ii) shall promptly send copies to Lender of all notices of
         default or other material matters which Borrower or Operating Lessee
         shall send or receive with respect to the Major Leases; (iii) shall
         enforce all of the material terms, covenants and conditions contained
         in the Major Leases upon the part of the tenant thereunder to be
         observed or performed (except for termination of a Major Lease which
         shall require Lender's prior written approval); (iv) shall not collect
         any of the Rents more than one (1) month in advance (except Security
         Deposits shall not be deemed Rents collected in advance); (v) shall not
         execute any other assignment of the lessor's interest in any of the
         Leases or the Rents; and (vi) shall not consent to any assignment of or
         subletting under any Major Leases not in accordance with their terms,
         without the prior written consent of Lender.

                  (c)      Borrower may (and may allow Operating Lessee to),
         without the consent of Lender, amend, modify or waive the provisions of
         any Lease or terminate, reduce rents under, accept a surrender of space
         under, or shorten the term of, any Lease (including any guaranty,
         letter of credit or other credit support with respect thereto) provided
         that such Lease is not a Major Lease and that such action (taking into
         account, in the case of a termination, reduction in rent, surrender of
         space or shortening of term, the planned alternative use of the
         affected space) does not have a material adverse effect on the value of
         the applicable Property taken as a whole, and provided that such Lease,
         as amended, modified or waived, is otherwise in compliance with the
         requirements of this Agreement

                                      -84-
<PAGE>

         and any lease subordination agreement binding upon Lender with respect
         to such Lease. A termination of a Lease (other than a Major Lease) with
         a tenant who is in default beyond applicable notice and grace periods
         shall not be considered an action which has a material adverse effect
         on the value of the applicable Property taken as a whole. Any
         amendment, modification, waiver, termination, rent reduction, space
         surrender or term shortening which does not satisfy the requirements
         set forth in this Subsection shall be subject to the prior written
         approval of Lender and its counsel, at Borrower's expense. At Lender's
         request, Borrower shall promptly deliver to Lender copies of all
         Leases, amendments, modifications and waivers which are entered into
         pursuant to this Section together with Borrower's certification that it
         has satisfied all of the conditions of this Section.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
         contrary, with respect to any Property, Borrower shall not (and shall
         not allow Operating Lessee to), without the prior written consent of
         Lender, enter into, materially amend, materially modify, waive any
         material provisions of, terminate, reduce rents under, accept a
         surrender of space under, or shorten the term of, or renew or extend
         upon terms and conditions less favorable to Operating Lessee, any Major
         Lease or any instrument guaranteeing or providing credit support for
         any Major Lease.

                  (e)      To the extent actually received by Lender, Lender
         shall hold any and all monies representing security deposits under the
         Leases (the "Security Deposits") received by Lender, in accordance with
         the terms of the respective Lease, and shall only release the Security
         Deposits in order to return a tenant's Security Deposit to such tenant
         if such tenant is entitled to the return of the Security Deposit under
         the terms of the Lease.

         5.1.18   Management Agreement.

                  (a)      The Improvements on the Properties are operated under
         the terms and conditions of the Management Agreement. In no event shall
         the base management fees under the Management Agreement exceed (I) with
         respect to the Properties managed by Six Continents Hotels, the sum of
         (x) five percent (5%) of total room revenue and (y) two percent (2%) of
         total revenue; provided, however, Six Continents Hotels shall not
         charge any additional franchise fees in connection with such Properties
         and (II) with respect to the Properties managed by any Person other
         than Six Continents Hotels, four percent (4%) of the gross income
         derived from the Property (excluding any incentive management fees
         which are subordinate to the Loan). Borrower shall (or shall cause
         Operating Lessee to) (i) diligently perform and observe all of the
         terms, covenants and conditions of the Management Agreement, on the
         part of Operating Lessee to be performed and observed to the end that
         all things shall be done which are necessary to keep unimpaired the
         rights of Operating Lessee under the Management Agreement and (ii)
         promptly notify Lender of the giving of any notice by Manager to
         Operating Lessee of any default by Operating Lessee in the performance
         or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of the
         Management Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed
         and observed and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such notice.
         Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall surrender the Management
         Agreement, consent to the assignment by the Manager of

                                      -85-
<PAGE>

         its interest under the Management Agreement, or terminate or cancel the
         Management Agreement, or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the
         Management Agreement, in any material respect, either orally or in
         writing. Borrower hereby assigns (and Borrower shall cause Operating
         Lessee to assign) to Lender as further security for the payment of the
         Debt and for the performance and observance of the terms, covenants and
         conditions of this Agreement, all the rights, privileges and
         prerogatives of Borrower and/or Operating Lessee to surrender the
         Management Agreement, or to terminate, cancel, modify, change,
         supplement, alter or amend the Management Agreement, in any material
         respect, and any such surrender of the Management Agreement, or
         termination, cancellation, modification, change, supplement, alteration
         or amendment of the Management Agreement in any material respect,
         without the prior consent of Lender, shall be void and of no force and
         effect. If Operating Lessee shall default in the performance or
         observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
         Management Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed or
         observed, then, without limiting the generality of the other provisions
         of this Agreement, and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any
         of its obligations hereunder, Lender shall have the right, but shall be
         under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any act or take any
         action as may be appropriate to cause all the terms, covenants and
         conditions of the Management Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee
         to be performed or observed to be promptly performed or observed on
         behalf of Operating Lessee to the end that the rights of Operating
         Lessee in, to and under the Management Agreement shall be kept
         unimpaired and free from default. Lender and any Person designated by
         Lender by written notice to Borrower shall have, and are hereby
         granted, the right to enter upon the applicable Property at any time
         and from time to time for the purpose of taking any such action. If the
         Manager shall deliver to Lender a copy of any notice sent to Borrower
         and/or Operating Lessee of default under the Management Agreement, such
         notice shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken
         or omitted to be taken by Lender in good faith, in reliance thereon.
         Borrower and Operating Lessee shall not, and shall not permit the
         Manager to, sub-contract all or any material portion of its management
         responsibilities under the Management Agreement to a third-party
         without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be
         unreasonably withheld. Borrower shall, from time to time, cause
         Operating Lessee to request of Manager and deliver to Lender upon
         receipt such certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance by
         Operating Lessee with the terms of the Management Agreement as may be
         reasonably requested by Lender. Borrower and/or Operating Lessee shall
         exercise each individual option, if any, to extend or renew the term of
         the Management Agreement to the extent required to continue it in full
         force and effect until after the Maturity Date, and Borrower hereby
         authorizes and appoints (and shall cause Operating Lessee to authorize
         and appoint) Lender their attorney-in-fact to exercise any such option
         in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower and/or Operating Lessee,
         which power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall be deemed to be
         coupled with an interest. Any sums expended by Lender pursuant to this
         paragraph (i) shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date
         such cost is incurred to the date of payment to Lender, (ii) shall be
         deemed to constitute a portion of the Debt, (iii) shall be secured by
         the lien of the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents and
         (iv) shall be immediately due and payable upon demand by Lender
         therefor.

                                      -86-
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Without limitation of the foregoing, Borrower shall
         cause Operating Lessee, upon the request of Lender and in accordance
         with the provisions of the applicable Assignment of Management
         Agreement, to terminate the Management Agreement and replace the
         Manager, without penalty or fee, if at any time during the Loan: (a)
         the Manager shall become insolvent or a debtor in any bankruptcy or
         insolvency proceeding, (b) there exists an Event of Default or (c)
         there exists an event of default by Manager under the Management
         Agreement. At all times, a Qualified Manager shall manage each Property
         pursuant to the Management Agreement or a Replacement Management
         Agreement, as applicable.

         5.1.19   Environmental Covenants.

                  (a)      Borrower covenants and agrees that so long as the
         Loan is outstanding (i) all uses and operations on or of the
         Properties, whether by Borrower or any other Person, shall be in
         compliance in all material respects with all Environmental Laws and
         permits issued pursuant thereto; (ii) there shall be no Releases of
         Hazardous Materials in, on, under or from any of the Properties; (iii)
         there shall be no Hazardous Materials in, on, or under any of the
         Properties, except those that are both (A) in compliance with all
         Environmental Laws and with permits issued pursuant thereto, if and to
         the extent required, and (B) (1) in amounts not in excess of that
         necessary to operate the applicable Property or (2) fully disclosed to
         and approved by Lender in writing; (iv) Borrower shall keep the
         Properties free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances imposed
         pursuant to any Environmental Law, whether due to any act or omission
         of Borrower or any other Person (the "Environmental Liens"); (v)
         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, fully and expeditiously
         cooperate in all activities pursuant to paragraph (b) below, including
         but not limited to providing all relevant information and making
         knowledgeable persons available for interviews; (vi) Borrower shall, at
         its sole cost and expense, perform any environmental site assessment or
         other investigation of environmental conditions in connection with any
         of the Properties, pursuant to any reasonable written request of
         Lender, upon Lender's reasonable belief that a Property is not in full
         compliance with all Environmental Laws, and share with Lender the
         reports and other results thereof, and Lender and other Indemnified
         Parties shall be entitled to rely on such reports and other results
         thereof; (vii) Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, comply
         with all reasonable written requests of Lender to (A) reasonably
         effectuate remediation of any Hazardous Materials in, on, under or from
         any Property; and (B) comply with any Environmental Law; (viii)
         Borrower shall not allow any tenant or other user of any of the
         Properties to violate any Environmental Law; and (ix) Borrower shall
         immediately notify Lender in writing after it has become aware of (A)
         any presence or Release or threatened Releases of Hazardous Materials
         in, on, under, from or migrating towards any of the Properties; (B) any
         non-compliance with any Environmental Laws related in any way to any of
         the Properties; (C) any actual or potential Environmental Lien; (D) any
         required or proposed remediation of environmental conditions relating
         to any of the Properties; and (E) any written or oral notice or other
         communication of which Borrower becomes aware from any source
         whatsoever (including but not limited to a Governmental Authority)
         relating in any way to Hazardous Materials in connection with the
         Properties.

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Lender and any other Person designated by Lender by
         written notice to Borrower, including but not limited to any
         representative of a Governmental Authority, and any environmental
         consultant, and any receiver appointed by any court of competent
         jurisdiction, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enter
         upon any Property at all reasonable times to assess any and all aspects
         of the environmental condition of any Property and its use, including
         but not limited to conducting any environmental assessment or audit
         (the scope of which shall be determined in Lender's sole and absolute
         discretion) and taking samples of soil, groundwater or other water,
         air, or building materials, and conducting other invasive testing.
         Borrower shall cooperate with and provide access to Lender and any such
         Person or entity designated by Lender by written notice to Borrower.

         5.1.20   Alterations.

         Borrower shall obtain Lender's prior written consent to (i) any
structural alteration or (ii) any other alteration to any Improvements which is
estimated to cost in excess of four percent (4%) of the Property Value of the
applicable Property, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld except
with respect to alterations that may have a material adverse effect on
Borrower's financial condition, the value of the related Property or the Net
Operating Income thereof.

         5.1.21   Franchise Agreement.

         The Improvements on the Properties shall be operated under the terms
and conditions of the Franchise Agreements, if applicable or a replacement
franchise agreement approved by Lender (unless such franchise agreement is
substantially in the same form and substance as the Franchise Agreements) with a
Franchisor approved by Lender. Borrower shall (or shall cause Operating Lessee
to) (i) pay all sums required to be paid by Operating Lessee under the Franchise
Agreement, (ii) diligently perform, observe and enforce all of the terms,
covenants and conditions of the Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating
Lessee to be performed, observed and enforced to the end that all things shall
be done which are necessary to keep unimpaired the rights of Borrower and/or
Operating Lessee under the Franchise Agreement, (iii) promptly notify Lender of
the giving of any notice to Operating Lessee of any default by Operating Lessee
in the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of
the Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed and
observed and deliver to Lender a true copy of each such notice, and (iv)
promptly deliver to Lender a copy of each financial statement, business plan,
Quality Assurance Report, capital expenditure plan, notice, report and estimate
received by it under the Franchise Agreement. Borrower shall not (and shall
cause Operating Lessee to not), without the prior consent of Lender, surrender
the Franchise Agreement or terminate or cancel the Franchise Agreement or
modify, change, supplement, alter or amend the Franchise Agreement, in any
material respect, either orally or in writing, and Borrower hereby assigns (and
Borrower shall cause Operating Lessee to assign) to Lender as further security
for the payment of the Debt and for the performance and observance of the terms,
covenants and conditions of this Agreement, all the rights, privileges and
prerogatives of Borrower and Operating Lessee to surrender the Franchise
Agreement or to terminate, cancel, modify, change, supplement, alter or amend
the Franchise Agreement in any material respect, and any such surrender of the
Franchise Agreement or termination,

                                      -88-
<PAGE>

cancellation, modification, change, supplement, alteration or amendment of the
Franchise Agreement in any material respect without the prior consent of Lender
shall be void and of no force and effect. If Operating Lessee shall default in
the performance or observance of any material term, covenant or condition of the
Franchise Agreement on the part of Operating Lessee to be performed or observed,
then, without limiting the generality of the other provisions of this Agreement,
and without waiving or releasing Borrower from any of its obligations hereunder,
Lender shall have the right, but shall be under no obligation, to pay any sums
and to perform any act or take any action as may be appropriate to cause all the
terms, covenants and conditions of the Franchise Agreement on the part of
Operating Lessee to be performed or observed to be promptly performed or
observed on behalf of Operating Lessee, to the end that the rights of Operating
Lessee in, to and under the Franchise Agreement shall be kept unimpaired and
free from default. Lender and any Person designated by Lender by written notice
to Borrower shall have, and are hereby granted, the right to enter upon the
Properties at any time and from time to time for the purpose of taking any such
action. If Franchisor shall deliver to Lender a copy of any notice sent to
Borrower and/or Operating Lessee of default under the Franchise Agreement, such
notice shall constitute full protection to Lender for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by Lender in good faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower
shall, from time to time, use its best efforts to obtain from Franchisor such
certificates of estoppel with respect to compliance by Operating Lessee with the
terms of the Franchise Agreement as may be requested by Lender. Borrower and/or
Operating Lessee shall exercise each individual option, if any, to extend or
renew the term of the Franchise Agreement to the extent required to continue it
in full force and effect until after the Maturity Date, and Borrower hereby
expressly authorizes and appoints (and Borrower shall cause Operating Lessee to
authorize and appoint) Lender as its attorney-in-fact to exercise any such
option in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower and/or Operating Lessee, which
power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall be deemed to be coupled with an
interest. Any sums expended by Lender pursuant to this paragraph shall bear
interest at the Default Rate from the date such cost is incurred to the date of
payment to Lender, shall be deemed to constitute a portion of the Debt, shall be
secured by the lien of the Security Instruments and the other Loan Documents and
shall be immediately due and payable upon demand by Lender therefor.

         5.1.22   Operating Lease.

         Borrower shall:

                  (a)      promptly perform and/or observe all of the covenants
         and agreements required to be performed and observed by it under the
         Operating Lease and do all things necessary to preserve and to keep
         unimpaired its rights thereunder;

                  (b)      promptly notify Lender of any event of default under
         the Operating Lease;

                  (c)      promptly enforce the performance and observance of
         all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed and/or

         At all times throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower, Guarantor,
Indemnitor and their respective Affiliates shall be in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable orders, rules, regulations and
recommendations of The Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department
of the Treasury.

         5.1.24   The Ground Lease.

                  (a)      With respect to each Ground Lease, (a) Borrower shall
         (i) pay all rents, additional rents and other sums required to be paid
         by Borrower, as tenant under and pursuant to the provisions of each
         Ground Lease, (ii) diligently perform and observe all of the terms,
         covenants and conditions of each Ground Lease on the part of Borrower,
         as tenant thereunder, (iii) promptly notify Lender of the giving of any
         notice by the landlord under the applicable Ground Lease to Borrower of
         any default by Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and deliver to Lender a
         true copy of each such notice within five (5) Business Days of receipt
         and (iv) promptly notify Lender of any bankruptcy, reorganization or
         insolvency of the landlord under the applicable Ground Lease or of any
         notice thereof, and deliver to Lender a true copy of such notice within
         five (5) Business Days of Borrower's receipt. Borrower shall not,
         without the prior consent of Lender, surrender the leasehold estate
         created by the applicable Ground Lease or terminate or cancel any
         Ground Lease or modify, change, supplement, alter or amend any Ground
         Lease, either orally or in writing, and if Borrower shall default in
         the performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition of any
         Ground Lease on the part of Borrower, as tenant thereunder, and shall
         fail to cure the same prior to the expiration of any applicable cure
         period provided thereunder, Lender shall have the right, but shall be
         under no obligation, to pay any sums and to perform any act or take any
         action as may be appropriate to cause all of the terms, covenants and
         conditions of such Ground Lease on the part of Borrower to be performed
         or observed on behalf of Borrower, to the end that the rights of
         Borrower in, to and under such Ground Lease shall be kept unimpaired
         and free from default. If the landlord under the applicable Ground
         Lease shall deliver to Lender a copy of any notice of default under
         such Ground Lease, such notice shall constitute full protection to
         Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by Lender, in good
         faith, in reliance thereon. Borrower shall exercise each individual
         option, if any, to extend or renew the term of each Ground Lease upon
         demand by Lender made at any time within one (1) year prior to the last
         day upon which any such option may be exercised, and Borrower hereby
         expressly authorizes and appoints Lender its attorney-in-fact to
         exercise any such option in the name of and upon behalf of Borrower,
         which power of attorney shall be irrevocable and shall be deemed to be
         coupled with an interest.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything contained in any Ground
         Lease to the contrary, Borrower shall not further sublet any portion of
         the related Individual Property (other than as permitted pursuant to
         Section 5.1.17 hereof) without prior written consent of Lender. Each
         sublease hereafter made shall provide that, (a) in the event of the
         termination of the Ground Lease, the sublease shall not terminate or be
         terminable by the lessee thereunder; (b) in the event of any action for
         the foreclosure of the Security Instrument with respect to

                                      -90-
<PAGE>

         the related Individual Property, the sublease shall not terminate or be
         terminable by the lessee thereunder by reason of the termination of the
         Ground Lease unless such lessee is specifically named and joined in any
         such action and unless a judgment is obtained therein against such
         lessee; and (c) in the event that the Ground Lease is terminated as
         aforesaid, the lessee under the sublease shall attorn to the lessor
         under the Ground Lease or to the purchaser at the sale of the related
         Individual Property on such foreclosure, as the case may be. In the
         event that any portion of such Individual Property shall be sublet
         pursuant to the terms of this subsection, such sublease shall be deemed
         to be included in the Individual Property

         SECTION 5.2 NEGATIVE COVENANTS.

         From the date hereof until payment and performance in full of all
obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or the earlier release of the
Liens of all Security Instruments encumbering the Properties in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower covenants and
agrees with Lender that it will not do, directly or indirectly, any of the
following:

         5.2.1    Liens.

         combination of transactions, the assets or all or substantially all of
         the properties or assets of Borrower except to the extent expressly
         permitted by the Loan Documents, (iii) except as expressly permitted
         under the Loan Documents, modify, amend, waive or terminate its
         organizational documents or its qualification and good standing in any

         liquidate or take any action, or omit to take an action, as a result of
         which Principal would be dissolved, wound up or liquidated in whole or
         in part, or (B) except as expressly permitted under the Loan Documents,
         amend, modify, waive or terminate the certificate of incorporation,
         bylaws or similar organizational documents of Principal, in each case,

         (with respect to (iv)(B) only) shall not be unreasonably withheld or
         delayed.

                  (b)      Borrower shall not permit Operating Lessee to (i)
         engage in any dissolution, liquidation or consolidation or merger with
         or into any other business entity, (ii) transfer, lease or sell, in one
         transaction or any combination of transactions, the assets or all or
         substantially all of the properties or assets of Operating Lessee
         except to the extent expressly permitted by the Loan Documents, (iii)
         except as expressly permitted under the Loan Documents, modify, amend,
         waive or terminate its organizational documents or its qualification
         and good standing in any jurisdiction or (iv) cause the

                                      -91-
<PAGE>

         Operating Lessee Principal to (A) dissolve, wind up or liquidate or
         take any action, or omit to take an action, as a result of which
         Operating Lessee Principal would be dissolved, wound up or liquidated
         in whole or in part, or (B) except as expressly permitted under the
         Loan Documents, amend, modify, waive or terminate the certificate of
         incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of Operating
         Lessee Principal, in each case, without obtaining the prior written
         consent of Lender, which consent (with respect to (iv)(B) only) shall
         not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         5.2.3    Change In Business.

         Borrower shall not enter into any line of business other than the

operations or undertake or participate in activities other than the continuance
of its present business.

         5.2.4    Debt Cancellation.

         Borrower shall not cancel or otherwise forgive or release any material
claim or debt (other than termination of Leases in accordance herewith) owed to
Borrower by any Person, except for adequate consideration and in the ordinary

         5.2.5    Zoning.

         Borrower shall not initiate or consent to any zoning reclassification

ordinance or any other Applicable Law, without the prior written consent of
Lender.

         5.2.6    No Joint Assessment.

         Borrower shall not suffer, permit or initiate the joint assessment of
any Property with (a) any other real property constituting a tax lot separate
from such Property, or (b) any portion of such Property which may be deemed to

levied or charged to such Property.

         5.2.7    Name, Identity, Structure, or Principal Place of Business.

         Borrower shall not change its name, identity (including its trade name
or names), or principal place of business set forth in the introductory
paragraph of this Agreement, without, in each case, first giving Lender thirty
(30) days prior written notice. Borrower shall not change its corporate,
partnership or other structure, or the place of its organization as set forth in

security agreements and other instruments

                                      -92-

interest in the Collateral as a result of such change of principal place of
business or place of organization.

         Borrower shall constitute Plan Assets.

                  (b)      Borrower further covenants and agrees to deliver to
         Lender such certifications or other evidence from time to time
         throughout the term of the Loan, as requested by Lender in its sole
         discretion, and represents and covenants that (A) Borrower is not and
         does not maintain an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section

an Affiliate of Borrower, Principal, the Operating Lessee SPE Entities or any of
the partners of Borrower, Principal or the Operating Lessee SPE Entities except
in the ordinary course of business and on terms which are fully disclosed to
Lender in advance and are no less favorable to Borrower or such Affiliate than
would be obtained in a comparable arm's-length transaction with an unrelated
third party.

         5.2.10   Transfers.

                  (a)      Neither Borrower nor Operating Lessee shall sell,

         such partnership interest, or the Sale or Pledge of limited partnership
         interests or any profits or proceeds relating to such limited
         partnership interests or the creation or issuance of new limited
         partnership interests; (v) if a Restricted Party is a limited liability
         company, any merger or consolidation or the change, removal,
         resignation or addition of a managing member or non-member manager (or
         if no managing member, any member) or the Sale or Pledge of the
         membership interest of a managing member (or if no managing member, any
         member) or any profits or proceeds relating to such membership
         interest, or the Sale or Pledge of non-managing membership interests or
         the creation or issuance of new non-managing membership interests; or
         (vi) if a Restricted Party is a trust or nominee trust, any merger,
         consolidation or the Sale or Pledge of the legal or beneficial interest
         in a Restricted Party or the creation or issuance of new legal or

                  (c)      Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 5.2.10(a)
         and (b), the following transfers shall not be deemed to be a Transfer:
         (i) a transfer by devise or descent or by operation of law upon the
         death of a member, partner or shareholder of a Restricted Party or a
         Restricted Party itself; (ii) the Sale or Pledge, in one or a series of
         transactions, of not more than forty nine percent (49%) of the stock in
         a Restricted Party; provided, however, no such transfers shall result
         in the change of voting control in the Restricted Party, and as a
         condition to each such transfer, Lender shall receive not less than
         thirty (30) days prior written notice of such proposed transfer and
         (iii) the Sale or Pledge, in one or a series of transactions, of not
         more than forty nine percent (49%) of the limited partnership interests
         or non managing membership interests (as the case may be) in a
         Restricted Party; provided, however, as a condition to each such
         transfer, Lender shall receive not less than thirty (30) days prior
         written notice of such proposed transfer.

                  (d)      Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any
         actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of default
         hereunder in order to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon
         a Transfer in violation of this Section 5.2.2. This provision shall
         apply to every Transfer regardless of whether voluntary or not, or
         whether or not Lender has consented to any previous Transfer.
         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
         5.2.10, (a) no transfer (whether or not such transfer shall constitute
         a Transfer) shall be made to any Prohibited Person and (b) in the event

                                      -94-
<PAGE>

         any transfer (whether or not such transfer shall constitute a Transfer)
         results in any Person owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of
         the ownership interest in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to
         such transfer, deliver an updated Insolvency Opinion to Lender, which
         opinion shall be in form, scope and substance acceptable in all
         respects to Lender.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         this Section 5.2.10, Lender's consent shall not be required for the
         financing or leasing of personal property, including, without
         limitation, furniture, fixtures and equipment owned or to be purchased
         by Borrower that is used in connection with the operation of the
         Property ("Equipment"), provided Lender has received prior written
         notification of Borrower's intent to finance such Equipment, and
         provided, further, that (i) any such financing or leasing is subject to
         commercially prudent terms and conditions and at a market rate of
         interest, (ii) the Equipment financed or leased is readily replaceable
         without material interference or interruption to the operation of any
         Property, and (iii) the aggregate principal amount of such financing
         and leasing for Equipment located on or used in connection with each
         Property is at all times less than $250,000 ("Permitted FF&E
         Financing") and (iv) the financing does not create a Lien on any
         Property other than on the Equipment financed or leased thereunder.

                  (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         this Section 5.2.10, a transfer of direct or indirect limited
         partnership interests and/or non-managing membership interests in a
         Restricted Party shall be permitted provided that (i) FelCor Lodging
         Limited Partnership shall, at all times, own, directly or indirectly,
         at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the equity interests in, and
         Control, all Restricted Parties and (ii) FelCor Lodging Trust
         Incorporated must at all times be the sole general partner of FelCor
         Lodging Limited Partnership.

         SECTION 5.3 RECALCULATION OF AVAILABLE FACILITY AMOUNT.

                  Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Available Facility
Amount shall be recalculated (and increased or decreased as applicable): (a)
upon the date of each Advance hereunder, (b) each calendar month promptly
following Lender's receipt of the operating statements required pursuant to
Section 5.1.10 hereof based upon the calculation by Lender of the Portfolio Debt
Service Coverage Ratio and the Portfolio Loan To Value Ratio, (c) after giving
effect to any release and substitution in accordance with Section 2.5 hereof,
(d) after receipt of new or updated Appraisals pursuant to Section 5.4 hereof
and (e) upon a Conversion or a Floating Rate CMBS Conversion.

         SECTION 5.4 UPDATED APPRAISALS.

                  (a)      Upon the occurrence of an Appraisal Update Event,
         Lender shall order, at Borrower's sole cost and expense, Appraisals for
         (i) in the event that Lender reasonably determines that the Appraisal
         Update Event is specific to one or more particular Property or
         Properties, such Property or Properties or (ii) in the event that
         Lender determines that the Appraisal Update Event is general in nature,
         all of the Properties. Notwithstanding the

                                      -95-
<PAGE>

         foregoing sentence, in the event that the Appraisal Update Event was
         the result of a Material Adverse Hotel Market and the new or updated
         Appraisals indicate an aggregate Property Value of all of the
         Properties of equal to or greater than the aggregate Property Value of
         all of the Properties on the Closing Date (as the same may be adjusted
         for any substitutions and releases pursuant to Section 2.5 and the
         addition of New Properties pursuant to Section 2.7), then Borrower
         shall only be obligated to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
         obtaining such new or updated Appraisals.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.4(a) to
         the contrary, Borrower may request Lender to obtain (and Lender shall
         promptly order) new Appraisals for one or more Properties; provided,
         (i) Borrower shall be obligated to pay all costs and expenses in
         connection with such Appraisals and (ii) Borrower may not request
         Lender to obtain such Appraisals more than one (1) time with respect to
         each Property in any consecutive twelve (12) month period.

                  VI.      INSURANCE; CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION

         SECTION 6.1 INSURANCE.

                  (a)      Borrower shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be
         maintained, Policies for Borrower and the Properties providing at least
         the following coverages:

                       (i)      so called "All Risk" or Special Form insurance
              on the Improvements and the Personal Property, in each case (ii)
              in an amount equal to 100% of the "Full Replacement Cost," which
              for purposes of this Agreement shall mean actual replacement value
              (exclusive of costs of excavations, foundations, underground
              utilities and footings) with a waiver of depreciation, (iii)
              containing an agreed amount endorsement or its equivalent with
              respect to the Improvements, business income, rent loss and
              Personal Property waiving all co-insurance provisions; (iv)
              providing for no deductible in excess of $100,000; and (v)
              providing coverage for contingent liability from Operation of
              Building Laws, Demolition Costs and Increased Cost of Construction
              Endorsements together with an "Ordinance or Law Coverage" or
              "Enforcement" endorsement if any of the Improvements or the use of
              each Property shall at any time constitute legal non-conforming
              structures or uses. The Full Replacement Cost shall be
              redetermined from time to time (but not more frequently than once
              in any twenty-four (24) calendar months) at the request of Lender
              by an appraiser or contractor designated and paid by Borrower and
              approved by Lender, or by an engineer or appraiser in the regular
              employ of the insurer. After the first appraisal, additional
              appraisals may be based on construction cost indices customarily
              employed in the trade. No omission on the part of Lender to
              request any such ascertainment shall relieve Borrower of any of
              its obligations under this Subsection;

                       (ii)     commercial general liability insurance against
              claims for personal injury, bodily injury, death or property

              Shop" or other liquor liability coverage if alcoholic beverages
              are sold from or may be consumed at the Property such insurance
              (A) to be on the so-called

              "occurrence" form with a combined single limit of not less than
              $5,000,000.00; (B) to continue at not less than the aforesaid
              limit until required to be changed by Lender in writing by reason
              of changed economic conditions making such protection inadequate;
              and (C) to cover at least the following hazards: (1) premises and
              operations; (2) products and completed operations on an "if any"
              basis; (3) independent contractors; (4) blanket contractual
              liability for all written and oral contracts; and (5) contractual
              liability covering the indemnities contained in Article 10 of the
              Security Instruments to the extent the same is available;

                       (iii)    business interruption/loss of rents insurance

              each Property (on an actual loss sustained basis) for a period
              continuing until the Restoration of the Property is completed; the
              amount of such business interruption/loss of rents insurance shall
              be determined prior to the Closing Date and at least once each
              year thereafter based on the greatest of: (x) Borrower's
              reasonable estimate of the gross income from each Property and (y)
              the highest gross income received during the term of the Note for
              any full calendar year prior to the date the amount of such
              insurance is being determined, in each case for the succeeding
              twenty-four (24) month period and (D) containing an extended
              period of indemnity endorsement which provides that after the
              physical loss to the Improvements and the Personal Property has
              been repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until
              such income either returns to the same level it was at prior to
              the loss, or the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date
              that the applicable Property is repaired or replaced and
              operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and
              notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of
              such period; All insurance proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to
              this Section 6.1(a)(iii) shall be held by Lender and shall be
              applied to the obligations secured hereunder from time to time due
              and payable hereunder and under the Note and this Agreement;
              provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be deemed
              to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations
              secured hereunder on the respective dates of payment provided for
              in the Note and this Agreement except to the extent such amounts
              are actually paid out of the proceeds of such business
              interruption/loss of rents insurance.

                       (iv)     at all times during which structural
              construction, repairs or alterations are being made with respect
              to the Improvements (A) owner's contingent or protective liability
              insurance covering claims not covered by or under the terms or
              provisions of the insurance provided for in Section 6.1(c)(ii);
              and (B) the insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a)(i) shall be
              written in a so-called builder's risk completed value form (1) on
              a non-reporting basis, (2) against all risks insured against
              pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i), (3) shall include permission to
              occupy each Property, and (4) shall contain an agreed amount
              endorsement waiving co-insurance provisions; provided, however,
              the insurance required pursuant to this Section 6.1(a)(iv) may be
              obtained by the Manager for the benefit of Borrower and the
              applicable Property.

                       (v)      workers' compensation, subject to the statutory
              limits of the State in which each Property is located, and
              employer's liability insurance with a limit of at least

                                      -97-

              $1,000,000.00 for disease aggregate in respect of any work or
              operations on or about each Property, or in connection with such
              Property or its operation (if applicable);

              property insurance policy required under Section 6.1(b)(i);

                       (vii)    if any portion of the Improvements is at any
              time located in an area identified by the Secretary of Housing and
              Urban Development or any successor thereto as an area having
              special flood hazards pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act
              of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 or the National
              Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each may be amended, or any
              successor law (the "Flood Insurance Acts"), flood hazard insurance
              of the following types and in the following amounts (A) coverage
              under Policies issued pursuant to the Flood Insurance Acts (the
              "Flood Insurance Policies") in an amount equal to the maximum
              limit of coverage available for the applicable Property under the
              Flood Insurance Acts, subject only to customary deductibles under
              such Policies and (B) coverage under supplemental private Policies
              in an amount, which when added to the coverage provided under the
              Flood Act Policies with respect to a Property, is not less than
              the applicable CMBS Loan Amount for such Property;

                       (viii)   (A) if required by Lender for each Property
              (other than the Mandalay Beach Property), earthquake, sinkhole and
              mine subsidence insurance in amounts as determined by Lender in
              its sole discretion and in form and substance satisfactory to
              Lender, provided that the insurance pursuant to this Section
              6.1(a)(viii) hereof shall be on terms consistent with the all risk
              insurance policy required under Section 6.1(a)(i) hereof and (B)
              for the Mandalay Beach Property, earthquake insurance equal to the
              Required Earthquake Insurance Amount and if required by Lender,

              Lender in its sole discretion and in form and substance
              satisfactory to Lender, provided that the insurance pursuant to
              this Section 6.1(a)(viii) hereof shall be on terms consistent with
              the all risk insurance policy required under Section 6.1(a)(i)
              hereof;

                       (ix)     umbrella liability insurance in an amount not
              less than Two Hundred Million and No/100 Dollars ($200,000,000.00)
              per occurrence on terms consistent with the commercial general
              liability insurance policy required under Section 6.1(b)(v)
              hereof;

                       (x)      insurance against terrorism, terrorist acts or
              similar acts of sabotage ("Terrorism Insurance") pursuant to, at
              Borrower's option, a (A) blanket insurance policy with aggregate
              limits of not less than $50,000,000.00 or (B) a stand-alone
              insurance policy covering only the Properties with coverage of not
              less than $50,000,000.00, and, in either case with a deductible of
              not more than $250,000.00 (the "Terrorism Insurance Required
              Amount"). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event
              Borrower has obtained a stand-alone insurance policy pursuant to
              subsection (B) above, Borrower shall

                                      -98-
<PAGE>

              not be obligated to expend more than $400,000.00 in any fiscal
              year on Insurance Premiums for Terrorism Insurance (the "Terrorism
              Insurance Cap") and if the cost of the Terrorism Insurance
              Required Amount exceeds the Terrorism Insurance Cap, Borrower
              shall purchase the maximum amount of Terrorism Insurance available
              with funds equal to the Terrorism Insurance Cap; provided,
              however, in the event it is customary among owners of Class A
              hotel properties in the United States to have "All Risk" coverage
              without any exclusion (a "Terrorism Exclusion") from coverage
              under such Policy for loss or damage incurred as a result of an
              act of terrorism, terrorist acts or similar acts of sabotage,
              Borrower shall (provided the same does not add any material cost
              to Borrower's Insurance Premiums) obtain a Policy without any such
              Terrorism Exclusion. After the occurrence of any event which
              reduces the amount of insurance available under the Terrorism
              Insurance required hereunder (whether due to a claim or
              otherwise), Borrower shall be obligated to immediately increase
              the coverage of such Terrorism Insurance so that at least
              $50,000,000.00 of coverage is available thereunder at all times.

                       (xi)     a blanket fidelity bond and errors and omissions
              insurance coverage insuring against losses resulting from
              dishonest or fraudulent acts committed by (A) Borrower's
              personnel; (B) any employees of outside firms that provide
              appraisal, legal, data processing or other services for Borrower
              or (C) temporary contract employees or student interns; provided,
              however, the insurance required pursuant to this Section
              6.1(a)(xi) may be obtained by the Manager for the benefit of
              Borrower and the applicable Property and

                       (xii)    such other insurance and in such amounts as are
              required pursuant to the Franchise Agreement or as Lender from
              time to time may reasonably request against such other insurable
              hazards which at the time are commonly insured against for
              property similar to each Property located in or around the region
              in which the each Property is located.

                  (b)      All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof
         shall be obtained under valid and enforceable policies (the "Policies"
         or in the singular, the "Policy"), in such forms and, from time to time
         after the date hereof, in such amounts as may be satisfactory to
         Lender, issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies
         authorized to do business in the State in which each Property is
         located and approved by Lender. The initial $30,000,000 of insurance
         required pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i), (iii) and (vi) hereof (the
         "Initial Tier") may be with (1) one or more primary insurers having (or
         a syndicate of insurers through which at least 75% of the coverage (if
         there are 4 or fewer members of the syndicate) or at least 60% of the
         coverage (if there are 5 or more members of the syndicate) is with
         carriers having), a claims paying ability rating by S&P not lower than
         "AA-" and an A.M. Best rating of at least "A:IX" (a "Initial Tier
         Insurer") and (2) the balance of the coverage is with one or more
         carriers having a claims paying ability rating by S&P not lower than
         "BBB-" and an A.M. Best rating of at least "A:IX"; provided, however,
         Endurance Specialty Insurance, Ltd. shall be deemed a Initial Tier
         Insurer so long as it (x) maintains an A.M. Best rating of at least
         "A-:IX" and (y) does not provide in excess of $2,000,000 of the
         insurance coverage required pursuant to the Initial Tier. The remaining
         portions of the insurance required pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i), (iii)

                                      -99-
<PAGE>

         and (vi) hereof (the "Second Tier") may be with (1) one or more primary
         insurers having (or a syndicate of insurers through which at least 75%
         of the coverage (if there are 4 or fewer members of the syndicate) or
         at least 60% of the coverage (if there are 5 or more members of the
         syndicate) is with carriers having), a claims paying ability rating by
         S&P not lower than "A" and an A.M. Best rating of at least "A-:IX" (a
         "Second Tier Insurer") and (2) the balance of the coverage is with one
         or more carriers having a claims paying ability rating by S&P not lower
         than "BBB-" and an A.M. Best rating of at least "A-:IX"; provided,
         however, Allied World Assurance Co. shall be deemed a Second Tier
         Insurer so long as it (x) maintains an A.M. Best rating of at least
         "A-:IX" and (y) does not provide in excess of $4,500,000 of the
         insurance coverage required pursuant to the Second Tier. All other
         insurance companies must have a claims paying ability/financial
         strength rating of "A" (or its equivalent) or better by all of the
         Rating Agencies and have an A.M. Best rating of "A:IX" or greater (each
         such insurer shall be referred to below as a "Qualified Insurer"). Not
         less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration dates of the
         Policies theretofore furnished to Lender pursuant to Section 6.1(a),
         Borrower shall deliver certified copies of the Policies marked "premium
         paid" or accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of payment of
         the premiums due thereunder (the "Insurance Premiums"). In the event
         Borrower desires to obtain the insurance required hereunder from an
         insurer not meeting the requirements of this Section 6.1(b), Borrower
         may request, in writing, Lender's approval of such insurer, which
         approval may be given or withheld in Lender's sole discretion.

                  (c)      Borrower shall not obtain (i) any umbrella or blanket
         liability or casualty Policy unless, in each case, such Policy is at
         least equal in scope of coverage as if a "stand-alone" Policy meeting
         all of the requirement noted above is provided as such Policy is
         approved in advance in writing by Lender and Lender's interest is
         included therein as provided in this Agreement and such Policy is
         issued by a Qualified Insurer, or (ii) separate insurance concurrent in
         form or contributing in the event of loss with that required in Section
         6.1(a) to be furnished by, or which may be reasonably required to be
         furnished by, Borrower. In the event Borrower obtains separate
         insurance or an umbrella or a blanket policy, Borrower shall notify
         Lender of the same and shall cause certified copies of each Policy to
         be delivered as required in Section 6.1(a). Any blanket insurance
         Policy shall specifically allocate to the Property the amount of
         coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall otherwise
         provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only
         the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(a).
         Notwithstanding Lender's approval of any umbrella or blanket liability
         or casualty Policy hereunder, Lender reserves the right, in its sole
         discretion, to require Borrower to obtain a separate Policy in
         compliance with this Section 6.1.

                  (d)      All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section
         6.1(a)hereof, except for the Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(v),
         shall name Lender and Borrower as the insured or additional insured, as
         their respective interests may appear, and in the case of property
         damage, boiler and machinery, and flood insurance, shall contain a
         so-called New York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor
         of Lender providing that the loss thereunder shall be payable to
         Lender.

                  (e)      All Policies provided for in Section 6.1(a) hereof
         shall contain clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

                  (i)      no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting
         for Borrower, or failure to comply with the provisions of any Policy
         which might otherwise result in a forfeiture of the insurance or any
         part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or enforceability of
         the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned;

                  (ii)     the Policy shall not be materially changed (other
         than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or cancelled without at
         least 30 days' written notice to Lender and any other party named
         therein as an insured;

                  (iii)    each Policy shall provide that the issuers thereof
         shall give written notice to Lender if the Policy has not been renewed
         thirty (30) days prior to its expiration; and

                  (iv)     Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
         thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

                  (f)      Borrower shall furnish to Lender, on or before thirty
         (30) days after the close of each of Borrower's fiscal years, a
         statement certified by Borrower or a duly authorized officer of
         Borrower of the amounts of insurance maintained in compliance herewith,
         of the risks covered by such insurance and of the insurance company or
         companies which carry such insurance and, if requested by Lender,
         verification of the adequacy of such insurance by an independent
         insurance broker or appraiser acceptable to Lender.

                  (g)      If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written
         evidence that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and
         effect, Lender shall have the right, with prior notice to Borrower, to
         take such action as Lender deems necessary to protect its interest in
         the Properties, including, without limitation, the obtaining of such
         insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion deems appropriate,
         and all expenses incurred by Lender in connection with such action or
         in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
         Borrower to Lender upon demand and until paid shall be secured by the
         Security Instruments and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

                  (h)      In the event of a foreclosure of any of the Security
         Instruments, or other transfer of title to any Property in
         extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all right, title and
         interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force and all
         proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at
         such foreclosure or Lender or other transferee in the event of such
         other transfer of title.

         SECTION 6.2 CASUALTY.

         If a Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part, by
fire or other casualty (a "Casualty"), Borrower shall give prompt notice of such
damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the
completion of the Restoration of the Property as nearly as possible to the
condition the Property was in immediately prior to such Casualty, with such

                                     -101-
<PAGE>

alterations as may be reasonably approved by Lender and otherwise in accordance
with Section 6.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or
not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated
to make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.

         SECTION 6.3 CONDEMNATION.

         Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of all or any part of any
Property and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers served in
connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including, but not
limited to, any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If any Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall, promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of
the applicable Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6.4.
If any Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt
by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency
judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the
Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

         SECTION 6.4 RESTORATION.

         The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration
of any Property:

                  (a)      If the Net Proceeds shall be less than Two Hundred
         Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) and the costs of
         completing the Restoration shall be less than Two Hundred Fifty
         Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00), the Net Proceeds will be
         disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the
         conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers
         to Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to
         satisfactorily complete with due diligence the Restoration in
         accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (b)      If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than Two

         completing the Restoration is equal to or greater than Two Hundred
         Fifty Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) Lender shall make the
         Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 6.4. The term "Net Proceeds" shall mean: (i)
         the net amount of

         all insurance proceeds received by Lender pursuant to Section
         6.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi), (vii) and (viii) as a result of such damage or
         destruction, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
         (including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in
         collecting same ("Insurance Proceeds"), or (ii) the net amount of the
         Award, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses (including,
         but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
         same ("Condemnation Proceeds"), whichever the case may be.

                  (i)      The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower
         for Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                           (A)      no Default or Event of Default (unless
                  caused solely by the Condemnation or Casualty) shall have
                  occurred and be continuing;

                           (B)      (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                  Insurance Proceeds, less than thirty percent (30%) of the
                  total floor area of the Improvements on the Property has been
                  damaged, destroyed or rendered unusable as a result of such
                  Casualty or (2) in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation
                  Proceeds, less than ten percent (10%) of the land constituting
                  the Property is taken, and such land is located along the
                  perimeter or periphery of the Property, and no portion of the
                  Improvements is located on such land;

                           (C)      The Operating Lease shall remain in full
                  force and effect during and after the completion of the
                  Restoration;

                           (D)      Borrower shall commence the Restoration as
                  soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
                  thirty (30) days after such Casualty or Condemnation,
                  whichever the case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue
                  the same to satisfactory completion in compliance with all
                  Legal Requirements, including, without limitation, all
                  applicable Environmental Laws and in accordance with the terms
                  and conditions of the Franchise Agreement;

                           (E)      Lender shall be satisfied that any operating
                  deficits, including all scheduled payments of principal and
                  interest under the Note, which will be incurred with respect
                  to the Property as a result of the occurrence of any such
                  Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be
                  covered out of (1) the Net Proceeds, (2) the insurance
                  coverage referred to in Section 6.1(a)(iii), if applicable, or
                  (3) by other funds of Borrower;

                           (F)      Lender shall be satisfied that the
                  Restoration will be completed on or before the earliest to
                  occur of (1) six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date, (2)
                  six (6) months after the occurrence of such Casualty or
                  Condemnation, or (3) the earliest date required for such
                  completion under the terms of any Leases which are required in
                  accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b) to
                  remain in effect subsequent to the occurrence of such Casualty
                  or Condemnation and the completion of the Restoration, or (4)
                  the date required for such completion pursuant to the
                  Franchise Agreement, (5) such time as may be required under

                                     -103-
<PAGE>

                  Applicable Law, in order to repair and restore the applicable
                  Property to the condition it was in immediately prior to such
                  Casualty or Condemnation or (6) the expiration of the
                  insurance coverage referred to in Section 6.1(a)(iii);

                           (G)      the Property and the use thereof after the
                  Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
                  Legal Requirements;

                           (H)      Lender shall be satisfied that the Debt
                  Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) month period
                  immediately succeeding the completion of the Restoration shall
                  be equal to or greater than 1.30 to 1;

                           (I)      such Casualty or Condemnation, as
                  applicable, does not result in the loss of access in any
                  material respect to the Property or the related Improvements;

                           (J)      Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be
                  delivered, to Lender a signed detailed budget approved in
                  writing by Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire
                  cost of completing the Restoration, which budget shall be
                  acceptable to Lender;

                           (K)      the Net Proceeds together with any Cash or
                  Cash equivalent deposited by Borrower with Lender are
                  sufficient in Lender's discretion to cover the cost of the
                  Restoration;

                           (L)      the Management Agreement in effect as of the
                  date of the occurrence of such Casualty or Condemnation,
                  whichever the case may be, shall (1) remain in full force and
                  effect during the Restoration and shall not otherwise
                  terminate as a result of the Casualty or Condemnation or the
                  Restoration or (2) if terminated, shall have been replaced
                  with a Replacement Management Agreement with a Qualified
                  Manager, prior to the opening or reopening of the applicable
                  Property or any portion thereof for business with the public;
                  and

                           (M)      the Franchise Agreement is not terminated as
                  a result of such Casualty or Condemnation.

                  (ii)     The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender in an
         interest-bearing account and, until disbursed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 6.4(b), shall constitute additional security
         for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net
         Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower
         from time to time during the course of the Restoration, upon receipt of
         evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A) all materials installed and
         work and labor performed (except to the extent that they are to be paid
         for out of the requested disbursement) in connection with the
         Restoration have been paid for in full, and (B) there exist no notices
         of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices
         of intention to file same, or any other Liens or encumbrances of any
         nature whatsoever on the Property which have not either been fully
         bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and

                                     -104-
<PAGE>

         discharged of record or in the alternative fully insured to the
         satisfaction of Lender by the title company issuing the Title Insurance
         Policy.

                  (iii)    All plans and specifications required in connection
         with the Restoration, the cost of which is greater than $250,000.00,
         shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in all respects by
         Lender and by an independent consulting engineer selected by Lender
         (the "Casualty Consultant"). Lender shall have the use of the plans and
         specifications and all permits, licenses and approvals required or
         obtained in connection with the Restoration. The identity of the
         contractors, subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration
         the cost of which is greater than $250,000.00, as well as the contracts
         under which they have been engaged, shall be subject to prior review
         and acceptance by Lender and the Casualty Consultant. All costs and
         expenses incurred by Lender in connection with making the Net Proceeds
         available for the Restoration including, without limitation, reasonable
         counsel fees and disbursements and the Casualty Consultant's fees,
         shall be paid by Borrower.

                  (iv)     In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
         disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the
         costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of
         the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, minus the
         Casualty Retainage. The term "Casualty Retainage" shall mean an amount
         equal to ten percent (10%), of the costs actually incurred for work in
         place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the Casualty
         Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The Casualty
         Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything to the
         contrary set forth above in this Section 6.4(b), be less than the
         amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors, subcontractors
         and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The Casualty Retainage
         shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender
         that the Restoration has been completed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for
         the re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all
         appropriate Governmental Authorities, and Lender receives evidence
         satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid
         in full or will be paid in full out of the Casualty Retainage;
         provided, however, that Lender will release the portion of the Casualty
         Retainage being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or
         materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date upon which the
         Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed all work and
         has supplied all materials in accordance with the provisions of the
         contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's contract, the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and
         evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender
         or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy for the
         related Property, and Lender receives an endorsement to such Title
         Insurance Policy insuring the continued priority of the Lien of the
         related Security Instrument and evidence of payment of any premium
         payable for such endorsement. If required by Lender, the release of any
         such portion of the Casualty Retainage shall be approved by the surety
         company, if any, which has issued a payment or performance bond with
         respect to the contractor, subcontractor or materialman.

                                     -105-
<PAGE>

                  (v)      Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
         of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (vi)     If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed
         balance thereof shall not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation
         with the Casualty Consultant, if any, be sufficient to pay in full the
         balance of the costs which are estimated by the Casualty Consultant to
         be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration,
         Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency")
         with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall
         be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be
         held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in
         connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to
         the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant
         to this Section 6.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the
         Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (vii)    The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the
         remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited
         with Lender after the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that the
         Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of
         this Section 6.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory
         to Lender that all costs incurred in connection with the Restoration
         have been paid in full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower,
         provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be
         continuing under the Note, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
         Documents.

                  (c)      All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made
         available for the Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as
         excess Net Proceeds pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(vii) may be retained and
         applied by Lender toward the payment of the Debt whether or not then
         due and payable in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in
         its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, at the discretion of Lender,
         the same may be paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such
         purposes as Lender shall approve, in its discretion. If Lender shall
         receive and retain Net Proceeds, the Lien of the Security Instruments
         shall be reduced only by the amount thereof received and retained by
         Lender and actually applied by Lender in reduction of the Debt.

                           VII.     RESERVE FUNDS

         SECTION 7.1 REQUIRED REPAIR FUNDS.

         7.1.1    Deposits.

         With respect to the Reserve Properties only (unless Lender has agreed
to waive such requirement with respect to one or more such Reserve Properties),
on the Closing Date, Borrower shall deposit into an escrow account with Lender
(the "Required Repair Account") one-hundred twenty five percent (125%) of such
amount as reasonably determined by Lender to be necessary to perform the
Required Repairs for such Property. Amounts so deposited with Lender shall be
held by Lender in accordance with Section 7.7 hereof. Amounts so deposited

                                     -106-
<PAGE>

shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "Required Repair Fund." Borrower
shall perform the repairs at all of the Properties, including, without
limitation, the Reserve Properties, as more particularly set forth on EXHIBIT Z
hereto (such repairs hereinafter referred to as "Required Repairs"). Borrower
shall provide evidence to Lender that all Required Repairs have been completed
in a good and workmanlike manner and in accordance with all Legal Requirements
on or before the date which is three hundred sixty five (365) days from the date
such Property is encumbered by the Lien of a Security Instrument. It shall be an
Event of Default under this Agreement if (a) Borrower does not complete the
Required Repairs at each Property within three hundred sixty five (365) days
from the date such Property is encumbered by the Lien of a Security Instrument
or (b) Borrower does not satisfy each condition contained in Section 7.1.2
hereof. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender, at its option, may
withdraw all Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account and Lender
may apply such funds either to completion of the Required Repairs at one or more
of the Properties or toward payment of the Debt in such order, proportion and
priority as Lender may determine in its sole discretion. Lender's right to
withdraw and apply Required Repair Funds shall be in addition to all other
rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

         7.1.2    Release of Required Repair Funds.

         With respect to the Reserve Properties only, Lender shall disburse to
Borrower the Required Repair Funds from the Required Repair Account from time to
time upon satisfaction by Borrower of each of the following conditions: (a)
Borrower shall submit a written request for payment to Lender at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the date on which Borrower requests such payment be made and
specifies the Required Repairs to be paid, (b) on the date such request is
received by Lender and on the date such payment is to be made, no Event of
Default shall exist and remain uncured, (c) Lender shall have received an
Officers' Certificate (i) stating that all Required Repairs at the applicable
Property to be funded by the requested disbursement have been completed in good
and workmanlike manner and, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, in accordance
with all Legal Requirements and Environmental Laws, such certificate to be
accompanied by a copy of any license, permit or other approval by any
Governmental Authority required to commence and/or complete the Required
Repairs, (ii) identifying each Person that supplied materials or labor in
connection with the Required Repairs performed at such Property with respect to
the reimbursement to be funded by the requested disbursement, and (iii) stating
that each such Person has been paid in full upon such disbursement, such
Officers' Certificate to be accompanied by lien waivers or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to Lender, (d) at Lender's option, a title search for such
Property indicating that such Property is free from all Liens, claims and other
encumbrances not previously approved by Lender, and (e) Lender shall have
received such other evidence as Lender shall reasonably request that the
Required Repairs at such Property to be funded by the requested disbursement
have been completed and are paid for upon such disbursement to Borrower. Lender
shall not be required to make disbursements from the Required Repair Account
with respect to any Property unless such requested disbursement is in an amount
greater than $25,000 (or a lesser amount if the total amount in the Required
Repair Account is less than $25,000, in which case only one disbursement of the
amount remaining in the account shall be made). Lender shall not be obligated to
make disbursements from the Required Repair Account with respect to a Property
in excess of the amount allocated for such Property. Upon Lender's receipt of
evidence of completion of all

                                     -107-
<PAGE>

Required Repairs for all Reserve Properties in accordance with the terms hereof,
any remaining Required Repair Funds shall be disbursed to Borrower.

         SECTION 7.2 TAX AND INSURANCE ESCROW FUND.

         With respect to the Reserve Properties only (unless Lender has agreed
to waive such requirement with respect to one or more such Reserve Properties),
Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes
(the "Monthly Tax Deposit") that Lender estimates will be payable during the
next ensuing twelve (12) months in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient
funds to pay all such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to their respective
due dates; and (b) at the option of Lender, if the liability or casualty Policy
maintained by Borrower covering the Properties shall not constitute an approved
blanket or umbrella Policy pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof, or Lender shall
require Borrower to obtain a separate Policy pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof,
one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums (the "Monthly Insurance Premium Deposit")
that Lender estimates will be payable for the renewal of the coverage afforded
by the Policies upon the expiration thereof in order to accumulate with Lender
sufficient funds to pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days
prior to the expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above
hereinafter called the "Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund"). In the event Lender
shall elect to collect payments in escrow for Insurance Premiums pursuant to
clause (b) above, Borrower shall pay to Lender an Initial Deposit to be
determined by Lender, in its sole discretion, to increase the amounts in the Tax
and Insurance Escrow Fund to an amount which, together with anticipated Monthly
Insurance Premium Deposits, shall be sufficient to pay all Insurance Premiums as
they become due. The Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund and the payments of interest
or principal or both, payable pursuant to the Note and this Agreement, shall be
added together and shall be paid as an aggregate sum by Borrower to Lender.
Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund to payments of Taxes and
Insurance Premiums required to be made by Borrower pursuant to Section 5.1.2
hereof. In making any payment relating to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund,
Lender may do so according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the
appropriate public office (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent (with
respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such bill,
statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and
Insurance Escrow Fund shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance
Premiums pursuant to Section 5.1.2 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole discretion,
return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against future payments to
be made to the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund. In allocating such excess, Lender
may deal with the Person shown on the records of Lender to be the owner of the
Properties. Any amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund after the
Debt has been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower. If at any time Lender
reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund is not or will not
be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a)
and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower
shall increase its monthly payments to Lender by the amount that Lender
estimates is sufficient to make up the deficiency at least thirty (30) days
prior to delinquency of the Taxes and/or thirty (30) days prior to expiration of
the Policies, as the case may be.

         SECTION 7.3 REPLACEMENTS AND REPLACEMENT RESERVE.

         7.3.1    Replacement Reserve Fund.

         With respect to the Reserve Properties only (unless Lender has agreed
to waive such requirement with respect to one or more such Reserve Properties),
Borrower shall pay to Lender on each Payment Date, the Replacement Reserve
Monthly Deposit for Capital Expenditures required to be made to such Reserve
Properties during the calendar year, as may be necessary to maintain and operate
first class, reputable hotels in the manner and quality of the hotels operated
at the Properties on the date hereof (collectively, the "Replacements"). Amounts
so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as Borrower's "Replacement Reserve
Fund".

         7.3.2    Disbursements from Replacement Reserve Account.

             (a)      Lender shall make disbursements from the Replacement
     Reserve Account to reimburse Borrower only for the costs of the
     Replacements. Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements from the
     Replacement Reserve Account to reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine
     maintenance (other than Replacements) to a Property or for costs which are
     to be reimbursed from the Required Repair Fund.

             (b)      Lender shall, upon written request from Borrower and
     satisfaction of the requirements set forth in this Section 7.3.2, disburse
     to Borrower amounts from the Replacement Reserve Account necessary to
     reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of Replacements. In no event shall
     Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Replacement Reserve Account
     if an Event of Default exists.

             (c)      Each request for disbursement from the Replacement
     Reserve Account shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Lender and
     shall specify (i) the specific Replacements for which the disbursement is
     requested, (ii) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the
     Replacement includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (iii)
     the price of all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any
     Replacement other than the purchase or replacement of specific items, and
     (iv) the cost of all contracted labor or other services applicable to each
     Replacement for which the disbursement is requested. With each request
     Borrower shall certify that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, all
     Replacements have been made in accordance with all applicable Legal
     Requirements of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
     applicable Property to which the Replacements are being provided. Upon
     request of Lender in connection with each request for disbursement in
     excess of $200,000, Borrower shall provide Lender with copies of invoices
     for amounts in excess of $100,000 for items or materials purchased or
     contracted labor or services. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence of
     completion satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable judgment.

             (d)      Borrower shall pay all invoices in connection with
     the Replacements with respect to each request for disbursement prior to
     submitting such request for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve
     Account or, at the request of Borrower, Lender will issue joint checks,
     payable to Borrower and the contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic,
     subcontractor or other party to whom payment is due in connection with a
     Replacement. In

                                     -109-
<PAGE>

     the case of payments made by joint check, Lender may require a waiver of
     lien from each Person receiving payment prior to Lender's disbursement from
     the Replacement Reserve Account. In addition, as a condition to any
     disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each
     contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives
     payment in an amount equal to or greater than $100,000 for completion of
     its work or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder
     shall conform to the requirements of Applicable Law and shall cover all
     work performed and materials supplied (including equipment and fixtures)
     for the applicable Property by that contractor, supplier, subcontractor,
     mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the current
     reimbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor,
     supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint
     check, the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by
     the previous release of funds request).

             (e)      Borrower shall not make a request for disbursement
     from the Replacement Reserve Account more frequently than once in any
     calendar month and (except in connection with the final disbursement) the
     total cost of all Replacements in any request shall not be less than
     $25,000.

         7.3.3    Performance of Replacements.

             (a)      Borrower shall make Replacements when required in
     order to keep each Property in condition and repair consistent with other
     first class, full service hotels in the same market segment and under the
     same franchisor in the metropolitan area in which the respective Property
     is located, and to keep each Property or any portion thereof from
     deteriorating. Borrower shall complete all Replacements in a good and
     workmanlike manner as soon as practicable following the commencement of
     making each such Replacement.

             (b)      Intentionally Omitted.

             (c)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
     Event of Default, in the event Lender determines in its reasonable
     discretion that any Replacement is not being performed in a workmanlike or
     timely manner or that any Replacement has not been completed in a
     workmanlike or timely manner, Lender shall have the option, without
     providing any prior notice to Borrower, to withhold disbursement for such
     unsatisfactory Replacement and to proceed under existing contracts or, upon
     five (5) Business Days prior written notice to Borrower, to contract with
     third parties to complete such Replacement and to apply the Replacement
     Reserve Fund toward the labor and materials necessary to complete such
     Replacement and to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender
     upon an Event of Default hereunder.

             (d)      In order to facilitate Lender's completion or making
     of the Replacements pursuant to Section 7.3.3(c) above, upon the occurrence
     and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower grants Lender
     the right to enter onto any Property and perform any and all work and labor
     necessary to complete or make the Replacements and/or employ watchmen to
     protect such Property from damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the
     extent not from the Replacement Reserve Fund, shall be deemed to have been
     advanced under

                                     -110-
<PAGE>

     the Loan to Borrower and secured by the Security Instruments. For this
     purpose, Borrower constitutes and appoints Lender its true and lawful
     attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to complete or undertake
     the Replacements in the name of Borrower. Such power of attorney shall be
     deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
     Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any funds in
     the Replacement Reserve Account for the purpose of making or completing the
     Replacements; (ii) to make such additions, changes and corrections to the
     Replacements as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the
     Replacements; (iii) to employ such contractors, subcontractors, agents,
     architects and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; (iv) to
     pay, settle or compromise all existing bills and claims which are or may
     become Liens against any Property, or as may be necessary or desirable for
     the completion of the Replacements, or for clearance of title; (v) to
     execute all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may
     be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to prosecute and defend
     all actions or proceedings in connection with any Property or the
     rehabilitation and repair of any Property; and (vii) to do any and every
     act which Borrower might do in its own behalf to fulfill the terms of this
     Agreement.

             (e)      Nothing in this Section 7.3.3 shall: (i) make Lender
     responsible for making or completing the Replacements; (ii) require Lender
     to expend funds in addition to the Replacement Reserve Fund to make or
     complete any Replacement; (iii) obligate Lender to proceed with the
     Replacements; or (iv) obligate Lender to demand from Borrower additional
     sums to make or complete any Replacement.

             (f)      Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
     representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer,
     architect, or inspector) or third parties making Replacements pursuant to
     this Section 7.3.3 to enter onto each Property during normal business hours
     (subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the
     progress of any Replacements and all materials being used in connection
     therewith, to examine all plans and shop drawings relating to such
     Replacements which are or may be kept at each Property, and to complete any
     Replacements made pursuant to this Section 7.3.3. Borrower shall cause all
     contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender or Lender's
     representatives or such other persons described above in connection with
     inspections described in this Section 7.3.3(f) or the completion of
     Replacements pursuant to this Section 7.3.3.

             (g)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
     Event of Default, Lender may require an inspection of a Property at
     Borrower's expense prior to making a monthly disbursement from the
     Replacement Reserve Account, with respect to each Property, in order to
     verify completion of the Replacements for which reimbursement is sought.
     Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an appropriate
     independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may require a
     copy of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified
     professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of any amounts
     from the Replacement Reserve Account. Borrower shall pay the expense of the
     inspection as required hereunder, whether such inspection is conducted by
     Lender or by an independent qualified professional.

                                     -111-
<PAGE>

             (h)      The Replacements and all materials, equipment,
     fixtures, or any other item comprising a part of any Replacement shall be
     constructed, installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all
     mechanic's, materialmen's or other Liens.

             (i)      Before each disbursement from the Replacement Reserve
     Account relating to actual physical work on the Improvements in excess of
     $200,000 with respect to each Property, Lender may require Borrower to
     provide Lender with a search of title to the applicable Property effective
     to the date of the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's or
     materialmen's Liens or other Liens of any nature have been placed against
     the applicable Property since the date of recordation of the related
     Security Instrument and that title to such Property is free and clear of
     all Liens (other than the Lien of the related Security Instrument and other
     Permitted Encumbrances).

             (j)      All Replacements shall comply with all applicable
     Legal Requirements of all Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over
     the applicable Property and applicable insurance requirements including,
     without limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits,
     environmental regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

             (k)      In addition to any insurance required under the Loan
     Documents, Borrower shall provide or cause to be provided workmen's
     compensation insurance, builder's risk, and public liability insurance and
     other insurance to the extent required under Applicable Law in connection
     with a particular Replacement. All such policies shall be in form and
     amount reasonably satisfactory to Lender. All such policies which can be
     endorsed with standard mortgagee clauses making loss payable to Lender or
     its assigns shall be so endorsed. Certified copies of such policies shall
     be delivered to Lender

         7.3.4    Failure to Make Replacements.

             (a)      It shall be an Event of Default under this Agreement
     if Borrower fails to comply with any provision of this Section 7.3 and such
     failure is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice from
     Lender. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender may use the
     Replacement Reserve Fund (or any portion thereof) for any purpose,
     including but not limited to completion of the Replacements as provided in
     Sections 7.3.3(c) and 7.3.3(d), or for any other repair or replacement to
     any Property or toward payment of the Debt in such order, proportion and
     priority as Lender may determine in its sole discretion. Lender's right to
     withdraw and apply the Replacement Reserve Funds shall be in addition to
     all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement and
     the other Loan Documents.

             (b)      Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to
     apply all or any portion of the Replacement Reserve Fund on account of an
     Event of Default to payment of the Debt or in any specific order or
     priority.

         7.3.5    Balance in the Replacement Reserve Account.

         The insufficiency of any balance in the Replacement Reserve Account
shall not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all preservation and
maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 7.4 GROUND LEASE ESCROW FUND.

         With respect to the Reserve Properties only (unless Lender has agreed
to waive such requirement with respect to one or more such Reserve Properties),
Borrower shall pay to Lender, together with the Monthly Debt Service Payment
Amount, an amount (the "Monthly Ground Rent Deposit") that is estimated by
Lender to be due and payable by Borrower under the Ground Lease for all rent and
any and all other charges (the "Ground Rent") which may be due by Borrower under
the Ground Lease in order to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
sums payable under the Ground Lease at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
dates due (said amounts, hereinafter called the "Ground Lease Escrow Fund"). The
Ground Lease Escrow Fund is for the purpose of paying all sums due under the
Ground Lease. Upon Borrower's failure to pay any Ground Rents after the receipt
of any notice and at least ten (10) days prior to the expiration of any cure
period available to Borrower pursuant to the Ground Lease, Lender may, in its
discretion, apply any amounts held in the Ground Lease Escrow Fund to the
payment of such Ground Rent; provided however, that the provisions of this
Section 7.4 shall not be deemed to create any obligation on the part of Lender
to pay any such Ground Rent from amounts on deposit in the Ground Lease Escrow
Fund. Such deposit may be increased by Lender in the amount Lender deems is
necessary in its reasonable discretion based on any increases in the Ground Rent
due under the Ground Lease. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
7.4 to the contrary, Lender may, in its sole discretion, require Borrower to
post a cash reserve in an amount equal to one payment of Ground Rents due under
each Ground Lease (the "Ground Lease Cash Reserve") in lieu of Borrower making
the Monthly Ground Rent Deposit. Borrower shall have no right to a withdrawal of
(and Lender shall have no obligation to disburse and/or apply) any portion of
the Ground Lease Cash Reserve.

         SECTION 7.5 RESERVE FUNDS, GENERALLY.

             (a)      Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected
     security interest in each of the Reserve Funds and the related Accounts and
     any and all monies now or hereafter deposited in each Reserve Fund and
     related Account as additional security for payment of the Debt. Until
     expended or applied in accordance herewith, the Reserve Funds and the
     related Accounts shall constitute additional security for the Debt.

             (b)      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lender
     may, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies available to
     Lender, apply any sums then present in any or all of the Reserve Funds to
     the payment of the Debt in any order in its sole discretion.

             (c)      The Reserve Funds shall not constitute trust funds
     and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender.

             (d)      The Reserve Funds shall be held in interest bearing
     accounts and all earnings or interest on a Reserve Fund shall be added to
     and become a part of such Reserve Fund and shall be disbursed in the same
     manner as other monies deposited in such Reserve Fund, except that earnings
     or interest on the Tax and Insurance Escrow Fund shall not be added to or
     become a part thereof and shall be the sole property of and shall be paid
     to Lender.

                                     -113-
<PAGE>

             (e)      Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior
     written consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security
     interest in any Reserve Fund or related Account or the monies deposited
     therein or permit any lien or encumbrance to attach thereto, or any levy to
     be made thereon, or any UCC-1 Financing Statements, except those naming
     Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

             (f)      Borrower shall indemnify Lender and hold Lender
     harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims, demands,
     liabilities, losses, damages, obligations and costs and expenses (including
     litigation costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) arising from
     or in any way connected with the Reserve Funds or the related Accounts or
     the performance of the obligations for which the Reserve Funds or the
     related Accounts were established, except to the extent arising from the
     fraud, illegal acts, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender, its
     agents or employees. Borrower shall assign to Lender all rights and claims
     Borrower may have against all Persons supplying labor, materials or other
     services which are to be paid from or secured by the Reserve Funds or the
     related Accounts; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
     right or claim unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured

                                  VIII. DEFAULT

         SECTION 8.1 EVENT OF DEFAULT.

                  (iv)     if a Transfer occurs in violation of the provisions
         of Section 5.2.10 hereof or Article 7 of the Security Instruments;

         herein or in any other Loan Document, or in any report, certificate,
         financial statement or other instrument, agreement or document
         furnished to Lender shall have been false or misleading in any material
         respect as of the date the representation or warranty was made;

                  (vi)     if Borrower, an Operating Lessee SPE Entity,

         in connection with the Loan or if Borrower, Principal, an Operating
         Lessee SPE Entity, Indemnitor, Guarantor or such other guarantor shall
         be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or if any petition for
         bankruptcy, reorganization or arrangement pursuant to the Bankruptcy
         Code, or any similar federal or State law, shall be filed by or
         against, consented to, or acquiesced in by, Borrower, Principal, an

         Borrower, Principal, an Operating Lessee SPE Entity, Indemnitor,
         Guarantor or such other guarantor shall be instituted; provided,
         however, if such appointment, adjudication, petition or proceeding was
         involuntary and not consented to by Borrower, Principal, an Operating
         Lessee SPE Entity, Indemnitor, Guarantor or such other guarantor, upon

         forth herein which specifically contains a notice requirement or grace
         period, if Borrower shall be in default under such term, covenant or
         condition after the giving of such notice or the expiration of such
         grace period;

                  (xxi)    if any default occurs under the Operating Lease
         Subordination Agreement, and such default continues after the
         expiration of applicable grace or cure periods, if any;

                  (xxii)   if there shall occur any material default under the
         Operating Lease, in the observance or performance of any term, covenant
         or condition of the Operating Lease to be observed or performed and
         said default is not cured following the expiration of any applicable

                  (xxiv)   Intentionally Omitted;

                  (xxv)    if there shall occur (A) any uncured default in the
         payment of Ground Rent by Borrower or (B) any other material default by
         Borrower, as tenant under any Ground Lease, in the observance or
         performance of any term, covenant or condition of such Ground Lease on
         the part of Borrower to be observed or performed and said default is
         not cured following the expiration of any applicable grace and notice
         periods therein provided, or if the leasehold estate created by such
         Ground Lease shall be surrendered or if such Ground Lease shall cease
         to be in full force and effect or such Ground Lease shall be terminated
         or canceled for any reason or under any circumstances whatsoever, or if
         any of the terms, covenants or conditions of such Ground Lease shall in
         any manner be modified, changed, supplemented, altered, or amended

                  (xxvi)   if (a) a material default has occurred and continues
         beyond any applicable cure period under the Franchise Agreement, and
         such default permits a party to terminate or cancel the Franchise
         Agreement or (b) any Franchise Agreement expires or otherwise
         terminates and is not replaced with a replacement Franchise Agreement
         reasonably acceptable to Lender;

                  (xxvii)  if Borrower ceases to operate a hotel on any Property
         or terminates such business for any reason whatsoever (other than
         temporary cessation in connection with any renovations to a Property or
         restoration of the Property after Casualty or Condemnation);

                  (xxviii) if Borrower terminates or cancels the Franchise
         Agreement, without Lender's prior written consent;

                  (xxix)   if Borrower shall continue to be in Default under any
         of the other terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement not
         specified in subsections (i) to (xxviii) above, for ten (10) days after
         written notice to Borrower from Lender, in the case of any Default
         which can be cured by the payment of a sum of money, or for thirty (30)
         days after written notice from Lender in the case of any other Default;
         provided, however, that if such non-monetary Default is susceptible of
         cure but cannot reasonably be cured within such 30-day period and
         provided further that Borrower shall have commenced to cure such
         Default within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently
         and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such thirty (30) day
         period shall be extended for such time as is reasonably necessary for
         Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such Default, such
         additional period not to exceed sixty (60) days; or

                  (xxx)    if there shall be default under the Security
         Instruments or any of the other Loan Documents beyond any applicable
         notice and cure periods contained in such documents, whether as to
         Borrower or any Property, or if any other such event shall occur or
         condition shall exist, if the effect of such event or condition is to
         accelerate the maturity of any portion of the Debt or to permit Lender
         to accelerate the maturity of all or any portion of the Debt.

             (b)      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other
     than an Event of Default described in clauses Section 8.1(a)(vi) or (vii)
     above) and at any time thereafter, in addition to any other rights or
     remedies available to it pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
     Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take such action, without
     notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect and enforce its
     rights against Borrower and in and to all or any Property, including,
     without limitation, declaring the Debt to be immediately due and payable,
     and Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or remedies
     provided in the Loan Documents against Borrower and any or all of the
     Properties, including, without limitation, all rights or remedies available
     at law or in equity; and upon any Event of Default described in clauses
     Section 8.1(a)(vi) or (vii) above, the Debt and all other obligations of
     Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall immediately and
     automatically become due and payable, without notice or demand, and
     Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything
     contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary
     notwithstanding.

         SECTION 8.2 REMEDIES.

             (a)      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or
     any one or more of the rights, powers, privileges and other remedies
     available to Lender against Borrower under this Agreement or any of the
     other Loan Documents executed and delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower
     or at law or in equity may be exercised by Lender at any time and from time
     to time, whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be declared due and
     payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any foreclosure
     proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and remedies
     under any of the Loan Documents with respect to all or any Property or any
     other Collateral. Any such actions taken by Lender shall be cumulative and
     concurrent and may be pursued independently, singly, successively, together
     or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in its
     sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, without
     impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender
     permitted by Applicable Law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or
     in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is continuing (i)
     Lender is not subject to any "one action" or "election of remedies" law or
     rule, and (ii) all Liens and other rights, remedies or privileges provided
     to Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender has exhausted
     all of its remedies against the Properties and the other Collateral and
     each Security Instrument has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise
     realized upon in satisfaction of the Debt or the Debt has been paid in
     full.

             (b)      With respect to Borrower and the Properties, nothing
     contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall be construed as
     requiring Lender to resort to any Property or Collateral for the
     satisfaction of any of the Debt in preference or priority to any other
     Property or Collateral, and Lender may seek satisfaction out of all of the
     Properties or any other Collateral or any part thereof, in its absolute
     discretion in respect of the Debt. In addition, Lender shall have the right
     from time to time to partially foreclose the Security Instruments in any
     manner and for any amounts secured by the Security Instruments then due and
     payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion including, without
     limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event Borrower

                                     -118-
<PAGE>

     defaults beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more
     scheduled payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose one or
     more of the Security Instruments to recover such delinquent payments, or
     (ii) in the event Lender elects to accelerate less than the entire
     outstanding principal balance of the Loan, Lender may foreclose one or more
     of the Security Instruments to recover so much of the principal balance of
     the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by one or
     more of the Security Instruments as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one
     or more partial foreclosures, the Properties shall remain subject to the
     Security Instruments to secure payment of sums secured by the Security
     Instruments and not previously recovered.

             (c)      Lender shall have the right, from time to time, to
     sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate
     notes, mortgages and other security documents (the "Severed Loan
     Documents") in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its sole
     discretion for purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies
     provided hereunder. Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender from time
     to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and
     such other documents as Lender shall request in order to effect the
     severance described in the preceding sentence, all in form and substance
     reasonably satisfactory to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and
     irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with
     an interest, in its name and stead to make and execute all documents
     necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower
     ratifying all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof; provided,
     however, Lender shall not make or execute any such documents under such
     power until three (3) days after notice has been given to Borrower by
     Lender of Lender's intent to exercise its rights under such power. The
     Severed Loan Documents shall not contain any representations, warranties or
     covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations
     and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by
     Borrower only as of the Closing Date.

         SECTION 8.3 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS.

         The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's rights, powers
and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time
and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's sole discretion. No delay
or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of
Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a
waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time
to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one or more
Defaults or Events of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be construed to
be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to
impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

                             IX. SPECIAL PROVISIONS

         SECTION 9.1 CONVERSION TO FIXED RATE CMBS LOANS.

         9.1.1    Conversion.

         On or before the Maturity Date, but subject to the Conversion
Limitations, Lender may, in one or a series of transactions, convert all or any
portion of the outstanding balance of the Loan to one or more Fixed Rate CMBS
Loans (each, a "Conversion") subject to the terms and conditions set forth
below; provided, however, Lender shall not give notice to Borrower of its intent
to consummate a Conversion for a period of sixty (60) days beginning on the date
Lender actually receives a Floating Rate Conversion Notice. Upon Lender's
exercise of the Conversion and the execution of the Conversion Documents, the
portion of the Loan that is the subject of such Conversion shall automatically
convert into a Fixed Rate CMBS Loan and the Property secured thereby shall no
longer be deemed a Property hereunder. Lender shall not have the right to
exercise a Conversion unless and until the conditions in subsection (i), (ii)
and (iii) below have been satisfied.

                  (i)      Lender shall have given notice (a "Conversion
         Notice") to Borrower of the date of Conversion (the "Conversion Date");
         which notice shall be given to Borrower at least thirty (30) days prior
         to the Conversion Date unless Lender has waived Borrower's obligation
         to comply with the provisions of Section 9.1.1(iv)(A), (C) and (D)
         hereof.

                  (ii)     Prior to any Conversion, Lender shall consult with
         Borrower with respect to the selection of the Property which will be
         the collateral for such Fixed Rate CMBS Loan (the "Fixed Rate CMBS
         Collateral"), but in no event shall Lender be bound by any
         recommendation or request of Borrower pertaining to such Fixed Rate
         CMBS Collateral and Lender shall select the Fixed Rate CMBS Collateral
         in its sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that (A) the
         Fixed Rate CMBS Collateral shall not be comprised of more than one (1)
         Property and (B) the original principal balance of the Fixed Rate CMBS
         Loan shall be equal to the maximum amount in order for the Fixed Rate
         CMBS Loan to achieve (i) a Debt Service Coverage Ratio of not less than
         1.30:1.00 and (ii) a ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (I) the
         original principal balance of the Fixed Rate CMBS Loan divided by (II)
         the Property Value of the Fixed Rate CMBS Collateral, of not more than
         sixty percent (60%) (the "Conversion Parameters").

                  (iii)    Lender shall have provided Borrower with all of the
         Conversion Amended Loan Documents not later than five (5) Business Days
         prior to the Conversion Date;

                  (iv)     Borrower shall have delivered, among other things,
         the following documents to Lender at Borrower's sole cost and expense,
         which documents shall be in form, content and substance acceptable to
         Lender in its sole discretion (the "Conversion Documents"):

                           (A)      an update, dated not more than thirty (30)
                  days prior to the Conversion Date, of all of the Third Party
                  Reports of the applicable Property

                                     -120-
<PAGE>

                  accepted by Lender in connection with the closing of the Loan;
                  provided, however, (i) such update(s) shall be ordered by
                  Lender and paid for by Borrower and (ii) no such update shall
                  be required with respect to a Third Party Report in the event
                  that the Conversion Date occurs less than two hundred seventy
                  (270) days from the date such Third Party Report was obtained
                  and approved by Lender in accordance with the closing of the
                  Loan;

                           (B)      a Title Insurance Policy (or a marked,
                  signed and redated commitment to issue such Title Insurance
                  Policy) insuring the Lien of the Security Instrument
                  encumbering the Fixed Rate CMBS Collateral, issued by the
                  title insurance company that issued the Title Insurance Policy
                  on the Closing Date (or such other title company acceptable to
                  Lender) and dated as of the Conversion Date, with reinsurance
                  and direct access agreements acceptable to Lender. The Title
                  Insurance Policy issued with respect to the Fixed Rate CMBS
                  Loan shall (1) provide coverage in the amount of the original
                  principal amount of the Fixed Rate CMBS Loan, (2) insure
                  Lender that the relevant mortgage creates a valid first lien
                  on the Fixed Rate CMBS Collateral encumbered thereby, free and
                  clear of all exceptions from coverage other than Permitted
                  Encumbrances and standard exceptions and exclusions from
                  coverage (as modified by the terms of any endorsements), (3)
                  contain such endorsements and affirmative coverages as are
                  then available and are reasonably required by Lender, and (4)
                  name Lender as the insured. Lender also shall have received
                  copies of paid receipts or other evidence showing that all
                  premiums in respect of such endorsements and Title Insurance
                  Policy have been paid;

                           (C)      a Franchisor Estoppel and Recognition
                  Letter, dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the
                  Conversion Date, from the Franchisor under the Franchise
                  Agreement, if any;

                           (D)      estoppel certificates dated not more than
                  thirty (30) days prior to the Conversion Date, from Manager,
                  Operating Lessor and tenants under Major Leases;

                           (E)      a certification by Borrower that as of the
                  Conversion Date, no proceedings shall have been threatened or
                  commenced by a Governmental Authority having the power of
                  eminent domain to condemn any portion of the Property;

                           (F)      if not previously delivered to Lender
                  pursuant to Section 5.1.10 hereof, updated financial
                  statements containing information consistent with those
                  financial statements required pursuant to Section 5.1.10
                  hereof; and

                           (G)      a certificate executed by Borrower and
                  FelCor at Conversion in substantially the form attached to
                  this Agreement as EXHBIT AA (a "Conversion Certificate").

                                     -121-
<PAGE>

                  (v)      Borrower and, if applicable, FelCor shall have
         executed and delivered to Lender loan documents substantially in the
         form of EXHIBIT BB hereto and such amendments to the Note, this
         Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents as Lender may reasonably
         require to evidence the Conversion (the "Conversion Amended Loan
         Documents"); which Conversion Amended Loan Documents (A) will require,
         among other things, (1) reserves and/or escrow as reasonably determined
         by Lender, including, without limitation, tax and insurance escrows,
         replacement reserves and required repair reserves and (2) cash
         management provisions (or reserves in lieu thereof satisfactory to
         Lender in all respects) in the event the original principal balance of
         the applicable Fixed Rate CMBS Loan equals or exceeds $15,000,000 and
         (B) will not require any financial statements of Borrower and/or
         Operating Lessee to be audited by a certified public accountant.

                  (vi)     Lender shall have received (A) an opinion of counsel
         with respect to the execution, delivery and enforceability of the
         Conversion Amended Loan Documents and (B) an update or revised
         Insolvency Opinion, each such opinion shall be in form, scope and from
         counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender; and

                  (vii)    Borrower shall have satisfied, or caused the
         satisfaction of, such other requirements and/or conditions as are then
         reasonably being required by Lender with respect to fixed rate loans
         being made by Lender for the purpose of resale into the secondary
         mortgage market (including, without limitation, the execution and
         delivery by Borrower of any supplemental documentation then reasonably
         being required by Lender).

         9.1.2    Fixed Rate CMBS Loan Provisions.

                  (a)      Each Fixed Rate CMBS Loan shall have a term of ten
         (10) years and require amortization payments based on a twenty-five
         (25) year schedule. Except to the extent expressly set forth herein or
         in the Conversion Amended Loan Documents, Lender shall determine the
         terms and conditions of all other provisions of the Fixed Rate CMBS
         Loan, all of which shall be determined by Lender in its reasonable
         discretion in accordance with Lender's then current criteria pursuant
         to which Lender is then originating commercial mortgage loans solely
         for sale in the secondary mortgage market, as the same may change from
         time to time (the "Commercial Lending Program Criteria"); provided,
         however, in the event of any inconsistencies between the terms and
         conditions of the Conversion Amended Loan Documents and the provisions
         of the then current Commercial Lending Program Criteria, the terms and
         conditions of the then current Commercial Lending Program Criteria
         shall control and be binding, except with respect to the determination
         of the applicable interest rate and the CMBS Loan Amount for which the
         terms and conditions of the Conversion Amended Loan Documents shall
         control and be binding.

                  (b)      The applicable interest rate for each Fixed Rate CMBS
         Loan (the "Fixed Rate CMBS Rate") shall be fixed on the Conversion Date
         and shall be determined by Lender based upon the greater of (i) 5.55%
         and (ii) the sum of (A) the yield to maturity for the "on-the-run"
         10-year U.S. Treasury note; plus (B) the offered side of the 10-year
         swap rate; plus (C) 160 basis points; plus (D) the Spread Adjustment.

                                     -122-
<PAGE>

                  (c)      No Fixed Rate CMBS Loan shall be cross-collateralized
         or cross-defaulted with any additional loan or indebtedness and, the
         applicable Borrower shall be released by Lender from any and all
         indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities with respect to the
         Loan.

                  (d)      Lender shall endeavor in good faith to make the

         during the term of the Loan or (C) if Lender shall have previously
         delivered a notice of Conversion relating to the proposed Floating Rate
         CMBS Collateral;

                  (ii)     Borrower shall have delivered written notice to
         Lender (the "Floating Rate Conversion Notice") not less than sixty (60)
         days prior to the requested date of Floating Rate CMBS Conversion (the

         Documents at the time of delivery of the Floating Rate Conversion
         Notice and on the Floating Rate Conversion Date;

                  (iv)     at the time of Borrower's request for Floating Rate

         greater than $25,000,000.00;

                  (v)      the original principal balance of the Floating Rate
         CMBS Loan must be not less than $50,000,000.00 and not more than
         $75,000,000.00; provided, however, (A) Lender shall not give Borrower
         notice of its intent to consummate a Conversion for a period of sixty
         (60) days beginning on the date Lender actually receives the Floating
         Rate Conversion Notice, and (B) on or before the Floating Rate
         Conversion Date, Borrower may obtain an Advance to increase the
         outstanding principal balance of the Loan to an aggregate amount not
         less than $50,000,000.00 and not more than $75,000,000.00;

                  (vi)     Lender shall determine in its reasonable discretion

         expected to (A) cause the Floating Rate CMBS Loan to become in default
         or (B) adversely affect the value or marketability of the Floating Rate
         CMBS Loan;

                  (ix)     Borrower and, if applicable, FelCor shall have
         executed and delivered to Lender loan documents substantially in the
         form of EXHIBIT CC hereto and such amendments to the Note, this
         Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents as Lender may reasonably
         require to evidence the Floating Rate CMBS Conversion (the "Floating
         Rate Conversion Documents") which Lender shall have provided to
         Borrower not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Floating
         Rate Conversion Date; provided, however, in the event of any
         inconsistencies between the terms and conditions of the Floating Rate

         with respect to the execution, delivery and enforceability of the
         Floating Rate Conversion Documents and (B) an update or revised
         Insolvency Opinion, each such opinion shall be in form, scope and from
         counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender; and

                  (xi)     Borrower shall have paid to Lender the origination
         fee required pursuant to Section 9.2.2(a)(iv) hereof.

             (b)      Borrower shall have satisfied, or caused the

     all other provisions of the Floating Rate CMBS Loan, all of which shall be
     determined by Lender in its reasonable discretion in accordance with
     Lender's Commercial Lending Program Criteria.

         NEW YORK OR ANY CORRESPONDING OR SUCCEEDING PROVISIONS THEREOF.

         SECTION 10.4 MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING.

         No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, the Note, or of any other Loan Document, nor
consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against whom
enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only
in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

         SECTION 10.5 DELAY NOT A WAIVER.

         Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender or Borrower in
insisting upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement,
or exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note
or under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to
declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

         SECTION 10.6 NOTICES.

to have been properly given (i) upon delivery, if delivered in person or by

         SECTION 10.7 TRIAL BY JURY.

         BORROWER AND LENDER HEREBY AGREE NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO
THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE
LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION
THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER AND LENDER, AND IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY
EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD
OTHERWISE ACCRUE. BORROWER AND LENDER ARE HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF
THIS PARAGRAPH IN ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY
BORROWER AND LENDER, AS APPLICABLE.

         SECTION 10.8 HEADINGS.

         The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

         SECTION 10.9 SEVERABILITY.

         Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
Applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.10 PREFERENCES.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Lender shall have the
continuing and exclusive right to apply or reverse and reapply any and all
payments by Borrower to any portion of the obligations of Borrower hereunder. To
the extent Borrower makes a payment or payments to Lender, which payment or
proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be
fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee,
receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, State or federal law,
common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds
received, the obligations hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such payment or
proceeds had not been received by Lender.

         SECTION 10.11 WAIVER OF NOTICE.

         Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

         SECTION 10.12 REMEDIES OF BORROWER.

         In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment.

         SECTION 10.13 EXPENSES; INDEMNITY.

                  (a)      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
         Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
         reimburse, Lender within five (5) days of receipt of written notice
         from Lender for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
         attorneys' fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender in connection
         with (i) the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of
         furnishing all opinions by counsel for Borrower (including without
         limitation any opinions requested by Lender as to any legal matters
         arising under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents with respect
         to the Properties); (ii) Borrower's ongoing performance of and
         compliance with Borrower's respective agreements and covenants
         contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to
         be performed or complied with after the Closing Date, including,
         without limitation, confirming compliance with environmental and
         insurance requirements; (iii) Lender's ongoing performance and
         compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or
         complied with after the Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation,
         preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any consents,
         amendments, waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents and any other documents or matters requested by
         Lender; (v) securing Borrower's compliance with any requests made
         pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; (vi) the filing and
         recording fees and expenses, title insurance and reasonable fees and
         expenses of counsel for providing to Lender all required legal
         opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and
         perfecting the Liens in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and
         the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing or preserving any rights, in
         response to third party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any
         action or proceeding or other litigation, in each case against, under
         or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
         Properties, or any other security given for the Loan; and (viii)
         enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments due from
         Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect
         to the Properties or in connection with any refinancing or
         restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement
         in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy
         proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable for
         the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise
         by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
         misconduct of Lender. Any cost and expenses due and payable to Lender
         may be paid from any amounts in the Lockbox Account.

                  (b)      Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
         Lender from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations,
         losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs,
         expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including,
         without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
         for Lender in connection with any investigative, administrative or
         judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not Lender
         shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred
         by, or asserted against Lender in any manner relating to or arising out
         of (i) any breach by Borrower of its obligations under, or any material
         misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the other
         Loan

                                     -133-
<PAGE>

         Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan
         (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, however, that
         Borrower shall not have any obligation to Lender hereunder to the
         extent that such Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal
         acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the
         undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless set forth in the
         preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law or
         public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that it is
         permitted to pay and satisfy under Applicable Law to the payment and
         satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Lender.

                  (c)      Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense,
         protect, defend, indemnify, release and hold harmless Lender and the
         Indemnified Parties from and against any and all losses (including,
         without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in
         the investigation, defense, and settlement of losses incurred in
         correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
         loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption
         under ERISA, the Code, any State statute or other similar law that may
         be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
         directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Sections 4.1.8
         or 5.2.8 hereof.

                  (d)      Other than in connection with a Securitization,
         Borrower covenants and agrees to pay for or, if Borrower fails to pay,
         to reimburse Lender for, (i) any fees and expenses incurred by any
         Rating Agency in connection with any Rating Agency review of the Loan,
         the Loan Documents or any transaction contemplated thereby or (ii) any
         consent, approval, waiver or confirmation obtained from such Rating
         Agency pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any
         other Loan Document and Lender shall be entitled to require payment of
         such fees and expenses as a condition precedent to the obtaining of any
         such consent, approval, waiver or confirmation.

         SECTION 10.14 SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS INCORPORATED.

         The Schedules and Exhibits annexed hereto are hereby incorporated
herein as a part of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the
body hereof.

         SECTION 10.15 OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES.

         Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to the Loan Documents which
Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of the Loan Documents, and no
such unrelated counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by
Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such
documents and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset,
counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly
waived by Borrower.

         SECTION 10.16 NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
                       BENEFICIARIES.

                  (a)      Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships
         created hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of
         borrower and lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a
         joint venture, partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint

                                     -134-
<PAGE>

     tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor to grant Lender any
     interest in the Properties other than that of mortgagee, beneficiary or
     lender.

                  (b)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
         solely for the benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in
         this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer
         upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower (or an Affiliate of either
         of the foregoing acting on behalf of Borrower or Lender, as applicable)
         any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
         any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to
         the obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely
         and exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall
         have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance
         with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to
         make the Loan in the absence of strict compliance with any or all
         thereof and no other Person shall under any circumstances be deemed to
         be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of which may be freely
         waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole discretion,
         Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

         SECTION 10.17 PUBLICITY.

         All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or their
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents, to
Lender, JPMorgan Chase, or any of their Affiliates shall be subject to the prior
written approval of Lender, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, disclosure required by any federal or State
securities laws, rules or regulations, as determined by Borrower's counsel,
shall not be subject to the prior written approval of Lender.

         SECTION 10.18 CROSS-DEFAULT; CROSS-COLLATERALIZATION; WAIVER OF
MARSHALLING OF ASSETS.

                  (a)      Borrower acknowledges that Lender has made the Loan
         to Borrower upon the security of its collective interest in the
         Properties and in reliance upon the aggregate of the Properties taken
         together being of greater value as collateral security than the sum of
         each Property taken separately. Borrower agrees that the Security
         Instruments are and will be cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted
         with each other so that (i) an Event of Default under any of the
         Security Instruments shall constitute an Event of Default under each of
         the other Security Instruments which secure the Note; (ii) an Event of
         Default under the Note or this Agreement shall constitute an Event of
         Default under each Security Instrument; (iii) each Security Instrument
         shall constitute security for the Note as if a single blanket lien were
         placed on all of the Properties as security for the Note; and (iv) such
         cross-collateralization shall in no event be deemed to constitute a
         fraudulent conveyance.

                  (b)      To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
         Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns, waives all rights
         to a marshalling of the assets of Borrower and of the Properties, or to
         a sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of
         all or any of the Security Instruments, and agrees not to assert any
         right under any laws

                                      -135-

<PAGE>

         pertaining to the marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of
         alienation, homestead exemption, the administration of estates of
         decedents, or any other matters whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect
         the right of Lender under the Loan Documents to a sale of the
         Properties for the collection of the Debt without any prior or
         different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
         payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Properties in
         preference to every other claimant whatsoever. In addition, Borrower,
         for itself and its successors and assigns, waives in the event of
         foreclosure of any or all of the Security Instruments, any equitable
         right otherwise available to Borrower which would require the separate
         sale of the Properties or require Lender to exhaust its remedies
         against any Property or any combination of the Properties before
         proceeding against any other Property or combination of Properties; and
         further in the event of such foreclosure Borrower does hereby expressly
         consent to and authorize, at the option of Lender, the foreclosure and
         sale either separately or together of any combination of the
         Properties.

         SECTION 10.19 WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM.

         Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

         SECTION 10.20 CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE.

         In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which
govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower,
and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take
any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of
any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the
business of real estate financings and other real estate transactions and
investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business
of Borrower or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 10.21 BROKERS AND FINANCIAL ADVISORS.

         Borrower and Lender hereby represent that they have dealt with no
financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents, agents or finders
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Borrower
hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and against any
and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind (including Lender's
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in any way relating to or arising

                                      -136-

<PAGE>

from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of Borrower in
connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The provisions of this
Section 10.21 shall survive the expiration and termination of this Agreement and
the payment of the Debt.

         SECTION 10.22 PRIOR AGREEMENTS.

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written, between Borrower and/or its Affiliates and
Lender are superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

         SECTION 10.23 COUNTERPARTS.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of duplicate originals and
each duplicate original shall be deemed to be an original. This Agreement may be
executed in several counterparts, each of which counterparts shall be deemed an
original instrument and all of which together shall constitute a single
Agreement.

         SECTION 10.24 LIABILITY.

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
Borrower and Lender and their respective successors and assigns forever.

         SECTION 10.25 BORROWER/MAKER.

         In the event that the Maryland Guaranty is released as security for the
Loan, all references herein to "Borrower" shall refer solely to "Maker".

                         [NO FURTHER TEXT ON THIS PAGE]

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed and delivered this
Agreement as of the date first above written.

                                        LENDER:
