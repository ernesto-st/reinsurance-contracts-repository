(C) That the Administrator shall be responsible to ensure that its operations and the business produced            complies with all applicable laws and regulations.

In the event the performance of any duty or obligation of the Administrator herein            would constitute the unauthorized practice of insurance by the Company in an applicable jurisdiction,            the  Administrator  shall  immediately  notify  the  Company  and  this  Agreement  shall  be  immediately            suspended or modified in such jurisdiction.  If such a suspension shall frustrate the purposes of this            Agreement, the Agreement shall terminate unless the parties agree to amend this Agreement so that            the performance by the Administrator does not constitute the unauthorized practice of insurance by the            Company.

Before            the  Administrator  destroys  or  discards  any  of  such  records,  the  Administrator  agrees  to  give  the            Company 60 days written notice of its intention to do so.  If during that 60 day period the Company            expresses the desire to maintain such files, the Administrator shall, at Company&#8217;s expense, send or            deliver such files to the location directed by Company.

Profit Sharing will be paid by Company to Administrator within 15 days of receipt from Administrator of annual  Profit Sharing calculations (to be provided on or about March 15).   A. Commission   The  Administrator  will  earn  commission  based  on  gross  written  premiums  per  policy  (&#8220;Commission&#8221;).   Commissionable premiums are exclusive of Surcharges and policy fees. Should this agreement terminate  for any reason Administrator agrees to return to the Company all Commission on those policies that are  canceled in a fashion consistent with monthly bordereaux statements.    The Commission allowable under this Agreement shall vary by state in accordance with the list below:      &#8226;  LA, SC, AL            o  New Business &#8211; [***] of gross written commissionable premium           o  Renewals &#8211; [***] of gross written commissionable premium      &#8226;  [***], [***], [***], [***], [***], [***], [***], [***] &#8211; To Be Mutually Agreed           B. Policy Fees and Inspection Fees   Only as allowed by law may the Administrator earn 100% of all policy fees and inspection fees collected.  Should prevailing rules and regulations differ, the Company will fully cooperate with the Administrator to  preserve the Administrator&#8217;s right to the policy fees and inspection fees.   C. Setup Fees and Installment Fees on Payment Plans   The  Administrator  will  collect  and  retain  100%  of  setup  fees  and  installment  fees  on  payment  plans  in  exchange for coverage costs of bank accounts, credit card fees, ACH fees and lockbox fees associated with  this Agreement.     D. Profit Sharing   The Administrator will earn a profit sharing payment annually based on performance.  Company will provide  Administrator with any financial information needed to calculation profit sharing no later than March 1 of each  year. This information includes, but is not limited to, actual loss amounts paid and case reserves, actual  reinsurance costs and associated allocation calculations and premium taxes.   The intent of the profit sharing arrangement is to establish a sharing of the inception to date profits generated  under this Agreement excluding any considerations for Quota Share.  For the purposes of the profit sharing  calculations, Quota Share reinsurance will be excluded from all calculations. The parties agree that if the  25  AM 20767075.1  </FONT></DIV>

Over the cumulative term of this  Agreement, if the margin is greater than 0% but less than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the  margin. If the margin is greater than [***] and less than [***], the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the margin  in excess of [***]. If the profit margin is less than [***], there is no profit sharing.   The following describes in terms of mathematical expressions the approach to the computation over the life  of this Agreement.     Profit sharing payments shall be based on the calculation set forth below.   Profit Sharing Calculations   &#8220;ITD&#8221;  means Inception-to-Date  for  all  premiums  subject  to  this  Agreement.   For  the  purposes  of  all  calculations, Inception-to-Date refers to measurements for the period starting July 1, 2013 through the latest  measurement period for all premiums subject to this Agreement.  For example, ITD Gross Earned Premium  (or ITD GEP) for the year-end 2014 profit sharing calculations, as calculated in early 2015, is the total Gross  Earned Premium for the periods from July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014 and would be defined as ITD  GEP or ITD GEP(t).  For the same measurement date in early 2015, ITD GEP(t-1) is defined as the inception- to-date GEP as of the prior year from July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013.  The first measurement  period will be for 2013 based on the period from inception through December 31, 2013.   Profit Sharing Account(t) = ITD Profit    Profit Share Account Increase(t) = Profit Sharing Account (t) - Profit Sharing Account (t-1)   Current  Year  Gross  Earned  Premiums  =  Gross  Earned  Premiums(t)  =  GEP(t)  =  ITD  Gross Earned  Premiums(t) - ITD Gross Earned Premiums(t-1)   ITD Margin = ITD Profit / ITD GEP   If ITD Margin &gt;= [***] THEN         ITD Profit Sharing = [(ITD Margin - [***]) * [***] + [***]] * ITD GEP   If ITD Margin &gt;= [***] AND ITD Margin &lt; [***] THEN          ITD Profit Sharing = (ITD Margin - [***]) * ITD GEP   ELSE         ITD Profit Sharing = 0   Profit Sharing Earned(t) = MAX[ITD Profit Sharing - SUM(Profit Sharing Earned(i)) for all i &lt; t,0]   If Profit Sharing Earned(t) &gt; 0 then Profit Sharing Payments will be made [***] immediately, [***] one year  later and [***] two years later.  Company will pay the first installment within 15 days of the receipt of final  calculations from Administrator (on or about February 15).  The subsequent two installments will be paid one  year and two years later.   General Definitions         ITD Profit (before profit sharing payments) =  26  AM 20767075.1  </FONT></DIV>

Buy-Down Layer Cost is     equal to the cost of placing Buy-Down Layer for ONLY business covered under this agreement.  If the     Buy-Down Layer is not purchased by Company, then the Buy-Down Layer Cost is equal to [***] times     modeled AAL at September 30 of the respective year.           Shared Corporate Layer for the 2013 catastrophe year attaches at $7 million and exhausts at 100-year     Return Period PML. The Shared Corporate Layer for 2014 catastrophe year and beyond will attach at     the level of Company&#8217;s corporate catastrophe reinsurance purchase and exhaust at the 100-year Return     Period PML (this amount may be increased if required by regulatory or Demotech requirements). The     Shared Corporate Layer Cost will be calculated using the Company&#8217;s AIR / RMS average AAL for each     reinsurance layer purchased times Administrator program AIR / RMS average AAL at September 30.      Parties will mutually agree on reasonable estimate of AIR / RMS average AAL multiples for layers that     are only partially covered by Shared Corporate Layer.        Given that Company reinsurance program incepts at July 1 of each year, 6/12 of costs in this section     are from current catastrophe year and 6/12 from prior catastrophe year.  For example, 2014 calendar     year costs for this calculation are based on 1/2 of 2013 catastrophe year costs and 1/2 of 2014     catastrophe year costs.      b) Costs incurred for the Calendar Year in the purchase of Per Risk Reinsurance including XOL Treaty,     Facultative, ID Theft and any other Reinsurance.  For example, if the treaty incepts on July 1 of the     year, the Calendar Year charge is 6/12 of the cost of the cost of the treaty incepting on July 1 of the     preceding year and 6/12 of the cost of the treaty incepting in the current Calendar Year.    c) Calendar Year Incurred Losses and ALAE (including the benefit of subrogation).    d) ULAE Charge is [***] of Earned Premiums.      27  AM 20767075.1  </FONT></DIV>

Profit Sharing will be paid by Company to Administrator within 15 days of receipt from Administrator of annual  Profit Sharing calculations (to be provided on or about March 15).   A. Commission  The  Administrator  will  earn  commission  based  on  gross  written  premiums  per  policy  (&#8220;Commission&#8221;).   Commissionable premiums are exclusive of Surcharges and policy fees. Should this agreement terminate  for any reason Administrator agrees to return to the Company all Commission on those policies that are  canceled in a fashion consistent with monthly bordereaux statements.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">D. Profit Sharing  The Administrator will earn a profit sharing payment annually based on performance.  Company will provide  Administrator with any financial information needed to calculate profit sharing no later than March 1 of each  year. This information includes, but is not limited to, actual loss amounts paid and case reserves, actual  reinsurance costs and associated allocation calculations and premium taxes.   The intent of the profit sharing arrangement is to establish a sharing of the inception to date profits generated  under this Agreement. The parties agree that if the profit margin (defined based on ITD Profit divided by ITD  Gross Earned Premium) is greater than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the margin over [***]  of the gross profit. Over the cumulative term of this Agreement, if the profit margin is greater than [***] but  less than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to 0.0% of the profit margin. If the profit margin is greater  than [***] and less than [***], the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin in excess of [***] If the  profit margin is less than [***], there is no profit sharing.   The following describes in terms of mathematical expressions the approach to the computation over the life  of this Agreement.     Profit sharing payments shall be based on the calculation set forth below.   Profit Sharing Calculations   &#8220;ITD&#8221; means Inception-to-Date for all revenues subject to this Agreement, which shall include all premiums,  policy fees, inspection fees, setup fees and installment fees on payment plans collected on business written  pursuant to this Agreement.  For the purposes of all calculations, Inception-to-Date refers to measurements  for the period starting July 1, 2013 through the latest measurement period for all revenues subject to this  Agreement.  For example, ITD Gross Earned Premium (or ITD GEP) for the year-end 2014 profit sharing  calculations, as calculated in early 2015, is the total Gross Earned Premium for the periods from July 1, 2013  through December 31, 2014 and would be defined as ITD GEP or ITD GEP(t).  For the same measurement  date in early 2015, ITD GEP(t-1) is defined as the inception-to-date GEP as of the prior year from July 1,  2013 through December 31, 2013.  The first measurement period will be for 2013 based on the period from  inception through December 31, 2013.   Profit Sharing Account(t) = ITD Profit    Profit Share Account Increase(t) = Profit Sharing Account (t) - Profit Sharing Account (t-1)   Current  Year  Gross  Earned  Premiums  =  Gross  Earned  Premiums(t)  =  GEP(t)  =  ITD  Gross  Earned  Premiums(t) - ITD Gross Earned Premiums(t-1)   ITD Margin = ITD Profit / ITD GEP   If ITD Margin &gt;= [***] THEN         ITD Profit Sharing = [(ITD Margin - [***]) * [***] + [***]] * ITD GEP   If ITD Margin &gt;= [***] AND ITD Margin &lt; [***] THEN          ITD Profit Sharing = (ITD Margin - [***]) * ITD GEP    HFD 224573.6  </FONT></DIV>

Commission True-up   Once annually, the Administrator will calculate the average paid commission rate paid to Administrator&#8217;s  distribution sources.      Average Commission Rate to Distributors = Commission Paid to Distributors / Collected Commissionable  Premium   Provisional Commission Rate = Provisional Commission Amounts Paid / Gross Written Commissionable  Premiums   Commissions Paid to Distributors is defined as the agreed percentage of premium paid to producers for the  placement of Company business plus any promotions, giveaways, incentive related programs, and out-of- pocket retail producer expenses designed to increase production of Company products.    If Average Commission Rate + [***] is less than Provision Commission Rate Administrator will return an  amount to the Company equal to (Provisional Commission - Average Commission Rate - [***]) * Gross Written  Commissionable Premiums.     For each calendar year this Agreement is in effect, Administrator shall not spend in excess of the Provisional  Commission Rate less [***] without prior written approval from Company.   The Commission True-up Payment from Administrator to Company or from Company to Administrator will  take place simultaneously with any Profit Sharing Payment to Administrator such that the Profit Sharing  payment  will  be  decreased,  if  necessary.   If  there  is  no  Profit  Sharing  payment  due  to  Administrator,  Administrator shall make the Commission True-up Payment on or about April 1st of each year.

Buy-Down Layer Cost is     equal to the cost of placing Buy-Down Layer for ONLY business covered under this agreement.  If the     Buy-Down Layer is not purchased by Company, then the Buy-Down Layer Cost is equal to [***] times     modeled AAL at September 30 of the respective year.           Shared Corporate Layer for the 2013 catastrophe year attaches at $7 million and exhausts at 100-year     Return Period PML. The Shared Corporate Layer for 2014 catastrophe year and beyond will attach at     the level of Company&#8217;s corporate catastrophe reinsurance purchase and exhaust at the 100-year Return     Period PML (this amount may be increased if required by regulatory or Demotech requirements). The     Shared Corporate Layer Cost will be calculated using the Company&#8217;s AIR / RMS average AAL for each     reinsurance layer purchased times Administrator program AIR / RMS average AAL at September 30.      Parties will mutually agree on reasonable estimate of AIR / RMS average AAL multiples for layers that     are only partially covered by Shared Corporate Layer.         Given that Company reinsurance program incepts at July 1 of each year, 6/12 of costs in this section     are from current catastrophe year and 6/12 from prior catastrophe year.  For example, 2014 calendar     year costs for this calculation are based on 1/2 of 2013 catastrophe year costs and 1/2 of 2014     catastrophe year costs.      b) Costs incurred for the Calendar Year in the purchase of Per Risk Reinsurance including XOL Treaty,     Facultative, ID Theft and any other Reinsurance.  For example, if the treaty incepts on July 1 of the     year, the Calendar Year charge is 6/12 of the cost of the cost of the treaty incepting on July 1 of the     preceding year and 6/12 of the cost of the treaty incepting in the current Calendar Year.    c) Ceded earned premium incurred in the purchase of Quota Share Reinsurance for the policies in this     agreement.

Commissionable premiums are exclusive of Surcharges and policy fees. Should this agreement terminate  for any reason Administrator agrees to return to the Company all Commission on those policies that are  canceled in a fashion consistent with monthly bordereaux statements.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">D. Profit Sharing  The Administrator will earn a profit sharing payment annually based on performance.  Company will provide  Administrator with any financial information needed to calculate profit sharing no later than March 1 of each  year. This information includes, but is not limited to, actual loss amounts paid and case reserves, actual  reinsurance costs and associated allocation calculations and premium taxes.   The intent of the profit sharing arrangement is to establish a sharing of the inception to date profits generated  under this Agreement. The parties agree that if the profit margin (defined based on ITD Profit divided by ITD  Gross Earned Premium) is greater than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the margin over [***]  of the gross profit. Over the cumulative term of this Agreement, if the profit margin is greater than [***] but  less than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin. If the profit margin is greater than  [***] and less than [***], the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin in excess of [***]. If the profit  margin is less than [***], there is no profit sharing.   The following describes in terms of mathematical expressions the approach to the computation over the life  of this Agreement.     Profit sharing payments shall be based on the calculation set forth below.   Profit Sharing Calculations   &#8220;ITD&#8221; means Inception-to-Date for all revenues subject to this Agreement, which shall include all premiums,  policy fees, inspection fees, setup fees and installment fees on payment plans collected on business written  pursuant to this Agreement.  For the purposes of all calculations, Inception-to-Date refers to measurements  for the period starting July 1, 2013 through the latest measurement period for all revenues subject to this  Agreement.  For example, ITD Gross Earned Premium (or ITD GEP) for the year-end 2014 profit sharing  calculations, as calculated in early 2015, is the total Gross Earned Premium for the periods from July 1, 2013  through December 31, 2014 and would be defined as ITD GEP or ITD GEP(t).  For the same measurement  date in early 2015, ITD GEP(t-1) is defined as the inception-to-date GEP as of the prior year from July 1,  2013 through December 31, 2013.  The first measurement period will be for 2013 based on the period from  inception through December 31, 2013.   Profit Sharing Account(t) = ITD Profit    Profit Share Account Increase(t) = Profit Sharing Account (t) - Profit Sharing Account (t-1)   Current  Year  Gross  Earned  Premiums  =  Gross  Earned  Premiums(t)  =  GEP(t)  =  ITD  Gross  Earned  Premiums(t) - ITD Gross Earned Premiums(t-1)   ITD Margin = ITD Profit / ITD GEP   If ITD Margin &gt;= [***] THEN         ITD Profit Sharing = [(ITD Margin - [***]) * [***] + [***]] * ITD GEP   If ITD Margin &gt;= [***] AND ITD Margin &lt; [***] THEN          ITD Profit Sharing = (ITD Margin - [***]) * ITD GEP    3 </FONT></DIV>

Commission True-up   Once annually, the Administrator will calculate the average paid commission rate paid to Administrator&#8217;s  distribution sources.      Average Commission Rate to Distributors = Commission Paid to Distributors / Collected Commissionable  Premium   Provisional Commission Rate = Provisional Commission Amounts Paid / Gross Written Commissionable  Premiums   Commissions Paid to Distributors is defined as the agreed percentage of premium paid to producers for the  placement of Company business plus any promotions, giveaways, incentive related programs, and out-of- pocket retail producer expenses designed to increase production of Company products.    If Average Commission Rate + [***] is less than Provision Commission Rate Administrator will return an  amount to the Company equal to (Provisional Commission - Average Commission Rate - [***]) * Gross Written  Commissionable Premiums.     For each calendar year this Agreement is in effect, Administrator shall not spend in excess of the Provisional  Commission Rate less [***] without prior written approval from Company.   The Commission True-up Payment from Administrator to Company or from Company to Administrator will  take place simultaneously with any Profit Sharing Payment to Administrator such that the Profit Sharing  payment  will  be  decreased,  if  necessary.   If  there  is  no  Profit  Sharing  payment  due  to  Administrator,  Administrator shall make the Commission True-up Payment on or about April 1st of each year.   For periods prior to but not including 2015, the Commission True-up Payment is deemed to be not applicable  in the calculation of any and all profit share payments, earnings or account adjustments.

Buy-Down Layer Cost is     equal to the cost of placing Buy-Down Layer for ONLY business covered under this agreement.  If the     Buy-Down Layer is not purchased by Company, then the Buy-Down Layer Cost is equal to [***] times     modeled AAL at September 30 of the respective year.           Shared Corporate Layer for the 2013 catastrophe year attaches at $7 million and exhausts at 100-year     Return Period PML. The Shared Corporate Layer for 2014 catastrophe year and beyond will attach at     the level of Company&#8217;s corporate catastrophe reinsurance purchase and exhaust at the 100-year Return     Period PML (this amount may be increased if required by regulatory or Demotech requirements). The     Shared Corporate Layer Cost will be calculated using the Company&#8217;s AIR / RMS average AAL for each     reinsurance layer purchased times Administrator program AIR / RMS average AAL at September 30.      Parties will mutually agree on reasonable estimate of AIR / RMS average AAL multiples for layers that     are only partially covered by Shared Corporate Layer.         Given that Company reinsurance program incepts at July 1 of each year, 6/12 of costs in this section     are from current catastrophe year and 6/12 from prior catastrophe year.  For example, 2014 calendar     year costs for this calculation are based on 1/2 of 2013 catastrophe year costs and 1/2 of 2014     catastrophe year costs.      b) Costs incurred for the Calendar Year in the purchase of Per Risk Reinsurance including XOL Treaty,     Facultative, ID Theft and any other Reinsurance.  For example, if the treaty incepts on July 1 of the     year, the Calendar Year charge is 6/12 of the cost of the cost of the treaty incepting on July 1 of the     preceding year and 6/12 of the cost of the treaty incepting in the current Calendar Year.    c) Ceded earned premium incurred in the purchase of Quota Share Reinsurance for the policies in this     agreement. For example, if the treaty incepts on July 1 of the year, the Calendar Year charge is 6/12 of    5 </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">The Administrator will collect setup fees and installment fees allowable under applicable state law on payment  plans  in  exchange  for  coverage  costs  of  bank  accounts, credit  card  fees,  ACH  fees  and  lockbox  fees  associated with this Agreement.   D.    Profit Sharing   The Administrator will earn a profit sharing payment annually based on performance. Company will provide  Administrator with any financial information needed to calculation profit sharing no later than March 1 of each  year (the &#8220;Annual Profit Calculation&#8221;). This information includes, but is not limited to, actual loss amounts paid  and case reserves, actual reinsurance costs and associated allocation calculations and premium taxes. Profit  Sharing will be paid by Company to Administrator within 15 days of receipt from Administrator of annual Profit  Sharing calculations (to be provided on or about March 15) (the &#8220;Profit Share Payment Date&#8221;).   The intent of the profit sharing arrangement is to establish a sharing of the inception to date profits (&#8220;ITD  Profits&#8221;) generated under this Agreement. The parties agree that if the profit margin (defined based on ITD  Profit divided by ITD Earned Premium) is greater than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the  margin over [***] of the gross profit. Over the cumulative term of this Agreement, if the margin is greater than  [***] but less than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin. If the margin is greater  than [***] and less than [***], the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin in excess of [***]. If the  profit margin is less than [***], there is no profit sharing.   FUNDING ACCOUNT   Commencing with calendar year 2017, the Administrator will establish a funding account for the benefit of  the Company (the Funding Account). The Funding Account will be available for the Administrator to return  excess  profit  sharing  to  the  Company  in  the  event  the  gross  profit  sharing  payments  made  to  the  Administrator since inception of the Agreement exceed the ITD Profits (such amounts referred to as an  &#8220;Excess Profit Share&#8221;). Initially, the Administrator will deposit $2,500,000 into the Funding Account, and the  parties  will  determine  annually following  the  Profit  Share  Payment  Date  if  additional  funds  need  to  be  deposited into the Funding Account, or if the amount required should be reduced (e.g., the Funding Account  will never have funds in excess of the ITD Profits). If the Annual Profit Calculation shows that the Administrator  has received any Excess Profit Share, then the Administrator shall return such Excess Profit Share to the  Company from the Funding Account.   If the Funding Account is insufficient to return the full amount of the Excess Profit Share, then the parties will  negotiate in good faith to establish a reasonable timeframe for the Administrator to return the outstanding  amount of the Excess Profit Share to the Company. In no event will the Annual Profit Calculation result in the  Administrator owing more than the ITD Profits received by Administrator to the Company.   The following describes in terms of mathematical expressions the approach to the computation over the life  of this Agreement.   Profit sharing payments shall be based on the calculation set forth below.   Profit Sharing Calculations                                                                                   </FONT></DIV>

For the purposes of all calculations, Inception-to-Date refers to measurements  for the period starting July 1, 2013 through the latest measurement period for all revenues subject to this  Agreement. For example, ITD Gross Earned Premium (or ITD GEP) for the year-end 2014 profit sharing  calculations, as calculated in early 2015, is the total Gross Earned Premium for the periods from July 1, 2013  through December 31, 2014 and would be defined as ITD GEP or ITD GEP(t). For the same measurement  date in early 2015, ITD GEP(t-1) is defined as the inception-to-date GEP as of the prior year from July 1,  2013 through December 31, 2013.

Commission True-up   Once annually, the Administrator will calculate the average paid commission rate paid to Administrator's  distribution sources.   Average Commission Rate to Distributors = Commission Paid to Distributors / Collected Commissionable  Premium   Provisional Commission Rate = Provisional Commission Amounts Paid / Gross Written Commissionable  Premiums                                                                                   </FONT></DIV>

If Average Commission Rate + [***] is less than Provision Commission Rate Administrator will return an  amount to the Company equal to (Provisional Commission - Average Commission Rate - [***]) * Gross Written  Cornmissionable Premiums.   For each calendar year this Agreement is in effect, Administrator shall not spend in excess of the Provisional  Commission Rate less [***] without prior written approval from Company.   The Commission True-up Payment from Administrator to Company or from Company to Administrator will  take place simultaneously with any Profit Sharing Payment to Administrator such that the Profit Sharing  payment  will  be  decreased,  if  necessary.  If  there  is  no  Profit  Sharing  payment  due  to  Administrator,  Administrator shall make the Commission True-up Payment on or about April 1st of each year.

Buy-Down Layer Cost is equal to the  cost of placing Buy-Down Layer for ONLY business covered under this agreement. If the Buy-Down Layer is  not purchased by Company, then the Buy-Down Layer Cost is equal to [***] times modeled AAL at September  30 of the respective year.   Shared Corporate Layer for the 2013 catastrophe year attaches at $7 million and exhausts at 100-year Return  Period PML, The Shared Corporate Layer for 2014 catastrophe year and beyond will attach at the level of  Company's corporate catastrophe reinsurance purchase and exhaust at the 100-year Return Period PML  (this amount may be increased if required by regulatory or Demotech requirements). The Shared Corporate  Layer Cost will be calculated using the Company's AIR / RMS average AAL for each reinsurance layer  purchased times Administrator program AIR / RMS average AAL at September 30. Parties will mutually agree  on reasonable estimate of AIR / RMS average AAL multiples for layers that are only partially covered by  Shared Corporate Layer.   Given that Company reinsurance program incepts at July 1 of each year, 6/12 of costs in this section are  from current catastrophe year and 6/12 from prior catastrophe year. For example, 2014 calendar year costs  for this calculation are based on 1/2 of 2013 catastrophe year costs and 1/2 of 2014 catastrophe year costs.   b) Costs incurred for the Calendar Year in the purchase of Per Risk Reinsurance including XOL Treaty,     Facultative, ID Theft and any other Reinsurance. For example, if the treaty incepts on July 1 of the     year, the Calendar Year charge is 6/12 of the cost of the cost of the treaty incepting on July 1 of the     preceding year and 6/12 of the cost of the treaty incepting in the current Calendar Year.       c) Ceded earned premium incurred in the purchase of Quota Share Reinsurance for the policies in this     agreement. For example, if the treaty incepts on July 1 of the year, the Calendar Year charge is 6/12 of     the cost of the treaty incepting on July 1 of the preceding year and 6/12 of the cost of the treaty incepting     in the current Calendar Year.          d) Calendar Year Incurred Losses and ALAE (including the benefit of subrogation).                                                                                  </FONT></DIV>

These  fees  are  intended  to  cover  Administrator Program Vendor Expenses  which  are outlined  in  General  Definitions  of  the  Profit  Sharing  Calculations Section of this Exhibit B.    C.    Setup Fees and Installment Fees on Payment Plans    The Administrator will collect setup fees and installment fees allowable under applicable state law on payment  plans  in  exchange  for  coverage  costs  of  bank  accounts,  credit  card  fees,  ACH  fees  and  lockbox  fees  associated with this Agreement. These costs are inclusive of Administrator Program Vendor Expenses which  are outlined in General Definitions of the Profit Sharing Calculations section of this Exhibit B.    D.    Commission True-up    Once annually, the Administrator will calculate the average paid commission rate paid to Administrator's  distribution sources.    Average Commission Rate to Distributors = (Commission Paid to Distributors / Collected Commissionable  Premium) + (Channels-Specific Retail Contingents Paid / Gross Written Commissionable Premiums)    Provisional Commission Rate = Provisional Commission Amounts Paid / Gross Written Commissionable  Premiums    Commissions Paid to Distributors is defined as the agreed percentage of premium paid to producers for the  placement of Company business plus any promotions, giveaways, incentive related programs (excluding  Channels-Specific Retail Contingents Paid), and out-of&#8226;pocket retail producer expenses designed to increase  production of Company products.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">Company recognizes that Administrator may enter into Channel-Specific Retail Contingent agreements with  large distributors designed to expand Company business. To the extent that those agreements are based on  earned premium, a provisional rate based on the Channel-Specific Retail Contingent contract may be applied  to that Channel-Specific unearned premium reserve for the Company and added to the amounts paid in  determining  the  total  Channels-Specific  Retail  Contingents  Paid  to  a  distributor  in  each  period.  These  Channels-Specific Retail Contingents Paid will be calculated as percent of Gross Written Commissionable  Premiums and added to Average Commission Rate    If Average Commission Rate + [***] is less than Provision Commission Rate, Administrator will return an  amount to the Company equal to (Provisional Commission - Average Commission Rate - [***]) * Gross Earned  Commissionable Premiums (&#8220;Commission Giveback&#8221;). If Average Commission Rate + [***] is more than the  Provisional Commission Rate, than Company will return to the Administrator an amount equal to (Average  Commission  Rate  +[***] - Provisional  Commission)  *  Gross  Earned  Commissionable  Premiums  (&#8220;Commission Shortfall&#8221;).    The  Commission  Giveback  from  Administrator  to  Company  or Commission  Shortfall  from  Company  to  Administrator will take place simultaneously with any Profit Sharing Payment to Administrator such that the  Profit  Sharing  payment  will  be  decreased,  if  necessary.  If  there  is  no  Profit  Sharing  payment  due  to  Administrator, Administrator or Company shall make the Commission True-up Payment on or about October  1st of each year. Administrator collection of Program Fees more or less than Administrator incurred Program  Vendor Expenses shall also be taken into consideration when making this Commission True-up Payment, to  increase or decrease accordingly in the event of no Profit Sharing Payment.    For all policies incepting before September 1, 2015, the Commission True-up Payment is deemed to be not  applicable in the calculation of any and all profit share payments, earnings or account adjustments.    E.    Profit Sharing  The Administrator will earn a profit sharing payment annually based on performance. Company will provide  Administrator with any financial information needed to calculate profit sharing no later than July 15th of each  year (the &#8220;Annual Profit Calculation&#8221;). This information includes, but is not limited to, actual loss amounts paid  and case reserves, actual reinsurance costs and associated allocation calculations and premium taxes. Profit  Sharing will be paid by Company to Administrator within 15 days of receipt from Administrator of annual Profit  Sharing calculations (to be provided on or about July 31) (the &#8220;Profit Share Payment Date&#8221;).

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  The intent of the profit sharing arrangement is to establish a sharing of the inception to date profits (&#8220;ITD  Profits&#8221;) generated under this Agreement. The parties agree that if the profit margin (defined based on ITD  Profit divided by ITD Earned Premium) is greater than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the  margin over [***] of the gross profit. Over the cumulative term of this Agreement, if the margin is greater than  [***] but less than [***], then the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin. If the margin is greater  than [***] and less than [***], the Administrator is entitled to [***] of the profit margin in excess of [***]. If the  profit margin is less than [***], there is no profit sharing.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Administrator shall not be entitled to receive any payment  of  profit  share  hereunder  during  any  &#8220;Treaty  Year&#8221;  (as  defined  below)  in  which  the  Company  incurs  a  catastrophe loss or losses in any state where business is written pursuant to this Agreement unless and until  Administrator has satisfied its obligations to return to Company any Excess Profit Share as set forth below.    Profit Sharing Calculations    The following describes in terms of mathematical expressions the approach to the computation over the life  of this Agreement.    Profit sharing payments shall be based on the calculation set forth below.    &#8220;ITD&#8221; means Inception-to-Date for all revenues subject to this Agreement, which shall include all premiums,  policy fees, inspection fees, setup fees and installment fees on payment plans collected on business written  pursuant to this Agreement. For the purposes of all calculations, Inception-to-Date refers to measurements  for the period starting July 1, 2013 through the latest measurement period for all revenues subject to this  Agreement. For example, ITD Gross Earned Premium (or ITD GEP) for the year-end 2014 profit sharing  calculations, as calculated in early 2015, is the total Gross Earned Premium for the periods from July 1, 2013  through December 31, 2014 and would be defined as ITD GEP or ITD GEP(t). For the same measurement  date in early 2015, ITD GEP(t-1) is defined as the inception-to-date GEP as of the prior year from July 1,  2013 through December 31, 2013. The first measurement period will be for 2013 based on the period from  inception through December 31, 2013.

The Funded Amount will be available for the Administrator to return excess profit sharing to the Company in  the event the gross profit-sharing payments made to the Administrator since inception of the Agreement  exceed the ITD Profits (such amounts referred to as an &#8220;Excess Profit Share&#8221;). If the Annual Profit Calculation  shows that the Administrator has received any Excess Profit Share, then the Administrator shall return such  Excess Profit Share to the Company from the Funding Account.    If in any year the Funded Amount is insufficient to return the full amount of the Excess Profit Share, then the  parties will negotiate in good faith to establish a reasonable timeframe for the Administrator to return the  outstanding amount of the Excess Profit Share to the Company, no later than December 31 of the applicable  year.  In  the  event  that  the  Administrator  does  not  return  the  full  amount  of  the  Excess  Profit  Share  by  December 31 of the applicable year, the Company may, in its sole discretion, offset and withhold payment of  commissions due to Administrator under Paragraph A of Exhibit B attached to this amendment (in an amount  not to exceed 3% of Written Premium per month) and/or offset and withhold any profit sharing payments due  to Administrator pursuant to Paragraph E of Exhibit B, in an amount equal to the Excess Profit Share not  returned to Company by Administrator.
