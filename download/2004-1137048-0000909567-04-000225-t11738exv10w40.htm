this Section&nbsp;8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters severally
agree to contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending same) (collectively &#147;Losses&#148;) to which the Company
and one or more of the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one
hand and by the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Securities;
<I>provided, however</I>, that in no case shall any Underwriter (except as may be
provided in any agreement among underwriters relating to the offering of the
Securities) be responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting
discount or commission applicable to the Securities purchased by such
Underwriter hereunder. If the allocation provided by the immediately preceding
sentence is unavailable for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters
severally shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the
one hand and of the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements
or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall be deemed to
be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
expenses) received by it, and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be
deemed to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each
case as set forth on the cover page of the Final Prospectus. Relative fault
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any untrue or
any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information provided by the
Company on the one hand or the Underwriters on the other, and the relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission. The Company and the Underwriters agree that it
would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata
allocation or any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this paragraph (d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

the Representatives shall determine in order that the required changes in the

identified to their satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company,
certificates of public officials, officers of the Company and other persons,

the authenticity of all documents submitted to them as originals and the
conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to them as copies. In
rendering the opinions expressed below, such counsel has relied as to factual
matters, to the extent such counsel deemed proper, upon the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement,
certificates of officers of the Company and certificates of public officials.
Such counsel has also reviewed and participated in discussions concerning the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus (in each
case other than the documents incorporated by reference therein) with certain
officers or employees of the Company and its auditors, and with representatives
of and counsel to the Underwriters. The limitations inherent in the

are such, however, that such counsel cannot and does not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any of the
statements made in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, except

simultaneously with his opinion:
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such counsel has examined this Agreement and the originals, or copies
identified to their satisfaction, of such corporate records of the Company,
certificates of public officials, officers of the Company and other persons,
and such other documents, agreements and instruments as such counsel deemed
necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In
their examinations, such counsel has assumed the genuineness of all signatures,
the authenticity of all documents submitted to them as originals and the
conformity with the originals of all documents submitted to them as copies. In
rendering the opinions expressed below, such counsel has relied as to factual
matters, to the extent such counsel deemed proper, upon the representations and
warranties of the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement,
certificates of officers of the Company and certificates of public officials.
Such counsel has also reviewed and participated in discussions concerning the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus with certain
officers or employees of the Company and its auditors, and with representatives
of and counsel to the Underwriters. The limitations inherent in the
independent verification of factual matters and in the role of general counsel
are such, however, that such counsel cannot and does not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any of the
statements made in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, except
as set forth in paragraph (vii)&nbsp;of such counsel&#146;s opinion letter addressed to
you, dated the date hereof.
</FONT>
<P align="left"><FONT size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the limitations set forth in the immediately preceding
paragraph, such counsel advises you that, on the basis of the information such
counsel gained in the course of performing the services referred to above, (i)
in such counsel&#146;s opinion, the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus
(other than the financial statements, related schedules and other financial or
statistical data contained therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such
counsel has not been requested to comment) appear on their face to be
appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of the
Securities Act and the applicable rules and regulations of the Commission
thereunder; and (ii)&nbsp;no facts came to such counsel&#146;s attention which gave him
reason to believe that (a)&nbsp;the Registration Statement (other than the financial
statements, related schedules and other financial or statistical data contained
therein or omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel has not been requested
to comment) at the time the Registration Statement became effective, contained
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (b)&nbsp;the Final Prospectus (other than the financial statements,
related schedules and other financial or statistical data contained therein or
omitted therefrom, as to which such counsel has not been requested to comment),
as of its date or the date hereof, contained or contains an untrue statement of
a material fact or omitted or omits to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.
