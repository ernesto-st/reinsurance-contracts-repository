</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Securities Purchase Agreement (this &#147;Agreement&#148;) is made as of the 11<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">th</SUP> day
of May, 2005, by and among the purchaser listed on Schedule&nbsp;A attached hereto (the &#147;Purchaser&#148;) and
Specialty Underwriters&#146; Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company desires to sell to Purchaser certain shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;B
Common Stock, par value $.01 per share (the &#147;Shares&#148;),
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and the mutual covenants, agreements
and other consideration set forth herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby,
agree as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt">1. <U>Sale and Purchase of Securities; Closing</U>.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Authorization</U>. The Company has authorized the issuance and sale of the Shares,
having the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions set forth in the Company&#146;s Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Schedule&nbsp;B (the
&#147;Certificate of Incorporation&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Sale and Purchase</U>. Subject to the terms, conditions, representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the
Company, and the Company agrees to sell, assign, transfer and deliver to the Purchaser, from time
to time, as set forth herein, the applicable number of Shares for the consideration specified in
Section&nbsp;1(c).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Purchase Price</U>. The Purchaser agrees to pay to the Company an aggregate purchase
price of $1,000,000 (the &#147;Purchase Price&#148;) to purchase Shares in installment payments in the
following manner: (i) $25,000 on August&nbsp;1, 2005; (ii)&nbsp;thereafter, on a monthly basis, 25% of the
commissions owed to Purchaser by the Company on the last day of each month, in accordance with the
Partner Agent Program Agreement, attached hereto as Schedule&nbsp;C; and (iii)&nbsp;on the second anniversary
of the effective date of this Agreement, a balloon payment for the remaining unpaid balance of the
$1,000,000 (each date individually, an &#147;Installment Date&#148;). The number of Shares that Purchaser
will receive in consideration for such payments will be determined by dividing (i)&nbsp;the applicable
portion of the purchase price due on each Installment Date (each individually, a &#147;Payment&#148;) by (ii)
the Closing Price of the Company&#146;s Common Stock on each Installment Date, or if such day is not a
Trading Day, the Trading Day first preceding the scheduled Installment Date (with fractional Shares
rounded up to the next whole Share). If Purchaser fails to make full payment on any Installment
Date, the number of Shares that Purchaser shall be entitled to receive, with respect to such
Installment Date, will be equal to the Payment divided by the Closing Price of the Common Stock on
the Installment Date, or if such day is not a Trading Day, the Trading Day first preceding the
scheduled Installment Date. Each Payment shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available
funds to an account designated by the Company.

anniversary of the date of that certain Partner Agent Program Agreement between the Company and the
Purchaser (the &#147;Partner Agent Agreement&#148;), provided that the Partner Agent Agreement is still in
effect and has not been terminated by either party thereto, the Purchaser shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to exchange its shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock for an equal number of shares of Common
Stock (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split,
combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other similar event involving a
change in such security); provided, further, that after the fifth anniversary of the date of the
Partner Agent Agreement and for so long as the Partner Agent Agreement is in effect, including any
day or days on which the Purchaser exercises such exchange right, the Purchaser must retain legal
and beneficial ownership for its own benefit of such number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock as could be
exchanged for the same number of shares of Common Stock with a value on such date of $500,000, as
determined pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(g).

certificate or certificates for the shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock to be so exchanged, accompanied by
written notice of exchange duly executed, to the Company at any time during regular business hours
at the office of the Company. If so required by the Company, the shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock so
exchanged shall be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the Purchaser.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;<U>Issuance of Shares on Exchange</U>. (i)&nbsp;As promptly as practicable after the
surrender, as provided herein, of any shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock for exchange, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser certificates representing the number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock have been exchanged in accordance
with the provisions of Section&nbsp;4(c)(i). Such exchange shall be deemed to have been made as of the
close of business on the date that such shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock shall have been surrendered for
exchange by delivery thereof with a written notice of exchange duly executed, so that the rights of
the Purchaser as a holder of the shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock so exchanged shall cease at such time and,
subject to the following provisions of this section, the Purchaser shall be treated for all
purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Common Stock at such time; provided,
however, that no such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed shall be effective to constitute the Purchaser as the record holder of such shares of Common
Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Purchaser as the record
holder thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next succeeding day on which such
stock transfer books are open. The Company shall issue and deliver to the Purchaser, at the
expense of the Company, a new certificate covering the number of shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock
representing the unexchanged portion of the certificate so surrendered, which new certificate shall
entitle in all respects the Purchaser to the rights of the Class&nbsp;B Stock represented thereby to the
same extent as if the certificate theretofore covering such unexchanged shares had not been
surrendered for exchange.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;All shares of Class&nbsp;B Stock that shall have been surrendered for exchange as provided
herein shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares shall
immediately cease and terminate on the surrender date, except only the right of the Purchaser to
receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, and such shares shall not thereafter be transferred on the books of the Company or be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose whatsoever.

execution of the Partner Agent Agreement, if the Partner Agent Agreement is terminated by either
the Company or the Purchaser, for any reason, the Company shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to repurchase the Shares currently held by the Purchaser for a price per Share equal to
the lesser of (1)&nbsp;the weighted average purchase price per Share as provided herein or (2)&nbsp;the
Current Market Price (as defined herein) of the Common Stock; and (B)&nbsp;at any time on or after the

right, but not the obligation, to repurchase the Shares currently held by the Purchaser for a price
per Share equal to the Current Market Price of the Common Stock. Such right of the Company may be
exercised by providing a notice of repurchase (the &#147;Repurchase Notice&#148;) to the Purchaser not less
than five business days prior to the date repurchase is to be made pursuant to this Section&nbsp;4(e),

defined herein) preceding such date (subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
similar event involving a change in such security); provided, however, that in the case of the
Common Stock, where no public market exists for the Common Stock at the time of exchange, the
Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock shall be as determined by an independent
investment banking firm experienced in the valuation of securities of property and casualty
insurance companies and selected by the Company (at the Company&#146;s expense); provided that, after
receipt of the determination by such firm, the Purchaser shall have the right to select (at the
expense of the Purchaser) a second such investment banking firm to make such determination, in
which case the Current Market Price shall be the average of the two determinations; and provided
further that such determination need not be made more frequently than once every six months and any
determination shall be superceded by a good faith determination by the Company&#146;s board of directors
that shall be required if a material event reasonably likely to affect the value of the Common
Stock (such as a placement of equity securities) should occur after the next preceding
determination, whether by an investment banking firm or firms, or by the Company&#146;s board of
directors.

registration available. The Purchaser understands that the Shares, and any shares of Common Stock
