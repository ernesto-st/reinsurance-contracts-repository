        (f) Section 2.08(a) of the Agreement is amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

               SECTION 2.08. Fees. (a) Facility Fee. The Borrowers agree to
        pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders a
        facility fee (i) from and including the Effective Date to but not
        including the Termination Date at the rate of the Applicable
        Facility Fee Percentage on the average daily WC Commitment of each
        Lender (whether used or unused) and (ii) from and including the

        equal to the sum of 0.15% plus the Applicable Facility Fee
        Percentage on the average daily aggregate outstanding principal
        amount of the Advances of each Lender; provided, however, that no
        facility fee shall accrue on the Unused WC Commitment of a
        Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting
        Lender. Accrued facility fees shall be payable in arrears quarterly
        on the last day of each March, June, September and December,
        commencing on June 30, 2001, on the Termination Date and, if later,

phrase "and the date of the Initial Extension of Credit" in the last
sentence of the subsection.

        (i) The form of Competitive Bid Note, Exhibit A-2, in the Agreement
is replaced by Exhibit A-2 attached hereto.

        SECTION 3. Change in Commitments. With effect from and including
the date this Amendment and Restatement becomes effective in accordance
with Section 8 hereof, (i) each Person listed on the signature pages hereof
which is not a party to the Agreement (a "New Lender") shall become a
Lender party to the Agreement and (ii) the Commitment of each Lender shall
be the amount set forth opposite the name of such Lender on the attached
Commitment Schedule, which shall replace the existing Commitment Schedule.
Any Lender whose Commitment is changed to zero shall upon such
effectiveness cease to be a Lender party to the Agreement, and all accrued
fees and other amounts payable under the Agreement for the account of such
Lender shall be due and payable on such date; provided that the provisions
of Sections 2.12, 8.05 and 9.03 of the Agreement shall continue to inure to
the benefit of each such Lender.

        forth in the Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment and

        and as of such date.

        (b) The Parent hereby represents and warrants that, as of the date

Restatement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which

become effective as of the date hereof when each of the following

               for each of the New Lenders and each Lender with a
               Commitment (as reflected on the existing Commitment
               Schedule) which differs from the Commitment reflected on the
               attached Commitment Schedule, dated on or before the date of
               effectiveness hereof (the "New Notes").

Agreement.

        The Obligor hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice
of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights
hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of
such rights.
