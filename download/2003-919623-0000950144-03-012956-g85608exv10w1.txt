(a) At any time (i) after the occurrence and during the continuance of any

pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15 or this Section the Administrative Agent shall,
demand that each Revolving Dollar Lender pay in Dollars to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the Foreign Currency Lenders, in the manner provided
in clause (b) below, such Revolving Dollar Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the
Dollar Equivalent (utilizing, with respect to each Foreign Currency Loan, the
Exchange Rate at the time such Foreign Currency Loan was borrowed) of the
Aggregate Foreign Currency Exposure and related accrued but unpaid interest at
such time, which demand shall be made through the Administrative Agent, shall be
in writing and shall specify the outstanding principal amount and interest of
Foreign Currency Loans.

                  (b)      Each demand referred to in clause (a) above shall be
delivered to each Revolving Dollar Lender, together with a statement prepared by
the Administrative Agent setting forth in reasonable detail the Aggregate
Foreign Currency Exposure and Dollar Equivalent thereof (utilizing, with respect
to each Foreign Currency Loan, the Exchange Rate at the time such Foreign
Currency Loan was borrowed), and whether or not the conditions set forth in
Section 4.03 or 2.01(a) shall be satisfied (which conditions the Revolving
Lenders hereby irrevocably waive), each Revolving Dollar Lender shall, before
11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day next succeeding the date of such
Revolving Dollar Lender's receipt of such demand, make available to the
Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds in Dollars for the account

Equivalent (utilizing, with respect to each Foreign Currency Loan, the Exchange
Rate at the time such Foreign Currency Loan was borrowed) of the Aggregate
Foreign Currency Exposure and related accrued but unpaid interest at such time
(with respect to each such Revolving Dollar Lender, its "Dollar Portion"). Upon
such payment by a Revolving Dollar Lender, such Revolving Dollar Lender shall,
except as provided in clause (c) below, be deemed to have made a Revolving
Dollar Loan to the Borrower in the principal amount of such payment and bearing
interest at the Alternate Base Rate. The Administrative Agent shall forward such
payments by the Revolving Dollar Lenders (or cause such payments to be
forwarded) to the Foreign Currency Lenders according to their respective Foreign
Currency Sublimits. To the extent that any Revolving Dollar Lender fails to make
its Dollar Portion available to the Administrative Agent for the accounts of the
Foreign Currency Lenders, the Borrower agrees to pay such Dollar Portion on
demand in immediately available funds in Dollars for the benefit of the Foreign
Currency Lenders (as payment for the Foreign Currency Loans). As of the date of
any such demand, the Foreign Currency Loans (together with any interest then
accrued thereon) shall, immediately and without further action, become due and
payable and, to the extent not otherwise repaid hereunder, the Borrower agrees,
as a separate and independent obligation, to pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of any Foreign Currency Lender entitled thereto, any amounts to
which any Foreign Currency Lender may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.18 or
Section 10.19 and which shall not otherwise have been repaid by the Revolving
Dollar Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.04.

                  (c)      Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under
Section 7.01(i), the Foreign Currency Loans shall automatically, immediately,
and without notice of any kind, convert

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

to Revolving Dollar Loans (based upon the Dollar Equivalent of the Aggregate
Foreign Currency Exposure at the time of the occurrence of such Event
of Default) and bearing interest at the rate applicable to Revolving Dollar
Loans bearing interest based on the Alternate Base Rate, whereupon each
Revolving Dollar Lender shall acquire, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided participation in each Foreign Currency Loan otherwise required to be
repaid by such Revolving Dollar Lender pursuant to clause (b) above, which
participation shall be in a principal amount equal to such Revolving Dollar
Lender's Dollar Portion by paying to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of
the Foreign Currency Lenders on the date on which such Revolving Dollar Lender
would otherwise have been required to make a payment in respect of such Foreign
Currency Loan pursuant to clause (b) above, in immediately available funds in
Dollars, an amount equal to such Revolving Lender's Dollar Portion. If all or
part of such amount is not in fact made available by such Revolving Dollar
Lender to the Administrative Agent on such date, the Foreign Currency Lenders
shall be entitled to recover any such unpaid amount on demand from such
Revolving Dollar Lender together with interest accrued from such date at the
Alternate Base Rate. As of the date of any such Event of Default under Section
7.01(i), all Foreign Currency Loans (together with any interest then accrued
thereon) shall, immediately and without further action, become due and payable
and, to the extent not otherwise repaid hereunder, the Borrower agrees, as a
separate and independent obligation, to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of any Foreign Currency Lender entitled thereto, any amounts to which
any Foreign Currency Lender may be entitled to pursuant to Section 2.18 or
Section 10.19 and which shall not otherwise have been repaid by the Revolving
Dollar Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.04.

                  (d)      From and after the date on which any Revolving Lender
(i) is deemed to have made a Revolving Dollar Loan pursuant to clause (b) above
with respect to any Foreign Currency Loan or (ii) purchases an undivided
participation interest in a Foreign Currency Loan pursuant to clause (c) above,
the Administrative Agent and the Foreign Currency Lenders shall promptly
distribute to such Revolving Dollar Lender such Revolving Dollar Lender's Pro
Rata Percentage of all payments of principal amount and interest received by the
Administrative Agent or the Foreign Currency Lenders on account of such Foreign
Currency Loan in excess of those received pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above.

                  (e)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Revolving Dollar
Lender shall not have any obligation to acquire a participation in a Foreign
Currency Loan pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs if a Default or Event of
Default or Event of Termination shall have occurred and be continuing at the
time such Foreign Currency Loan was made and such Revolving Dollar Lender shall
have notified the Foreign Currency Lenders in writing prior to the time such
Foreign Currency Loan was made, that such Default or Event of Default or such
Event of Termination has occurred and that such Revolving Dollar Lender will not
acquire participations in Foreign Currency Loans made while such Default or
Event of Default or such Event of Termination is continuing.

                  SECTION 2.05. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the Swingline Lender agrees to make swingline loans
(individually, a "Swingline Loan" and collectively, the "Swingline Loans") to
the Borrower from time to time during the Revolving

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

Credit Commitment Period in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 2.05; provided that (i) the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline
Loans shall not exceed $15.0 million at any one time outstanding, (ii) the
principal amount of any Borrowing of Swingline Loans may not exceed the
aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Credit Commitments of all Revolving
Lenders immediately prior to such Borrowing or result in the Aggregate Revolving
Credit Exposure then outstanding exceeding the Total Revolving Credit
Commitments then in effect, and (iii) in no event may Swingline Loans be
borrowed hereunder if (x) a Default or Event of Default or Event of Termination
shall have occurred and be continuing and (y) such Default or Event of Default
or Event of Termination shall not have been subsequently cured or waived.
Amounts borrowed under this Section 2.05 may be repaid and, up to but excluding
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, reborrowed. All Swingline Loans shall at all
times be ABR Loans. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent notice of
any Swingline Loan requested hereunder (which notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the requested
Borrowing Date) specifying (A) the amount to be borrowed, and (B) the requested
Borrowing Date. Upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Swingline Lender of the aggregate amount of such Borrowing.
Not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in
such notice the Swingline Lender shall make such Swingline Loan available to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower at the office of the
Administrative Agent set forth in Section 10.01 in funds immediately available
to the Administrative Agent. Amounts so received by the Administrative Agent
will promptly be made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent
crediting the account of the Borrower on the books of such office with the
amount made available to the Administrative Agent by the Swingline Lender (or,
in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC
Disbursement as provided in Section 2.07(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank)
and in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent. Each Borrowing
pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall be in a minimum principal amount of $500,000
or an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default or Event of Termination or noncompliance with the conditions
precedent set forth in Article IV or the minimum borrowing amounts specified in
Section 2.02, if any Swingline Loan shall remain outstanding at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, on the seventh Business Day following the Borrowing Date thereof
and if by such time on such seventh Business Day the Administrative Agent shall
have received neither (i) a Borrowing Request delivered by the Borrower pursuant
to Section 2.02 requesting that Revolving Loans be made pursuant to Section 2.01
on the immediately succeeding Business Day in an amount at least equal to the
aggregate principal amount of such Swingline Loan, nor (ii) any other notice
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent indicating the Borrower's intent to
repay such Swingline Loan on the immediately succeeding Business Day with funds
obtained from other sources, the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have
received a Borrowing Request from the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.02
requesting that ABR Revolving Loans be made pursuant to Section 2.01 on such
immediately succeeding Business Day in an amount equal to the amount of such
Swingline Loan, and the procedures set forth in Section 2.02 shall be followed
in making such ABR Revolving Loans; provided that for the purposes of
determining each Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Percentage with respect to such
Borrowing, the Swingline Loan to be repaid with the proceeds of such Borrowing
shall be deemed to not

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

be outstanding. The proceeds of such ABR Revolving Loans shall be applied to
repay such Swingline Loan.

                  (c)      If, for any reason, ABR Revolving Loans may not be,
or are not, made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 2.05 to repay any
Swingline Loan as required by such paragraph, effective on the date such ABR
Revolving Loans would otherwise have been made, each Revolving Lender severally,
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees that it shall, without regard to the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, purchase a participating interest
in such Swingline Loan ("Unrefunded Swingline Loan") in an amount equal to such
Revolving Lender's Pro Rata Percentage of the aggregate amount of the ABR
Revolving Loans which would otherwise have been made pursuant to paragraph (b)
of this Section 2.05. Each Revolving Lender will immediately transfer to the
Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds, the amount of its
participation, and the proceeds of such participations shall be distributed by
the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender. All payments by the Revolving
Lenders in respect of Unrefunded Swingline Loans and participations therein
shall be made in accordance with Section 2.14.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Lender shall not
have any obligation to acquire a participation in a Swingline Loan pursuant to
the foregoing paragraphs if a Default or Event of Default or Event of
Termination shall have occurred and be continuing at the time such Swingline
Loan was made and such Lender shall have notified the Swingline Lender in
writing prior to the time such Swingline Loan was made, that such Default or
Event of Default or such Event of Termination has occurred and that such Lender
will not acquire participations in Swingline Loans made while such Default or
Event of Default or such Event of Termination is continuing.

                  SECTION 2.06. Optional and Mandatory Prepayments of Loans;
Repayments of Term B Loans. (a) The Borrower may at any time and from time to
time prepay the Loans (subject, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, to compliance
with the terms of Section 2.18), in whole or in part, subject to Section
2.06(e), upon irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, two Business Days prior to the date of such
prepayment, specifying (i) the date and amount of prepayment, and (ii) the Class
of Loans to be prepaid and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Loans, ABR
Loans or a combination thereof (including in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, the
Borrowing to which such prepayment is to be applied and, if of a combination
thereof, the amount allocable to each). Upon receipt of any such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any
such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to such
date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of Loans (other than Swingline
Loans) shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million, (pound)5.0
million or (euro)5.0 million, as applicable, or a whole multiple of $1.0
million, (pound)1.0 million or (euro)1.0 million, as applicable, in excess
thereof (or, if less, the remaining outstanding principal amount thereof).
Partial prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be in an aggregate principal amount
of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the
remaining outstanding principal amount thereof).

                                      -47-

<PAGE>

                  (b)      In the event and on such occasion that the Aggregate
Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, the
Borrower shall prepay Revolving Credit Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or,
if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in the account
established with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.07(j)) in an
aggregate amount equal to such excess. In the event and on such occasion that
the Aggregate Foreign Currency Exposure exceeds the Maximum Foreign Currency
Sublimit, the Borrower shall prepay Foreign Currency Borrowings in an aggregate
amount equal to such excess.

                  (c)      (i) If, subsequent to the Effective Date, either
Parent Guarantor or the Borrower shall issue any Equity Interests or Equity
Rights (it being understood that the issuance of debt securities convertible
into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any Equity Interest or Equity Right
shall be governed by Section 2.06(c)(ii) below) (other than any Excluded Equity
Issuance) (each, an "Equity Issuance"), 50% of the Net Proceeds thereof shall be
applied immediately after receipt thereof toward the prepayment of the Term B
Loans in accordance with Section 2.06(e) below.

                  (ii)     If, subsequent to the Effective Date, either Parent
Guarantor, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall incur or
permit the incurrence of any Indebtedness (including pursuant to debt securities
which are convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, any Equity
Interest or Equity Rights) (other than Excluded Debt Issuances) (each, a "Debt
Incurrence"), 100% of the Net Proceeds thereof shall be applied immediately
after receipt thereof toward the prepayment of the Term B Loans in accordance
with Section 2.06(e) below; provided that if at the time of such Debt
Incurrence, the Total Leverage Ratio as of the last Test Period for which a
Compliance Certificate has been delivered determined on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Debt Incurrence is less than 3.0x, then only 50% of the
Net Proceeds thereof shall be so applied.

                  (iii)    If, subsequent to the Effective Date, either Parent
Guarantor, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall receive Net
Proceeds from any Asset Sale, 100% of such Net Proceeds shall be applied
immediately after receipt thereof toward the prepayment of the Term B Loans in
accordance with Section 2.06(e) below; provided that (x) the Net Proceeds from
Asset Sales permitted by Section 6.05 shall not be required to be applied as
provided herein if and to the extent that (1) no Default or Event of Default
then exists or would arise therefrom and (2) the Borrower delivers an officers'
certificate to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date of such Asset
Sale stating that such Net Proceeds shall be reinvested in assets of the
Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary otherwise permitted to be acquired
pursuant to this Agreement in each case within 270 days (subject to Section
6.05(vii), if applicable) following the date of such Asset Sale (which
certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be so expended),
(y) all such Net Proceeds shall be held in the Collateral Account and released
therefrom only in accordance with the terms of the Security Agreement, and (z)
if all or any portion of such Net Proceeds not so applied as provided herein is
not so used within such 270-day period (subject to Section 6.05(vii), if
applicable), such remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of such
period as specified in this subsection (c)(iii); provided, further, if the
Property subject to such Asset Sale constituted Collateral under the Security
Documents, then any capital assets pur-

                                      -48-

chased with the Net Proceeds thereof pursuant to this subsection shall be
mortgaged or pledged, as the case may be, to the Collateral Agent, for its
benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured Parties in accordance with
Section 5.11.

                  (iv)     If, subsequent to the Effective Date, either Parent
Guarantor, the Borrower or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall receive
proceeds from insurance recoveries in respect of any Destruction or any proceeds
or awards in respect of any Taking, 100% of the Net Proceeds thereof shall be
applied immediately after receipt thereof toward the prepayment of the Term B
Loans in accordance with Section 2.06(e) below; provided that (x) so long as no
Default or Event of Default then exists or would arise therefrom, such Net
Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied to the extent that the Borrower
has delivered an officers' certificate to the Administrative Agent promptly
following the receipt of such Net Proceeds stating that such proceeds shall be
used to (1) repair, replace or restore any Property in respect of which such Net
Proceeds were paid or (2) fund the substitution of other Property used or usable
in the business of the Borrower or the Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case
within 270 days following the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds, (y) all
such Net Proceeds shall be held in the Collateral Account and released therefrom
only in accordance with the terms of the Security Agreement, and (z) if all or
any portion of such Net Proceeds not required to be applied to the prepayment of
Term B Loans pursuant to the preceding proviso is not so used within 270 days
after the date of the receipt of such Net Proceeds, such remaining portion shall
be applied on the last day of such period as specified in this subsection
(c)(iv); provided, further, if the Property subject to such Destruction or
Taking constituted Collateral under the Security Documents, then any replacement
or substitution Property purchased with the Net Proceeds thereof pursuant to
this subsection shall be mortgaged or pledged, as the case may be, to the
Collateral Agent, for its benefit and for the benefit of the other Secured
Parties in accordance with Section 5.11.

                  (v)      If, for any Fiscal Year of the Borrower commencing
with its Fiscal Year ending on December 31, 2004, there shall be Excess Cash
Flow of the Borrower and the Restricted Subsidiaries for such Fiscal Year, 50%
of such Excess Cash Flow shall be applied not later than 150 days after the end
of such Fiscal Year toward prepayment of the Term B Loans in accordance with
Section 2.06(e) below; provided that for the Fiscal Year ending on December 31,
2004, Excess Cash Flow to be applied toward the prepayment of the Term B Loans
pursuant to this Section 2.06(c)(v) shall be reduced by Foreign Excess Cash
Flow, if positive.

                  (d)      The Term B Loans shall be repaid in consecutive
quarterly installments on the dates set forth below (each such day, an
"Installment Payment Date"), commencing on December 31, 2003, in an aggregate
amount equal to the amount specified below for each such Installment Payment
Date.

exists or is continuing, then on such Prepayment Date, (i) the Borrower shall

                  (a)      General. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit for its
own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the
Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Credit
Commitment Period. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter
of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or
entered into by the Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of
Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

                  (b)      Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension;
Certain Conditions. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the
amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the
Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing
Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (reasonably in advance of
the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice
requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of
Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on
which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c)
of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of
the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to
prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the
Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on
the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of
Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if
(and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the
Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to
such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the LC Exposure shall not
exceed $25.0 million and (ii) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure shall not
exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment. With respect to any Letter of
Credit which contains any "evergreen" automatic renewal provision, the Issuing
Bank shall be deemed to have consented to any such extension or renewal provided
that all of the requirements of this Section 2.07 are met and no Default or
Event of Default exists and is continuing.

                  (c)      Expiration Date. Each Letter of Credit shall expire
at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date one year
after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any
renewal or extension thereof, one year after such renewal or extension) and (ii)
the date that is five Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

                  (d)      Participations. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit
(or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and
without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the
Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender
hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Revolving Lender's Commitment Percentage of the aggregate amount
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in
furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of
the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Commitment Percentage of each LC
Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the
date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement
payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving
Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations
pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or the
occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or reduction or
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments, and that each such payment
shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
whatsoever.

                  (e)      Reimbursement. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC
Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC
Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, if such payment is
made from the proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans, or 2:00 p.m., New York City
time, if such payment is made from cash or is made from the proceeds of a
Swingline Loan, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower
shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York
City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the
Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 12:00 noon, New
York City time, on (i) the Business Day that the Borrower receives such notice,
if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day
of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that the
Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time
on the day of receipt; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions
to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.02 or 2.04
that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan
in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower's
obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the
resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If the Borrower fails to
make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving
Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower
in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's Commitment Percentage thereof.
Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to
the Administrative Agent its Commitment Percentage of the payment then due from
the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.02 with respect to
Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.02 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so
received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the
Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Re-

                                      -52-

<PAGE>

volving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the
Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their
interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the
funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall
not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse such LC Disbursement.

                  (f)      Obligations Absolute. The Borrower's obligation to
reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section 2.07
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all
circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or
provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of
Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any
statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by
the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or
other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or
(iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute
a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the
Borrower's obligations hereunder. Neither the Administrative Agent, the
Revolving Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall
have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the
issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make
any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in
the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in
transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a
drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any
consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank; provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from
liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to
consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the
Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower
that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining
whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply
with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall
be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of
the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree
that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in
substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank
may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents
without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or
information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such
documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.

                  (g)      Disbursement Procedures. The Issuing Bank shall,
promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to
represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issu-

                                      -53-

<PAGE>

ing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder; provided that any
failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of
its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with
respect to any such LC Disbursement.

                  (h)      Interim Interest. If the Issuing Bank shall make any
LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement
in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof
shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such
LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided that if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.07, then Section 2.09(c) shall
apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of
the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment
by any Revolving Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.07 to
reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent
of such payment.

                  (i)      Replacement of the Issuing Bank. The Issuing Bank may
be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.
The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the
Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced
Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b). From and after the effective date of
any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights
and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters
of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term
"Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous
Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the
context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the
replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect
to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be
required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

                  (j)      Cash Collateralization. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice
from the Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders (or, if the maturity of
the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing
greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash
collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in a
collateral account reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent an amount in
cash equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid
interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral
shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately
due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (a) of
Section 7.01 or any Event of Default described in clause (i) of Section 7.01.
Each such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the
payment and performance of the Obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement
and the Borrower hereby grants the Collateral Agent a security interest in
respect of each such deposit and the collateral account in which such deposits
are held.

                                      -54-

<PAGE>

The Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the
exclusive right of withdrawal, over the collateral account. Other than any
interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be
made at the option and sole discretion of the Collateral Agent and at the
Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or
profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in the collateral account.
Moneys deposited in the collateral account pursuant to this Section 2.07(j)
shall be applied by the Collateral Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC
Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so
applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of
the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans
has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC
Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to
satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower
is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as
aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Defaults or Events of Default have been cured or waived.

                  SECTION 2.08. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the relevant Lenders (i) in respect of Revolving Credit
Borrowings and Foreign Currency Borrowings, on the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date (or such earlier date as, and to the extent that, such Revolving Dollar
Loan or Foreign Currency Loan becomes due and payable pursuant to Section 2.04,
2.05, 2.06, 2.12 or Article VII), the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving
Dollar Loan and Foreign Currency Loan and each Swingline Loan made to it by each
such Lender, in the applicable currency of such Loan, and (ii) in respect of
Term B Borrowings, on the Term B Loan Maturity Date (or such earlier date as,
and to the extent that, such Term B Loan becomes due and payable pursuant to
Section 2.06 or Article VII), the unpaid principal amount of each Term B Loan
held by each such Term B Lender. The Borrower hereby further agrees to pay
interest in immediately available funds at the applicable office of the
Administrative Agent (as specified in Section 2.14(a)) on the unpaid principal
amount of the Revolving Dollar Loans, Foreign Currency Loans, Swingline Loans
and Term B Loans made to it from time to time from the date hereof until payment
in full thereof at the rates per annum, and on the dates, set forth in Section
2.09. All payments required hereunder shall be made in the currency of such
Loan.

                  (b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of the
Borrower to the appropriate lending office of such Lender resulting from each
Loan made by such lending office of such Lender from time to time, including the
amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such lending office of
such Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

                  (c)      The Administrative Agent shall maintain the Register
pursuant to Section 10.04, and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register
and subaccounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the amount of each such
Loan, the Class and Type of each such Loan and the Interest Period applicable
thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to
become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder in re-

                                      -55-

<PAGE>

spect of each such Loan and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the
Administrative Agent hereunder from the Borrower in respect of each such Loan
and each Lender's share thereof.

                  (d)      The entries made in the Register and accounts
maintained pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Section 2.08 and the Notes
maintained pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 2.08 shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be prima facie evidence of the existence and
amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein recorded; provided, however,
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such
account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable, or any error therein,
shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay (with
applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

                  (e)      The Loans of each Class made by each Lender to the
Borrower shall, if requested by the applicable Lender (which request shall be
made to the Administrative Agent), be evidenced by a single Note duly executed
on behalf of the Borrower, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit
F-1 or F-2, as applicable, with the blanks appropriately filled, payable to the
order of such Lender.

                  SECTION 2.09. Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each
Eurocurrency Loan shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) for each day during each
Interest Period with respect thereto at a rate per annum equal to:

                  (i)      in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Loan, (A) the
         LIBO Rate determined for such Interest Period, plus (B) the Applicable
         Rate; or

                  (ii)     in the case of a Eurocurrency Term B Loan, (A) the
         LIBO Rate determined for such Interest Period plus (B) the Applicable
         Rate.

                  (b)      Each ABR Loan (including each Swingline Loan) shall
bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a
year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, or over a year of 360 days when the
Alternate Base Rate is determined by reference to clause (c) of the definition
of "Alternate Base Rate") at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate
plus the Applicable Rate.

                  (c)      If all or a portion of (i) the principal amount of
any Loan, (ii) any interest payable thereon or (iii) any Fee or other amount
payable hereunder shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated maturity
thereof or by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear
interest at a rate per annum (the "Default Rate")which is (x) in the case of
overdue principal (except as otherwise provided in clause (y) below), the rate
that would otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this Section 2.09 plus 2.00% per annum or (y) in the case of any overdue
interest, Fee or other amount, the rate described in Section 2.09(b) applicable
to an ABR Revolving Loan plus 2.00% per annum, in each case from the date of
such nonpayment to (but excluding) the date on which such amount is paid in full
(after as well as before judgment).

                                      -56-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date and on the Term B Loan Maturity Date and Revolving Credit Maturity
Date; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii)
in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan prior to the end of the
current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable
on the effective date of such conversion. Interest in respect of each Loan shall
accrue from and including the first day of an Interest Period to but excluding
the last day of such Interest Period. Interest on each Loan shall be paid in the
same currency as the currency in which the Loan is made.

                  SECTION 2.10. Computation of Interest. Each determination of
an interest rate by the Administrative Agent pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the
absence of manifest error.

                  SECTION 2.11. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay a
commitment fee (a "Commitment Fee") to each Revolving Lender, for which payment
will be made in arrears through the Administrative Agent on the last day of
March, June, September and December beginning after the Effective Date, and on
the Commitment Fee Termination Date (as defined below). The Commitment Fee due
to each Revolving Lender shall commence to accrue for a period commencing on the
Effective Date and shall cease to accrue on the date (the "Commitment Fee
Termination Date") that is the later of (i) the date on which the Revolving
Credit Commitment of such Revolving Lender shall be terminated as provided
herein and (ii) the first date after the end of the Revolving Credit Commitment
Period. The Commitment Fee accrued to each Revolving Lender shall equal 0.50%
per annum multiplied by such Lender's Commitment Fee Average Daily Amount (as
defined below) for the applicable quarter (or shorter period commencing on the
date of this Agreement and ending with such Lender's Commitment Fee Termination
Date). A Revolving Lender's "Commitment Fee Average Daily Amount" with respect
to a calculation period shall equal the average daily amount during such period
calculated using the daily amount of such Revolving Lender's Revolving Credit
Commitment less such Revolving Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure (excluding
clause (c) and, in the case of Revolving Lenders that are not also Foreign
Currency Lenders, clause (d) of the definition thereof for purposes of
determining the Commitment Fee Average Daily Amount only) for any applicable
days during such Revolving Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment Period. All
Commitment Fees shall be computed on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a year of 360 days.

                  (b)      The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative
Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect
to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at a rate per
annum equal to the Applicable Rate for Eurocurrency Revolving Loans on the
average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and
including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which
such Revolving Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment terminates and the date on
which such Revolving Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the
Issuing Bank a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.25% per annum
on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding any portion

                                      -57-

<PAGE>

thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from
and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date of
termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the date on which there
ceases to be any LC Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with
respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit
or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees
(collectively, "LC Fees") accrued through and including the last day of March,
June, September and December of each calendar year during the Revolving Credit
Commitment Period shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last
day, commencing on the first such date to occur after the Effective Date;
provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving
Credit Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which
the Revolving Credit Commitments terminate shall be payable on demand. Any other
fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable
within 10 days after demand therefor. All participation fees and fronting fees
shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for
the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the
last day).

                  (c)      The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent the annual administrative fee set forth in the Fee Letter (the "Agent
Fees").

                  (d)      All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution. Once
paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable.

                  SECTION 2.12. Termination, Reduction or Adjustment of
Commitments. (a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Term B Commitments shall
terminate at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Effective Date and (ii) the
Revolving Credit Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date.

                  (b)      The Borrower shall have the right, upon one Business
Day's notice to the Administrative Agent, to terminate or, from time to time,
reduce the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments; provided that no such
termination or reduction of Revolving Credit Commitments shall be permitted if,
after giving effect thereto and to any repayments of the Loans made on the
effective date thereof, (i) the Aggregate Revolving Credit Exposure then
outstanding would exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect or
(ii) the Aggregate Foreign Currency Exposure then outstanding would exceed the
Maximum Foreign Currency Sublimit then in effect. Any such reduction shall be in
an amount equal to $5.0 million or a whole multiple of $1.0 million in excess
thereof and shall reduce permanently the Revolving Credit Commitments then in
effect.

                  (c)      If any prepayment of Term B Borrowings would
otherwise be required pursuant to Section 2.06 but cannot be made because there
are no Term B Borrowings outstanding, or because the amount of the required
prepayment exceeds the outstanding amount of Term B Borrowings, then, on the
date that such prepayment is required, the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
permanently reduced by an aggregate amount equal to the amount of the required
prepayment, or the excess of such amount over the outstanding amount of Term B
Borrowings, as the case may be.

                                      -58-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of the applicable Revolving Lenders, on each date of termination
or reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Commitment Fee on the
amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments so terminated or reduced accrued to
the date of such termination or reduction.

                  (e)      Each reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments
shall reduce the Swingline Commitment of the Swingline Lender, and the Maximum
Foreign Currency Sublimit and the Foreign Currency Sublimit of each Foreign
Currency Lender, by an equal percentage.

                  SECTION 2.13. Inability to Determine Interest Rate;
Unavailability of Deposits; Inadequacy of Interest Rate. If prior to 11:00 a.m.,
London time, two Business Days before the first day of any Interest Period,
including an initial Interest Period, for a requested Eurocurrency Borrowing:

                  (i)      the Administrative Agent shall have determined in
         good faith (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon
         the Borrower) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant
         market generally, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
         ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the currency in which any
         Eurocurrency Loan is denominated or the currency specified in the
         Borrowing Request for such Eurocurrency Borrowing (the "Applicable
         Currency") for such Interest Period, or

                  (ii)     the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
         from a majority in interest of the Lenders of the applicable Class that
         the Adjusted LIBO Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest
         Period for such Applicable Currency will not adequately and fairly
         reflect the cost to such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such
         Lenders) of making or maintaining their affected Loans during such
         Interest Period,

then the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof
to the Borrower and the Lenders by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the same
day. The Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice to the
Borrower and the Lenders as soon as practicable after the circumstances giving
rise to such notice no longer exist, and until such notice has been given, any
affected Eurocurrency Loans of the Applicable Currency shall not be (x)
converted or continued pursuant to Section 2.03 or (y) made pursuant to a
Borrowing Request, and shall be continued or made as ABR Loans (including the
requirement that all Foreign Currency Loans shall be replaced by Revolving
Dollar Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(ii)), as the case may be.

                  SECTION 2.14. Pro Rata Treatment and Payments. (a) Each
reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of the Revolving Lenders shall be
made pro rata according to the amounts of such Revolving Lenders' Commitment
Percentages. Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account
of principal of and interest on Loans which are ABR Loans shall be made pro rata
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of such ABR Loans then
held by the Lenders of the applicable Class. Each payment (including each
prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on Loans
which are Eurocurrency Loans designated by the Borrower to be applied to a
particular Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be made pro rata according to the
respective outstanding principal amounts of such

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

Loans then held by the Lenders of the applicable Class. Each payment (including
each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of principal of and interest on
Swingline Loans and Foreign Currency Loans shall be made pro rata according to
the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Swingline Loans or Foreign
Currency Loans, as applicable, or participating interests therein, as the case
may be, then held by the relevant Lenders. All payments (including prepayments)
to be made by the Borrower hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest,
fees or otherwise, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be
made prior to 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the due date thereof to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders of the applicable Class, at
the Administrative Agent's New York office specified in Section 10.01 in the
currency in which the applicable obligation is denominated (except as set forth
in Section 2.04) and in immediately available funds. The Administrative Agent
shall distribute such payments to the Lenders entitled thereto in the same
currency as received and promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any
payment hereunder (other than payments on Eurocurrency Loans) becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day, and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension. If any payment on a Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a
day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day (and, with respect to payments of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate during such
extension) unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment
into another calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding Business Day.

                  (b)      Subject to Section 2.13, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to a Borrowing
that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its share of
such Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent
may assume that such Lender is making such amount available to the
Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on
the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
on demand, such amount with interest thereon at a rate equal to the daily
average Federal Funds Effective Rate for the period until such Lender makes such
amount immediately available to the Administrative Agent. A certificate of the
Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing
under this Section 2.14(b) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
If such Lender's share of such Borrowing is not made available to the
Administrative Agent by such Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing
Date, the Administrative Agent shall also be entitled to recover such amount
with interest thereon at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Revolving Loans
hereunder, on demand, from the Borrower, but without prejudice to any right or
claim that the Borrower may have against such Lender.

                  (c)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the

                                      -60-

<PAGE>

amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards
payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.

                  SECTION 2.15. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
herein, if the adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the
interpretation or application thereof, shall make it unlawful for any Lender to
make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the
commitment of such Lender hereunder to make Eurocurrency Loans, continue
Eurocurrency Loans as such and convert ABR Loans to Eurocurrency Loans shall
forthwith be suspended until such time as the making or maintaining of
Eurocurrency Loans shall no longer be unlawful, and (b) such Lender's Loans then
outstanding as Eurocurrency Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to
ABR Loans (including the requirement that all Foreign Currency Loans shall be
replaced by Revolving Dollar Loans pursuant to Section 2.04(a)(ii)) on the
respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to such
Loans or within such earlier period as required by law.

                  SECTION 2.16. Requirements. (a) If at any time any Lender or
the Issuing Bank determines that the introduction of, or any change in or in the
interpretation of, any law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order
(other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements
included in determining the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the compliance by such Lender
or the Issuing Bank with any guideline, request or directive from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law),
shall have the effect of increasing the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank
for agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loans or
participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit, then the Borrower
shall from time to time, within five days of demand therefor by such Lender or
the Issuing Bank (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or the Issuing Bank,
as applicable, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or the
Issuing Bank for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such
increased cost, submitted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent by such
Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error. Such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, shall
promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of the
occurrence of any such event, such notice to state, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor and the additional amount required fully to compensate such
Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such increased cost or reduced
amount. Such additional amounts shall be payable directly to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as applicable, within five days of the Borrower's receipt of such
notice, and such notice shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive
and binding on the Borrower.

                  (b)      If any change in, or the introduction, adoption,
effectiveness, interpretation, reinterpretation or phase-in of, any law or
regulation, directive, guideline, decision or request (whether or not having the
force of law) of any court, central bank, regulator or other Governmental
Authority after the date hereof affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or the Issuing Bank (or a
holding company control-

                                      -61-

<PAGE>

ling such Lender or the Issuing Bank) and such Lender or the Issuing Bank
determines (in its sole and absolute discretion) that the rate of return on its
capital (or the capital of its holding company, as the case may be) as a
consequence of its Revolving Credit Commitment or the Loans made by it or its
participations in Swingline Loans or Foreign Currency Loans or any issuance,
participation or maintenance of Letters of Credit is reduced to a level below
that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank (or its holding company) could have
achieved but for the occurrence of any such circumstance, then, in any such case
upon notice from time to time by such Lender or the Issuing Bank to the
Borrower, the Borrower shall immediately pay directly to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank, as the case may be, additional amounts sufficient to compensate
such Lender or the Issuing Bank (or its holding company) for such reduction in
rate of return. A statement of such Lender or the Issuing Bank as to any such
additional amount or amounts (including calculations thereof in reasonable
detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower. In determining such amount, such Lender or the Issuing Bank may
use any method of averaging and attribution that it (in its sole and absolute
discretion) shall deem applicable.

                  (c)      In the event that the Issuing Bank or any Lender
determines that any event or circumstance that will lead to a claim under this
Section 2.16 has occurred or will occur, the Issuing Bank or such Lender will
use its best efforts to so notify the Borrower; provided that any failure to
provide such notice shall in no way impair the rights of the Issuing Bank or
such Lender to demand and receive compensation under this Section 2.16, but
without prejudice to any claims of the Borrower for compensation for actual
damages sustained as a result of any failure to observe this undertaking.

                  SECTION 2.17. Taxes. (a) All payments by the Borrower of
principal of, and interest on, the Loans and all other amounts payable under the
Loan Documents and the Notes shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any present or future income, excise, stamp or franchise taxes and
other taxes, fees, duties, withholdings or other charges of any nature
whatsoever imposed by any taxing authority on the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Bank, any Lender or any assignee of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as
the case may be, or a Participant or a change in designation of the lending
office of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be (a "Transferee"), but
excluding taxes imposed on or measured by the recipient's net income (or
franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof) that are imposed by a taxing authority
in a jurisdiction in which the recipient is incorporated or organized or
maintains its principal place of business or a lending office (such non-excluded
items and any interest, penalties and related reasonable costs and expenses,
being called "Taxes"), unless required by applicable law, rule or regulation. In
the event that any withholding or deduction from any payment to be made by the
Borrower hereunder is required in respect of any Taxes pursuant to any
applicable law, rule or regulation, then the Borrower will:

                  (i)      pay directly to the relevant authority the full
         amount required to be so withheld or deducted;

                                      -62-

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     promptly forward to the Administrative Agent an
         official receipt or other documentation satisfactory to the
         Administrative Agent evidencing such payment to such authority; and

                  (iii)    pay to the Administrative Agent for its account or
         the account of a Lender, the Issuing Bank or the Transferee, as the
         case may be, such additional amount or amounts as are necessary to
         ensure that the net amount actually received by the Administrative
         Agent, such Lender, the Issuing Bank or such Transferee, as the case
         may be, will equal the full amount the Administrative Agent, such
         Lender, the Issuing Bank or such Transferee, as the case may be, would
         have received had no such withholding or deduction been required
         (including withholding or deduction in respect of additional amounts
         payable under this Section 2.17).

Moreover, if any Taxes are directly asserted, whether or not correctly asserted,
against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender or Transferee
with respect to any payment received by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank or such Lender or Transferee hereunder, the Borrower will promptly
indemnify each such party for the full amount of such Taxes.

                  (b)      If the Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to
the appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent,
for its account or the account of the Issuing Bank, the respective Lenders or
Transferees, the required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the
Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, the Lenders
and the Transferees for any incremental Taxes that may become payable by the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender or Transferee as a result
of any such failure. For purposes of this Section 2.17, a distribution hereunder
by the Administrative Agent to or for the account of the Issuing Bank or any
Lender or Transferee shall be deemed a payment by the Borrower.

                  (c)      Each Lender or Transferee that is organized under the
laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States of America or any state or
political subdivision thereof shall, on or prior to the Effective Date (in the
case of each Lender that is a party hereto on the Effective Date) or on or prior
to the date of any assignment, participation or change in the designated lending
office hereunder (in the case of a Transferee) and thereafter as reasonably
requested from time to time by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, execute
and deliver, if legally able to do so, to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent one or more (as the Borrower or the Administrative Agent may reasonably
request) United States Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN or such other forms
or documents (or successor forms or documents) reasonably requested by the
Borrower, appropriately completed, as may be applicable to establish the extent,
if any, to which a payment to such Lender or Transferee is exempt from or
entitled to a reduced rate of withholding or deduction of Taxes imposed by the
United States. If a Lender or Transferee becomes aware of any fact that would
cause any form previously provided by such Lender or Transferee pursuant to this
paragraph (c) to become untrue in any material respect, or would prevent such
Lender or Transferee from providing a renewal form upon expiration of the form
previously provided, such Lender or Transferee shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent.

                                      -63-

<PAGE>

                  (d)      The Borrower shall not be required to indemnify or to
pay any additional amounts to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender or Transferee with respect to any Taxes imposed by the United States
pursuant to Section 2.17(a), Section 2.17(b) or this Section 2.17(d) to the
extent that (i) any obligation to withhold, deduct or pay amounts with respect
to such Tax existed on the date the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
such Lender or Transferee became a party to this Agreement or otherwise became a
Transferee (and, in such case, the Borrower may deduct and withhold such Tax
from payments to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank, such Lender or
Transferee); provided that this clause (i) shall not apply to a party that is
not an original party to this Agreement (a "Subsequent Party") to the extent
that the Borrower's obligations with respect to such Subsequent Party on the
date such party becomes a Subsequent Party do not exceed the Borrower's
obligations with respect to the Subsequent Party's predecessor immediately prior
thereto, or (ii) any Lender or Transferee fails to comply in full with the
provisions of paragraph (c) above (and, in such case, the Borrower may deduct
and withhold all Taxes required by law as a result of such noncompliance from
payments to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender or
Transferee).

                  (e)      In addition, the Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes
imposed to the relevant Governmental Authority imposing such Other Taxes in
accordance with applicable law.

                  SECTION 2.18. Indemnity. In the event any Lender shall incur
any loss or expense (including any loss (other than lost profit) or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to make, continue or maintain any portion of the
principal amount of any Loan as, or to convert any portion of the principal
amount of any Loan into, a Eurocurrency Loan) as a result of any conversion of a
Eurocurrency Loan to an ABR Loan or repayment or prepayment of the principal
amount of any Eurocurrency Loan on a date other than the scheduled last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, whether pursuant to Section 2.03, 2.04,
2.06, 2.08, 2.13, 2.15, 2.16 or 2.21 or otherwise, or any failure to borrow or
convert any Eurocurrency Loan after notice thereof shall have been given
hereunder, whether by reason of any failure to satisfy a condition to such
Borrowing or otherwise, then, upon the written notice of such Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall, within
five days of its receipt thereof, pay directly to such Lender such amount as
will (in the reasonable determination of such Lender) reimburse such Lender for
such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include calculations in
reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower.

                  SECTION 2.19. Change of Lending Office. Each Lender (or
Transferee) agrees that, upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the
operation of Section 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 with respect to such Lender (or
Transferee), it will, if requested by the Borrower, use commercially reasonable
efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender (or
Transferee)) to designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such
event with the object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that
such designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender,
cause such Lender and its respective lending offices to suffer no material
economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage; and provided, further, that nothing
in this Section 2.19 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the
Borrower or the rights of any Lender (or Transferee) pursuant to Sections 2.15,
2.16 and 2.17.

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

                  SECTION 2.20. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that if
it shall, through the exercise of a right of banker's lien, setoff or
counterclaim against the Borrower, or pursuant to a secured claim under Section
506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest arising
from, or in lieu of, such secured claim received by such Lender under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any
other means, obtain payment (voluntary or involuntary) in respect of any Loans
or participations in LC Disbursements which at the time shall be due and payable
as a result of which the unpaid principal portion of its Loans and
participations in LC Disbursements which at the time shall be due and payable
shall be proportionately less than the unpaid principal portion of such Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements of any other Lender, it shall be deemed
simultaneously to have purchased from such other Lender at face value, and shall
promptly pay to such other Lender the purchase price for, a participation in
such Loans and participations in LC Disbursements of such other Lender, so that
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of such Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements held by each Lender shall be in the same proportion to the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of all such Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements as prior to such exercise of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim
or other event; provided, however, that if any such purchase or purchases or
adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Section and the payment giving rise
thereto shall thereafter be recovered, such purchase or purchases or adjustments
shall be rescinded to the extent of such recovery and the purchase price or
prices or adjustments restored without interest. The Borrower expressly consents
to the foregoing arrangements and agrees that any Lender holding a participation
in a Loan or an LC Disbursement deemed to have been so purchased may exercise
any and all rights of banker's lien, setoff or counterclaim with respect to any
and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender by reason thereof as fully
as if such Lender were a direct creditor directly to the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

                  SECTION 2.21. Assignment of Commitments Under Certain
Circumstances. In the event that (a) any Lender shall have delivered a notice or
certificate pursuant to Section 2.16, or the Borrower shall be required to make
additional payments to any Lender under Section 2.17 (each, an "Increased Cost
Lender"), or (b) in connection with any proposed amendment, modification,
termination, waiver or consent with respect to any of the provisions hereof that
fall within the proviso to the first sentence of Section 10.08(b), the consent
of all Lenders would have been obtained but for one or more Lenders representing
no more than 25% of the aggregate amount of Term B Loans outstanding and the
Revolving Credit Commitments (or after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the
Revolving Credit Exposure) failure to consent (each such Lender, a
"Non-Consenting Lender"); then, with respect to each such Increased Cost Lender
or Non-Consenting Lender (the "Terminated Lender"), the Borrower shall have the
right, but not the obligation, at its own expense, upon notice to such
Terminated Lender and the Administrative Agent, to replace such Terminated
Lender with an assignee (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 10.04) approved by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing
Bank, the Swingline Lender and Foreign Currency Lender (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld), and such Terminated Lender hereby agrees to transfer
and assign without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions
contained in Section 10.04) all its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement to such assignee; provided, however, that no Terminated Lender shall
be obligated to make any such assignment unless (i) such assignment

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

shall not conflict with any law or any rule, regulation or order of any
Governmental Authority and (ii) such assignee or the Borrower shall pay to the
affected Terminated Lender in immediately available funds on the date of such
assignment the principal of and interest accrued to the date of payment on the
Loans made by such Terminated Lender and participations in LC Disbursements,
Swingline Loans and Foreign Currency Loans held by such Terminated Lender and
all commitment fees and other fees owed to such Terminated Lender hereunder and
all other amounts accrued for such Terminated Lender's account or owed to it
hereunder (including, without limitation, any Commitment Fees).

                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  In order to induce the Lenders and the Administrative Agent to
enter into this Agreement and to extend credit hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, the Loan Parties, jointly and severally, make the
representations and warranties set forth in this Article III on the Effective
Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) and upon the occurrence of each
Credit Event thereafter:

                  SECTION 3.01. Organization, etc. Each Loan Party (a) is a
corporation or other form of legal entity, and each of its Subsidiaries is a
corporation, partnership or other form of legal entity, duly organized and
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation or organization, as the case may be, (b) has the requisite
corporate or other power and authority to carry on its business as now
conducted, (c) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation or foreign partnership (or comparable foreign qualification,
if applicable, in the case of any other form of legal entity), as the case may
be, in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to so qualify will not result in a
Material Adverse Effect, and (d) has full power and authority and holds all
requisite material governmental licenses, permits and other approvals to enter
into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and each other Loan
Document to which it is a party and to own or hold under lease its Property and
to conduct its business substantially as currently conducted by it.

                  SECTION 3.02. Due Authorization, Non-Contravention, etc.
Assuming the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the other
parties hereto, the execution, delivery and performance by each Loan Party of
this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party, the
borrowing of the Loans, the use of the proceeds thereof and the issuance of the
Letters of Credit hereunder are within each Loan Party's corporate, partnership
or comparable powers, as the case may be, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate, partnership or comparable and, if required, stockholder
action, as the case may be, and do not

                  (a)      contravene the Organic Documents of any Loan Party or
         any of its respective Subsidiaries;

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

                  (b)      subject to the receipt of government approvals set
         forth on Schedule 3.03, contravene any law or governmental regulation
         or court decree or order binding on or affecting any Loan Party or any
         of its respective Subsidiaries;

                  (c)      except as set forth on Schedule 3.02, violate or
         result in a default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument
         binding upon any Loan Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries; or

                  (d)      result in, or require the creation or imposition of,
         any Lien on any assets of any Loan Party or any of its respective
         Subsidiaries that would have or could reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect, except Liens created under the Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 3.03. Government Approval, Regulation, etc. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.03, no consent, authorization or approval or other
action by, and no notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority or
regulatory body or other Person is required for the due execution, delivery or
performance by the Borrower or any other Loan Party of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, the borrowing of the Loans, the use of the proceeds thereof
and the issuance of Letters of Credit hereunder, nor for the consummation of the
Transactions, except such as have been obtained or made and are in full force
and effect and except filings necessary to perfect Liens under the Security
Documents. No Loan Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries is an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended,
or a "holding company", or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company", or an
"affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
as amended.

                  SECTION 3.04. Validity, etc. This Agreement and each other
Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a party has been duly executed
and delivered by such Loan Party and constitutes, assuming the due execution and
delivery of this Agreement and such other Loan Document by each of the other
parties thereto, the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Loan Party
enforceable in accordance with its respective terms, subject to the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the
enforceability of creditors' rights generally and to general principles of
equity.

                  SECTION 3.05. Activities of Parent Guarantors and Acquisition
Corp. As of the Effective Date, each of the Parent Guarantors and Acquisition
Corp. has had no operations, assets or liabilities.

                  SECTION 3.06. Representations and Warranties in the Merger
Agreement. (a) Each of the representations and warranties set forth in Article
III of the Merger Agreement remains true and correct (unless expressly stated to
relate to an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties
were true and correct as of such earlier date).

                  (b)      Subject to the qualifications set forth in Section
7.3(a) of the Merger Agreement, each of the representations and warranties set
forth in Article IV of the Merger

ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, which

                  SECTION 3.11. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. None of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has violated, is in violation of or has been
given written notice of any violation of any laws (other than Environmental

Mortgaged Properties), except for defects in title (or such other rights as
referenced above, as applicable) that do not materially interfere with its
ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties and assets for their intended purposes and except where the failure
to have such title (or such other rights as referenced above, as applicable) in
the aggregate could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. All such material properties and assets are free and clear of Liens,
other than Permitted Liens.

                  (b)      As of the Effective Date, Schedule 3.13(b) contains
and will contain a true and complete list of each parcel of Real Property (i)
owned in fee by any Loan Party as of the date hereof and describes the type of

occupied by any Loan Party, as lessee, as of the date hereof and describes the
type of interest therein held by such Loan Party and whether such lease,
sublease or other instrument requires the consent of the landlord thereunder or

                  (c)      Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
complied with all obligations under all leases to which it is a party, except
where the failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect, and all
such leases are in full force and effect, except leases in respect of which the
failure to be in full force and effect could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases, other than leases in

Adverse Effect.

respective Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any actual pending or

                  (f)      Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated on the Effective Date under any right of first refusal, option or
other contractual right to sell, assign or otherwise dispose of any Mortgaged

                  SECTION 3.14. Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
has timely filed all federal, foreign and all other material income tax returns
and reports required by law to have been filed by it and has paid all taxes and
governmental charges due, except any such taxes or charges which are being
diligently contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which
adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP shall have been set aside on its
books; provided that any such contest of taxes or charges with respect to
Collateral shall satisfy the Contested Collateral Lien Conditions.

                  SECTION 3.15. Pension and Welfare Plans. (a) No ERISA Event
has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or give rise to a Lien on the assets
of any Loan Party or a Subsidiary. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries and their
ERISA Affiliates are in compliance in all respects with the presently applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan except for failures
to so comply which could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. No condition exists or event or transaction has occurred with respect to
any Plan which reasonably might result in the incurrence by the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of any liability, fine or penalty
which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither
the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has any contingent liability with
respect to post-retirement benefits provided by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries under a Welfare Plan, other than (i) liability for continuation
coverage described in Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, (ii) liabilities
under employment agreements existing on the Effective Date and (iii) liabilities
that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

Material Adverse Effect or as set forth on Schedule 3.15(b), (i) each Foreign
Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
of any and all applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has
been maintained, where required, in good standing with applicable regulatory

incurred any obligation in connection with the termination of or withdrawal from
any Foreign Plan.

                  SECTION 3.16. Environmental Warranties. Except as set forth on

                  (a)      All facilities and property owned, leased or operated
         by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and all operations
         conducted thereon, are in compliance with all Environmental Laws,
         except for such noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate,
         could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  inquiries received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
                  regarding Environmental Liability,

         be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      There have been no Releases of Hazardous Materials
         at, on, under or from any property now or, to any Loan Party's
         knowledge, previously owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any
         of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
         could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d)      The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have been issued
         and are in compliance with all Environmental Permits necessary for
         their operations, facilities and businesses and each is in full force

         obtained or as to which the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are not in
         compliance, or are not in effect, individually or in the aggregate,
         could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (e)      No property now or, to any Loan Party's knowledge,
         previously owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries is listed or proposed (with respect to owned property
         only) for listing on the CERCLIS or on any similar state list of sites
         requiring investigation or clean-up, or on the National Priorities List
         pursuant to CERCLA.

                  (f)      There are no underground storage tanks, active or
         abandoned, including petroleum storage tanks, surface impoundments or
         disposal areas, on or under any property now or, to any Loan Party's
         knowledge (without independent investigation or inquiry), previously
         owned or leased by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which,
         singly or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (g)      Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
         transported or arranged for the transportation of any Hazardous
         Material to any location which is listed or proposed for listing on the
         National Priorities List pursuant to CERCLA, on the CERCLIS or on any
         similar state list or which is the subject of federal, state or local
         enforcement actions or other investigations which would reasonably be
         expected to lead to any Environmental Claim against the Borrower or
         such Subsidiary that could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  (h)      No liens have been recorded pursuant to any
         Environmental Law with respect to any property or other assets

                  (i)      Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
         currently conducting any Remedial Action pursuant to any Environmental
         Law, nor has any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries assumed by contract, agreement or operation of law any
         obligation under Environmental Law, the cost of which, singly or in the
         aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect.

                  (j)      There are no polychlorinated biphenyls or friable
         asbestos present at any property owned, leased or operated by the
         Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, which, singly or in the aggregate,
         could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 3.17. Regulations U and X. The Loans, the use of the
proceeds thereof, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will
not result in a violation of or be inconsistent with any provision of Regulation
U or X.

                  SECTION 3.18. Disclosure; Accuracy of Information; Pro Forma
Balance Sheets and Projected Financial Statements. (a) The Loan Parties have
disclosed to the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
restrictions to which they or any of their Subsidiaries is subject, and all
other matters known to any of them that, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither this Agreement
nor the factual statements in any other document, certificate or statement
furnished to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by or on behalf of any Loan
Party in connection herewith (including, without limitation, the Information
Memorandum) contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained herein and
therein not misleading, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made; provided that to the extent this or any such document, certificate or
statement (including without limitation the Information Memorandum) was based
upon or constitutes a forecast, projection or internal summary analysis, the
Loan Parties represent only that they acted in good faith and utilized
reasonable assumptions and due care in the preparation of such document,
certificate or statement for the purposes intended.

                  (b)      Not less than one week prior to the Effective Date,
the Borrower shall have furnished to the Lenders the pro forma consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 2003, prepared giving effect to the Transactions as
if the Transactions had occurred on such date. Such pro forma consolidated
balance sheet (i) was prepared in good faith based on the same assumptions used
to prepare the pro forma financial statements included in the Information
Memorandum, (ii) accurately reflects all adjustments necessary to give effect to
the Transactions and (iii) presents fairly the pro forma financial position of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date, as if
the Transactions had occurred on such date.

                  (c)      Not less than one week prior to the Effective Date,
the Borrower shall have furnished to the Lenders pro forma consolidated income
statement projections for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, pro forma
consolidated balance sheet projections for the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and
pro forma consolidated cash flow projections for the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, all for the Fiscal Years ending 2004 through 2008, inclusive (the
"Projected Financial Statements"), which give effect to the Transactions and all
Indebtedness and Liens incurred

                                      -72-

<PAGE>

or created in connection with the Transactions. The assumptions made in
preparing the Projected Financial Statements are reasonable as of the date of
such projections and all material assumptions with respect to the Projected
Financial Statements are set forth therein. The Projected Financial Statements
present a good faith estimate of the consolidated financial information
contained therein at the date thereof, it being recognized by the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, however, that projections as to future events are not to
be viewed as facts and that the actual results during the period or periods
covered by the projections probably will differ from the projected results and
that the difference may be material.

                  SECTION 3.19. Insurance. As of the Effective Date, set forth
on Schedule 3.19 is a summary of all insurance policies maintained by the
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries with financially sound and responsible
insurers (a) with respect to its properties material to the business of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries against such casualties and contingencies and of
such types and in such amounts as are customary in the case of similar
businesses operating in the same or similar locations, and (b) required to be
maintained pursuant to the Security Documents.

                  SECTION 3.20. Labor Matters. Except as could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (a) there are no strikes, lockouts
or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge
of any Loan Party, threatened; (b) the hours worked by and payments made to
employees of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the
Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state, local or
foreign law dealing with such matters; and (c) all payments due from the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare
insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.

                  SECTION 3.21. Solvency. Immediately following the making of
each Loan and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds of such
Loans, and in the case of the Subsidiary Loan Parties, after giving effect to
the terms of the Guarantee Agreement, (a) the fair value of the assets of each
Loan Party, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of
the property of each Loan Party will be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) each Loan Party will be able to pay its debts
and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) each Loan Party will not have
unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in which it is
engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted.

                  SECTION 3.22. Securities. The common stock of each of the
Parent Guarantors' and the Borrower's Subsidiaries has been validly issued and
fully paid and is nonassessable and free of preemptive rights that have not been
waived. The Equity Interests of each Subsidiary held, directly or indirectly, by
the Borrower are owned, directly or indirectly, by the Borrower and, after the
Effective Date, by the Parent Guarantors, free and clear of all Liens. There are
not,

                                      -73-

<PAGE>

as of the Effective Date, any existing options, warrants, calls, subscriptions,
convertible or exchangeable securities, rights, agreements, commitments or
arrangements for any Person to acquire any common stock of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or any other securities convertible into, exchangeable for or
evidencing the right to subscribe for any such common stock, except as disclosed
in the financial statements delivered pursuant to Sections 5.01(a) and (b) or
otherwise disclosed to the Lenders prior to the Effective Date.

                  SECTION 3.23. Indebtedness Outstanding. Set forth on Schedule
6.01(a)(iii) hereto is a list and description of (a) all Indebtedness (without

                  SECTION 3.24. Security Documents. (a) The Pledge Agreement and
each Non-U.S. Pledge Agreement is effective to create in favor of the Collateral
Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Secured Parties, a legal, valid and
enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined in the Pledge
Agreement or Non-U.S. Pledge Agreement, as applicable) and, when such Collateral
is delivered to the Collateral Agent, the Pledge Agreement shall constitute a
fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest
of the pledgor thereunder in such Collateral.

                  (b)      (i) The Security Agreement is effective to create in
favor of the Collateral Agent, for its benefit and the benefit of the Secured
Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as
defined in the Security Agreement) and (ii) when (x) financing statements in
appropriate form are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 7 to the
Perfection Certificate and (y) upon the taking of possession or control by the
Collateral Agent of any such Collateral in which a security interest may be
perfected only by possession or control (which possession or control shall be
given to the Collateral Agent to the extent possession or control by the
Collateral Agent is required by the Security Agreement), the Security Agreement
shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right,
title and interest of the grantors thereunder in such Collateral (other than the
Intellectual Property (as defined in the Security Agreement)) to the extent such
Lien and security interest can be perfected by the filing of a financing
statement pursuant to the UCC or by possession or control by the Collateral
Agent, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other than
with respect to Permitted Liens.

                  (c)      When the filings in clause (b)(ii)(x) above are made

interest may be perfected by filing, recording or registering a security
agreement, financing statement or analogous document

in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the United States Copyright
Office, as applicable (it being understood that subsequent recordings in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright Office
may be necessary to perfect a Lien on registered trademarks, trademark
applications and copyrights acquired by the Loan Parties after the Effective
Date), in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person other than
with respect to Permitted Liens.

                  (d)      Each Mortgage executed and delivered as of the
Effective Date is, or, to the extent any Mortgage is duly executed and delivered
thereafter by the relevant Loan Party, such Mortgage will be, effective to

Parties, a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on and security interest in all of
the Loan Parties' right, title and interest in and to the Mortgaged Properties

establish of record the Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and
interest of the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged Properties and the proceeds
thereof, in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, other

property insurance, all losses payable thereunder in an amount in excess of $2.0
million (other than losses related to claims in respect of business
interruption) shall be payable to the Collateral Agent, as an additional insured
and as loss payee, pursuant to a standard non-contributory New York mortgagee
endorsement and shall be in an amount at least sufficient to prevent coinsurance
liability; provided that the Collateral Agent, as loss payee pursuant to the
foregoing, shall not agree to the adjustment of any claim without the consent of
the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and (v)
with respect to liability insurance, the Collateral Agent shall be named as an
additional insured; provided, in the event that Borrower's or any Loan Parties'
compliance with this Agreement with respect to the insurance requirements of
this Section 5.04 will result in a default under any lease encumbered by a
Mortgagee, Mortgagor need only comply with the provisions of this Agreement with
respect to any such lease to the greatest extent possible without causing a
default under any such lease. Notwithstanding the inclusion in each insurance
policy of the provision described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, in the event any Loan Party gives the Collateral Agent written notice
that it does not intend to pay any premium relating to any insurance policy on
which the Collateral Agent is named or to be named as an additional insured when
due, the Collateral Agent shall not exercise its right to pay such premium so
long as such Loan Party delivers to the Collateral Agent a replacement insurance
policy or insurance certificate evidencing that such replacement policy or
certificate provides the same insurance coverage required under this Section
5.04 as the policy being replaced by such Loan Party with no lapse in such
coverage.

                  SECTION 5.05. Books and Records; Visitation Rights. Each Loan
Party will, and will cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, keep books
and records which accurately reflect its business affairs in all material
respects and material transactions and permit the Administrative Agent and each
Lender or any of their respective representatives, at reasonable times

                                      -88-

and intervals, to visit all of its offices, to discuss its financial matters
with its officers and independent public accountant and, upon the reasonable
request of the Administrative Agent or a Lender, to examine (and, at the expense
of the Borrower, photocopy extracts from) any of its books or other corporate or
partnership records.

                  SECTION 5.06. Environmental Covenant. Each Loan Party will,
and will cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to:

                  (a)      use and operate all of its facilities and properties
         in compliance with all Environmental Laws except for such noncompliance
         which, singly or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
         have a Material Adverse Effect, keep all Environmental Permits in
         effect and remain in compliance therewith and handle all Hazardous
         Materials in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, except
         for any noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect;

                  (b)      promptly notify the Administrative Agent and provide
         copies of all written inquiries, claims, complaints or notices from any
         Person relating to the environmental condition of its facilities and
         properties or compliance with or liability under any Environmental Law
         which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect,
         and promptly cure and have dismissed with prejudice or contest in good
         faith any actions and proceedings relating thereto;

                  (c)      in the event of the presence of any Hazardous
         Material on any Mortgaged Property which is in violation of any
         Environmental Law or which could reasonably be expected to have
         Environmental Liability which violation or Environmental Liability
         could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each
         applicable Loan Party and its Subsidiaries, upon discovery thereof,
         shall take all necessary steps to initiate and expeditiously complete
         all response, corrective and other action to mitigate and eliminate any
         such adverse effect in accordance with and to the extent required by
         applicable Environmental Laws, and shall keep the Administrative Agent
         informed of their actions;

                  (d)      at the written request of the Administrative Agent or
         the Requisite Lenders, which request shall specify in reasonable detail
         the basis therefor, each Loan Party will provide, at such Loan Party's
         sole cost and expense, an environmental site assessment report
         concerning any Mortgaged Property now or hereafter owned or leased by
         such Loan Party or any of its respective Subsidiaries, prepared by an
         environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to the
         Administrative Agent, indicating the presence or absence of Hazardous
         Materials and the potential cost of any Remedial Action in connection
         with such Hazardous Materials on, at, under or emanating from such
         Mortgaged Property pursuant to any applicable Environmental Law;
         provided that such request may be made only if (i) there has occurred
         and is continuing an Event of Default or (ii) the Administrative Agent
         or the Requisite Lenders reasonably believe that the Borrower or any
         such Mortgaged Property is not in compliance with Environmental Law and
         such noncompliance could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect, or that circumstances exist that could reasonably be
         expected to form the basis of an Environ-

                                      -89-

<PAGE>

         mental Claim against such Loan Party or to result in Environmental
         Liability, in each case that could reasonably be expected to have a
         Material Adverse Effect (in such events as are listed in this
         subparagraph, the environmental site assessment shall be focused upon
         the noncompliance or other circumstances as applicable). If any Loan
         Party fails to provide the same within 90 days after such request was
         made, the Administrative Agent may order the same, and such Loan Party
         shall grant and hereby grants to the Administrative Agent and the
         Requisite Lenders and their agents access to such Mortgaged Property
         and specifically grants the Administrative Agent and the Requisite
         Lenders an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of
         tenants, to perform such an assessment, all at such Loan Party's sole
         cost and expense; and

                  (e)      provide such information and certifications which the
         Administrative Agent may reasonably request from time to time to
         evidence compliance with this Section 5.06.

                  SECTION 5.07. Information Regarding Collateral. (a) Each year,
at the time of delivery of annual financial statements with respect to the
preceding Fiscal Year pursuant to clause (b) of Section 5.01, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer and the
chief legal officer of the Borrower (i) setting forth the information required
pursuant to Sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the Perfection
Certificate or confirming that there has been no change in such information
since the date of the Perfection Certificate delivered on the Effective Date or
the date of the most recent certificate delivered pursuant to this Section and
(ii) certifying that all UCC financing statements (including fixture filings, as
applicable) or other appropriate filings, recordings or registrations, including
all refilings, rerecordings and reregistrations, containing a description of the
Collateral have been filed of record in each governmental, municipal or other
appropriate office in each jurisdiction identified pursuant to clause (i) above
to the extent necessary to protect and perfect the security interests under the
Security Documents for a period of not less than 18 months after the date of
such certificate (except as noted therein with respect to any continuation
statements to be filed within such period).

                  SECTION  5.08. Existence; Conduct of Business. Each Loan Party
will, and will cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be
done all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect
its legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits, privileges, franchises,
patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade names material to the conduct of its
business; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit any merger,
consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted under Section 6.03.

                  SECTION 5.09. Performance of Obligations. Each Loan Party and
its respective Subsidiaries will perform all of their respective obligations
under the terms of each mortgage, indenture, security agreement, other debt
instrument and material contract by which they are bound or to which they are a
party, except for such noncompliance as individual or in the aggregate would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  SECTION 5.10. Casualty and Condemnation. Each Loan Party (a)
will furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders prompt written notice
of any casualty or other in-

                                      -90-

<PAGE>

sured damage to any Collateral in an amount in excess of $5.0 million or the
commencement of any action or proceeding for the Taking of any Collateral or any
part thereof or interest therein under power of eminent domain or by
condemnation or similar proceeding and (b) will ensure that the Net Proceeds of
any such event (whether in the form of insurance proceeds, condemnation awards
or otherwise) are collected and applied in accordance with the applicable
provisions of this Agreement and the Security Documents.

                  SECTION 5.11. Pledge of Additional Collateral. In any event
within 30 days after the acquisition of assets of the type that would have
constituted Collateral on the Effective Date pursuant to the Security Documents
(the "Additional Collateral"), each appropriate Loan Party will, and will cause
its respective Restricted Subsidiaries to, take all necessary action, including
the filing of appropriate financing statements under the provisions of the UCC,
applicable domestic or local laws, rules or regulations in each of the offices
where such filing is necessary or appropriate, or entering into or amending the
Guarantee Agreement and the Security Documents, or in the case of the Equity
Interests of a "first tier" Non-U.S. Subsidiary organized in a Non-U.S.
Jurisdiction specified on Schedule 4.01(c), entering into a Non-U.S. Pledge
Agreement providing for the relevant Loan Party to have an enforceable and
perfected security interest in 65% of the voting Equity Interests and 100% of
the non-voting Equity Interests in such Subsidiary, to grant to the Collateral
Agent for its benefit and the benefit of the Secured Parties a perfected first
priority Lien in such Collateral pursuant to and to the full extent required by
the Security Documents and this Agreement (including, without limitation,
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in subsections (c) and (x) of Section
4.01). In the event that any Loan Party or its respective Subsidiaries acquire
an interest in additional Real Property having a fair market value in excess of
$2.0 million as determined in good faith by the Borrower or renews or enters
into any new lease of Real Property for a term of one (1) year or more (whether
or not the subject of a leasehold mortgage under the Security Documents on the
Effective Date) for space in excess of 50,000 rentable square feet and with
respect to a facility where manufacturing and/or research activities are
undertaken, the Borrower or the appropriate Loan Party or Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, and using its commercially reasonable efforts in respect of
any such leases, will take such actions and execute such documents as the
Collateral Agent shall reasonably require to confirm the Lien of a Mortgage, if
applicable, or to create a new Mortgage (including, without limitation,
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in subsections (c) and (y) of Section
4.01, if not previously fulfilled by the Borrower or such Loan Party with
respect to such new Collateral). All actions taken by the parties in connection
with the pledge of Additional Collateral, including, without limitation, costs
of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, shall be for
the account of the Borrower, which shall pay all sums due on demand.

                  SECTION 5.12. Further Assurances. The Loan Parties will, and
will cause each Restricted Subsidiary of a Loan Party to, execute any and all
further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take
all such further actions (including the filing and recording of financing
statements, fixture filings, mortgages, deeds of trust and other documents and
the delivery of appropriate opinions of counsel), which may be required under
any applicable law, or which the Administrative Agent or the Requisite Lenders
may reasonably request, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents or to grant, preserve, protect or perfect the Liens created by the
Security Documents or the validity or priority of any

                                      -91-

<PAGE>

such Lien, all at the expense of the Loan Parties. The Loan Parties also agree
to provide to the Administrative Agent, from time to time upon request, evidence
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent as to the perfection and
priority of the Liens created or intended to be created by the Security
Documents.

                  Without limiting the foregoing, the Loan Parties shall comply
with the provisions of Section 2(a) of the Pledge Agreement (regarding actions
in furtherance of perfecting the Lien of the Collateral Agent in certain
Collateral) within the time periods specified (unless extended or waived by the
Collateral Agent).

                  SECTION 5.13. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower covenants and
agrees that (i) the proceeds of the Term B Loan Borrowings hereunder will be
used on the Effective Date to pay the aggregate Per Share Amount (as defined in
the Merger Agreement) in the Merger and to pay Fees and expenses payable
hereunder, (ii) all Revolving Credit Borrowings will be used for general
corporate purposes; provided that if the proceeds thereof are used to make an
Investment, after giving effect to such Borrowing, the sum of (A) the Total
Revolving Credit Commitment less the Revolving Credit Exposure of all Revolving
Lenders, plus (B) cash and/or Permitted Investments on the latest balance sheet
of the Borrower that has been delivered to Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01(a)
or (b) (with such Permitted Investments valued at the amount set forth on such
balance sheet), shall not be less than $75.0 million and (iii) all Foreign
Currency Loans shall be advanced to one or more Non-U.S. Subsidiaries pursuant
to an Intercompany Note that is pledged to the Secured Parties pursuant to the
Security Documents.

                  SECTION 5.14. Payment of Taxes. Each Loan Party and its
respective Subsidiaries will pay and discharge all material taxes, assessments
and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or
profits, or upon any Properties belonging to it, prior to the date on which
material penalties attach thereto, and all lawful claims which, if unpaid, might
become a Lien or charge upon any Properties of such Loan Party or any of its
respective Subsidiaries or cause a failure or forfeiture of title thereto;
provided that neither such Loan Party nor any of its respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim that is
being contested in good faith and by proper proceedings diligently conducted,
which proceedings have the effect of preventing the forfeiture or sale of the
Property or asset that may become subject to such Lien, if it has maintained
adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with and to the extent
required under GAAP; provided, further, that any such contest of any tax,
assessment, charge, levy or claim with respect to Collateral shall satisfy the
Contested Collateral Lien Conditions.

                  SECTION 5.15. Equal Security for Loans and Notes. If any Loan
Party shall create or assume any Lien upon any of its property or assets,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, other than Permitted Liens (unless
prior written consent to the creation or assumption thereof shall have been
obtained from the Administrative Agent and the Requisite Lenders), it shall make
or cause to be made effective provisions whereby the Obligations will be secured
by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all other assets or Property
thereby secured as long as any such assets or Property shall be secured;
provided that this covenant shall not be construed as

                                      -92-

<PAGE>

consent by the Administrative Agent and the Requisite Lenders to any violation
by any Loan Party of the provisions of Section 6.02.

                  SECTION 5.16. Guarantees. In the event that (i) any Domestic
Subsidiary of the Borrower existing on the Effective Date has not previously
executed the Guarantee Agreement, (ii) any Person becomes a Domestic Subsidiary
of the Borrower after the Effective Date, or (iii) any Subsidiary that
Guarantees any other Indebtedness of the Borrower or any Domestic Subsidiary,
the Borrower will promptly notify the Administrative Agent of that fact and
cause such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a
counterpart of the Guarantee Agreement and deliver to the Collateral Agent a
counterpart of the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement and to take all
such further actions and execute all such further documents and instruments
(including actions, documents and certificates comparable to those described in
Sections 4.01(c), (e) and (f)) as may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion
of the Administrative Agent, desirable to create in favor of the Collateral
Agent, for the benefit itself and of the Secured Parties, a valid and perfected
first priority Lien on all of the Property and assets of such Subsidiary
described in the applicable forms of the Security Documents.

                  SECTION 5.17. Subordination of Loans. Each Loan Party
covenants and agrees that any existing and future loans from any Subsidiary that
is not a Loan Party to either of the Parent Guarantors, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary Loan Party shall be subordinated (to the extent legally permitted) to
the Obligations pursuant to a written agreement to at least the same extent as
the Subordinated Notes are subordinated to the Obligations.

                  SECTION 5.18. Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Each Loan Party shall
ensure that all financial statements of each Unrestricted Subsidiary distributed
to any creditor of an Unrestricted Subsidiary clearly states the separateness of
such Unrestricted Subsidiary from the Loan Parties.

                  SECTION 5.19. Non-Pledgeable Permitted PharmaBio Investments.
(a) Within 60 days after the Effective Date, unless otherwise extended or waived
by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion, the Borrower shall
create a newly-formed Wholly Owned Domestic Subsidiary that will become a party
to the Guarantee Agreement ("New Investment Subsidiary"), pledge 100% of the New
Investment Subsidiary's Equity Interests pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and
transfer to such New Investment Subsidiary all Permitted PharmaBio Investments
(or other securities) owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary Loan Party on the
Effective Date and that are (i) not pledged in favor of the Collateral Agent
under the Pledge Agreement and (ii) not subsequently disposed of; provided,
however, the failure to transfer any security to such New Investment Subsidiary
shall not constitute a breach of this covenant if such transfer is prohibited by
the terms of any agreement related to such security and the applicable Loan
Party has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required consents
to such transfer.

                  (b) The New Investment Subsidiary shall not conduct any
business or hold any assets or have any operations (other than holding Permitted
PharmaBio Investments (or other securities) and actions reasonably related
thereto). Each Loan Party shall promptly transfer any Permitted PharmaBio
Investments (or other securities) acquired in the future by such Loan Party

                                      -93-

<PAGE>

(other than the New Investment Subsidiary) that are by their terms not permitted
to be pledged under the Pledge Agreement to the New Investment Subsidiary;
provided, however, the failure to transfer any security to such New Investment
Subsidiary shall not constitute a breach of this covenant if such transfer is
prohibited under the terms of any agreement related to such security and the
applicable Loan Party has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
required consents to such transfer.

                  SECTION 5.20. Additional Mortgages. (a) The Loan Parties, as
appropriate, will use commercially reasonable efforts (unless waived or extended
by the Collateral Agent in its discretion) to obtain, within sixty (60) days
after the Effective Date, the property owners' consent to leasehold mortgage
financing with respect to the properties located at 475 Brannan Street, San
Francisco, CA and 10 Waterview Boulevard, Parsippany, NJ, and if such consent is
so obtained with respect to either or both of such properties, the Loan Parties,
as appropriate, will use commercially reasonably efforts to deliver within
thirty (30) days thereafter the following:

                  (i)      a duly executed and acknowledged Mortgage, financing
         statements and other instruments meeting the requirements of Section
         4.01(y)(A) hereof;

                  (ii)     such consents, approvals, amendments, supplements,
         estoppels, tenant subordination agreements or other instruments as
         required by Section 4.01(y)(B);

                  (iii)    a policy of title insurance meeting the requirements
         of Section 4.01(y)(C);

         Section 4.01(y)(D);

         4.01(y)(E);

                  (vi)     such affidavits, certificates, information (including
         financial data) and instruments of indemnification (including, without
         limitation, a so-called "gap" indemnification) as required by Section
         4.01(y)(F);

                  (vii)    evidence of payment of all applicable premiums,
         charges, costs, taxes, etc. as required by Section 4.01(y)(G);

                  (viii)   copies of all leases or other agreements, and
         subordination of such, as required by Section 4.01(y)(H);

                  (ix)     an Officers' Certificate as required by Section
         4.01(y)(I); and

                  (x)      favorable written opinions of local counsel as
         required by Section 4.01(c)(iv).

                  SECTION 5.21. Foreign Pledges. (a) Within 30 days after the
Effective Date unless otherwise extended or waived by the Collateral Agent in
its discretion, (i) the Borrower shall have authorized, executed and delivered
all documents and taken all actions necessary or appropriate to grant in favor
of the Collateral Agent a first priority pledge of 65% of the voting

                                      -94-

<PAGE>

Equity Interests and 100% of the non-voting Equity Interests in Quintiles AG

Section 4.01(w) of this Agreement, the delivery of all certificates, agreements
or instruments representing such Equity Interest of Quintiles AG, accompanied by
instruments of transfer endorsed in blank to the extent required or permitted
under the jurisdiction or organization of the applicable issuer of such Equity
Interests and the payment of all fees in connection therewith) and (ii) the
Collateral Agent shall have received, on behalf of itself, the other Agents and
the Lenders, a favorable written opinion of counsel in Switzerland as shall be
acceptable to the Collateral Agent, (a) dated no later than such 30th day after
the Effective Date, (b) addressed to the Collateral Agent and the Lenders and
(c) covering such matters relating to the Security Documents and the Loan

                                   ARTICLE VI

                               NEGATIVE COVENANTS

principal of and interest on each Loan and all Fees and other amounts payable
hereunder or under any other Loan Document have been paid in full and all
Letters of Credit have expired or terminated and all LC Disbursements shall have
been reimbursed, each of the Loan Parties and their respective Subsidiaries

                  SECTION 6.01. Indebtedness; Certain Equity Securities. (a) The
Loan Parties will not, and will not permit any of their Restricted Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or permit to exist (including
by way of Guarantee) any Indebtedness, except:

                  (i)      Indebtedness incurred and outstanding under the Loan
         Documents;

                  (ii)     (A) Indebtedness of the Loan Parties incurred and
         outstanding under the Subordinated Notes in an aggregate principal
         amount not to exceed $450 million and (B) any refinancings thereof with
         Permitted Subordinated Indebtedness; provided that in the case of this
         clause (B) only, (x) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
         or be continuing or would result therefrom, (y) after giving effect to
         the incurrence of such Indebtedness (and any other Indebtedness
         incurred since the last day of the immediately preceding Test Period)
         on a pro forma basis as if it were incurred on the first day of the
         immediately preceding Test Period (but tested as if the applicable
         ratio were the ratio for the next succeeding Test Period), the Borrower
         would be in compliance with Sections 6.13 through 6.16, inclusive, and
         (z) the amount of such Indebtedness is not increased at the time of
         such refinancing, except by an amount equal to any reasonable
         prepayment premium on such Indebtedness being refinanced and fees and
         expenses reasonably incurred in connection with such refinancing;

                  (iii)    Indebtedness existing on the Effective Date and set

         tions (other than interest rates and other terms which fluctuate with
         general market conditions) no less favorable to such Person than such
         existing Indebtedness; provided that the amount of such Indebtedness is
         not increased at the time of such refinancing, refunding, renewal or
         extension except by an amount equal to any reasonable prepayment

         Loan Party (other than Bioglan) and of any Subsidiary Loan Party to the

Disbursements or Letters of Credit are outstanding:

                  (a)      The Borrower shall default (i) in the payment when
         due of any principal of any Loan (including, without limitation, on any
         Installment Payment Date) or any reimbursement obligation in respect of
         any LC Disbursement, (ii) in the payment when due of any interest on

         described in Section 2.11 or of any other previously invoiced amount
         (other than an amount described in clauses (i) and (ii)) payable under
         this Agreement or any other Loan Document (and such default shall
         continue unremedied for a period of three Business Days).

                  (b)      Any representation or warranty of the Borrower, the
         Parent Guarantors or any other Loan Party made or deemed to be made
         hereunder or in any other Loan Document or any other writing or
         certificate furnished by or on behalf of the Parent Guarantors or any
         other Loan Party to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
         Lender for the purposes of or in connection with this Agreement or any
         such other Loan Document is or shall be incorrect in any material
         respect when made or deemed made.

                  (c)      The Borrower shall default in the due performance and
         observance of any of its obligations under clause (g), (h) or (l) of
         Section 5.01, clause (a) of Section 5.02 (with respect to the
         maintenance and preservation of the Parent Guarantors' or the
         Borrower's corporate existence) or Article VI.

                  (d)      The Borrower, the Parent Guarantors or any other Loan
         Party shall default in the due performance and observance of any
         agreement (other than those specified in paragraphs (a) through (c)
         above) contained herein or in any other Loan Document, and such default
         shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days after the date of
         such default.

                  (e)      A default shall occur (i) in the payment when due
         (subject to any applicable grace period), whether by acceleration or
         otherwise, of any Material Indebtedness or (ii) in the performance or
         observance of any obligation or condition with respect to any Material
         Indebtedness if the effect of such default referred to in this clause
         (ii) is to accelerate the maturity of any such Material Indebtedness or
         that enables or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the
         lapse of time or both) the holder or holders of any such Material
         Indebtedness or any trustee or agent on its or their behalf to cause
         any such Material Indebtedness to become due, or to require the
         prepayment, repurchase, redemption or defeasance thereof, prior to its
         scheduled maturity.

                           (iii)    there shall be any period (after any
                  applicable statutory grace period) of 10 consecutive days
                  during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment or order,
                  by reason of a pending appeal or otherwise, shall not be in

                  policy or policies of insurance (with reasonable or standard
                  deductible provisions) issued by an insurer other than an
                  Affiliate of the Borrower.

                  Party, any ERISA Affiliate or any other Person to terminate a
                  Pension Plan if, as a result of such termination, a Loan Party
                  or any ERISA Affiliate could expect to incur a liability or
                  obligation to such Pension Plan which could reasonably be
                  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                           (ii)     an ERISA Event, or event of noncompliance
                  with respect to Foreign Plans, shall have occurred that gives
                  rise to a Lien on the assets of any Loan Party or a Subsidiary
                  or, when taken together with all other ERISA Events and events
                  of noncompliance with respect to Foreign Plans that have
                  occurred, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
                  Adverse Effect.

                  (h)      Any Change in Control shall occur.

                  (i)      The Borrower, either Parent Guarantor or any of their

                  or acquiescence, permit or suffer to exist the appointment of
                  a trustee, receiver, sequestrator or other custodian for the

                  of any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement or other
                  case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or
                  any dissolution, winding up or liquidation proceeding, in
                  respect of the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or any such
                  Subsidiary and, if any such case or proceeding is not
                  commenced by the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such
                  Subsidiary, such case or proceeding shall be consented to or
                  acquiesced in by the Borrower, such Parent Guarantor or such
                  Subsidiary or shall result in the entry of an order for relief
                  or shall remain for 60 days undismissed and unstayed, provided
                  that the Borrower, each Parent Guarantor and each such
                  Subsidiary hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative
                  Agent and each Lender to appear in any court conducting any
                  such case or proceeding during such 60-day period to preserve,

                  comparable action, in the case of any other form of legal
                  entity) authorizing, or in furtherance of, any of the
                  foregoing.

                  (j)      The obligations of either Parent Guarantor under its
         Guarantee in Article IX or of any other Loan Party under the Guarantee
         Agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect or either Parent
         Guarantor or any such other Loan Party shall repudiate its obligations
         thereunder.

                  (k)      Any Lien purported to be created under any Security
         Document shall fail or cease to be (other than any Lien which is
         voluntarily released by the Collateral Agent), or shall be asserted by
         any Loan Party not to be, a valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral,
         with the priority required by the applicable Security Document, and
         such failure or cessation shall continue unremedied for five days.

                  (l)      The subordination provisions relating to the
         Subordinated Notes or any Permitted Subordinated Indebtedness (the
         "Subordination Provisions") shall fail in any material respect to be
         enforceable by the Lenders (which have not effectively waived the
         benefits thereof) in accordance with the terms thereof or the Borrower,
         the Parent Guarantors or any Subsidiary Loan Party shall, directly or
         indirectly, disavow or contest in any manner any of the Subordination
         Provisions.

the Requisite Lenders, shall by written notice to the Borrower and each Lender

theretofore terminated) shall, without notice of any kind, automatically
terminate) declare their Commitments terminated, and upon such declaration the
Lenders shall have no further obligation to make any Loans hereunder. Upon such
termination of the Commitments, all accrued fees and expenses shall be
immediately due and payable.

                                   THE AGENTS

                  SECTION 8.01. The Agents. Citicorp North America, Inc. is
hereby appointed to act as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent on behalf
of the Lenders. Each of the Lenders and each assignee of any such Lender hereby
irrevocably authorizes each of the Agents to take such actions on behalf of such
Lender or assignee and to exercise such powers as are specifically delegated to
such Agent by the terms and provisions hereof and of the other Loan Documents,
together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each
Agent is hereby expressly authorized by the Lenders, without hereby limiting any
implied authority, (a) to receive on behalf of the Lenders all payments of
principal of and interest on the Loans, all payments and all other amounts due
to the Lenders hereunder, and promptly to distribute to each Lender its proper
share of each payment so received; (b) to give notice on behalf of each of the
Lenders to the Borrower of any Default specified in this Agreement of which such
Agent has actual knowledge acquired in connection with its agency hereunder; (c)
to distribute to each Lender copies of all notices, financial statements and
other materials delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement as received
by such Agent, (d) to enter into the Security Documents on behalf of the Lenders
and (e) to claim all Obligations owed to any Lender against the Borrower in its
own name for the purpose of any Security Documents.

<PAGE>

                  None of the Agents nor any of their Related Parties shall be
liable to the Lenders as such for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any
of them except to the extent finally judicially determined to have resulted from
its or his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct, or be responsible
for any statement, warranty or representation herein or the contents of any
document delivered in connection herewith, or be required to ascertain or to
make any inquiry concerning the performance or observance by any Loan Party of
any of the terms, conditions, covenants or agreements contained in any Loan
Document. The Agents shall not be responsible to the Lenders for the due
execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or effectiveness of this
Agreement or any other Loan Documents or other instruments or agreements. Each
Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or refraining from
acting, in accordance with written instructions signed by the Requisite Lenders
(or, when expressly required hereby, all the Lenders) and, except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, such instructions and any action or inaction
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all the Lenders. Each Agent shall, in the
absence of actual knowledge to the contrary, be entitled to rely on any
instrument or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed or sent by the proper person or persons. None of the
Agents nor any of their Related Parties shall have any responsibility to the
Loan Parties on account of the failure of or delay in performance or breach by
any Lender of any of its obligations hereunder or to any Lender on account of
the failure of or delay in performance or breach by any other Lender or the Loan
Parties of any of their respective obligations hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or in connection herewith or therewith. Each Agent may execute any and
all duties hereunder by or through any of its Related Parties or any sub-agent
appointed by it and shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of legal counsel
selected by it with respect to all matters arising hereunder and shall not be
liable for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it in accordance with
the advice of such counsel.

                  The Lenders hereby acknowledge that no Agent shall be under
any duty to take any discretionary action permitted to be taken by it pursuant
to the provisions of any Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing
to do so by the Requisite Lenders.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent
as provided below, any Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders,
the Issuing Bank and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Requisite
Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor. If no successor shall have
been so appointed by the Requisite Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the
Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent which shall be a bank with an office in
New York, New York, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500.0
million or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment
as an Agent hereunder by such a successor bank, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Agent and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After an Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of
this Article and Section 10.05 shall continue in effect for its benefit in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as
an Agent.

<PAGE>

                  With respect to the Loans made by it hereunder, each Agent in
its individual capacity and not as an Agent shall have the same rights and
powers as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an
Agent, and such Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to
and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary
or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not an Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither CGMI, as a Lead Arranger, in such capacity, nor CGMI or Banc One, as
Syndication Agents, or RFC, as Documentation Agent, shall have any obligations,
duties or responsibilities, and shall incur any liabilities, under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                    GUARANTEE

                  SECTION 9.01. Guarantee of the Parent Guarantors. In order to
induce the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to make or maintain the Loans and to issue Letters of
Credit hereunder, and in consideration thereof, each of the Parent Guarantors
hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor and not
merely as surety, to the Agents, for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties,
the prompt and complete payment and performance by the Borrower when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Obligations,
and each of the Parent Guarantors further agrees to pay any and all reasonable
expenses (including, without limitation, all reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of counsel) which may be paid or incurred by the Agents, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender in enforcing any of their rights under the Guarantee
contained in this Article IX. The Guarantee contained in this Article IX,
subject to Section 9.04, shall remain in full force and effect until all Letters
of Credit have terminated, the Obligations are paid in full and the Commitments
are terminated.

                  Each of the Parent Guarantors agrees that whenever, at any
time, or from time to time, it shall make any payment to any Agent, the Issuing
Bank or any Lender on account of its liability under this Article IX, it will
notify such Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Lender in writing that such payment
is made under the Guarantee contained in this Article IX for such purpose. No
payment or payments made by the Borrower or any other Person or received or
collected by any Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender from the Borrower or any
other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any setoff or
appropriation or application, at any time or from time to time, in reduction of
or in payment of the Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce, release

                                     -119-

<PAGE>

or otherwise affect the liability of such Parent Guarantor under this Article
IX, which, notwithstanding any such payment or payments, shall remain liable for
the unpaid and outstanding Obligations until, subject to Section 9.04, all
Letters of Credit have terminated and the Obligations are paid in full and the
Commitments are terminated.

                  SECTION 9.02. Amendments, etc. with Respect to the Applicable
Obligations. Each of the Parent Guarantors shall remain obligated under this
Article IX notwithstanding that (i) without any reservation of rights against
such Parent Guarantor, and (ii) without notice to or further assent by such
Parent Guarantor, (x) any demand for payment of or reduction in the principal
amount of any of the Obligations made by the Agents, the Syndication Agents, the
Issuing Bank or any Lender may be rescinded by the Agents, the Syndication
Agents, the Issuing Bank or such Lender, (y) any of the Obligations may be
continued, and the applicable Obligations, or the liability of any other party
upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral security or guarantee therefor
or right of offset with respect thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in
part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived,
surrendered or released by the Agents, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender, and (z) this Agreement and any other documents executed and
delivered in connection herewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or
terminated, in whole or in part, as the Lenders (or the Requisite Lenders, as
the case may be) may deem advisable from time to time, and any collateral
security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the Agents, the
Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender for the payment of the
applicable Obligations may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released.
None of the Agents, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender shall
have any obligation to protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time
held by it as security for the Obligations or for the Guarantee contained in
this Article IX or any property subject thereto.

                  SECTION 9.03. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each of
the Parent Guarantors waives any and all notice of the creation, renewal,
extension or accrual of any of the Obligations and notice of or proof of
reliance by the Agents, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender
upon the Guarantee contained in this Article IX or acceptance of the Guarantee
contained in this Article IX; the Obligations, and any of them, shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred, or renewed,
extended, amended or waived, in reliance upon the Guarantee contained in this
Article IX, and all dealings between each of the Parent Guarantors, on the one
hand, and the Agents, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders,
on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been had or
consummated in reliance upon the Guarantee contained in this Article IX. The
Agents, Syndication Agents, Issuing Bank and any Lender will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, request payment of any applicable Obligation from
the Borrower before making any claim against either Parent Guarantor under this
Article IX, but will have no further obligation to proceed against the Borrower
or to defer for any period a claim against each of the Parent Guarantors
hereunder. Except as expressly provided in the preceding sentence, each of the
Parent Guarantors waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and
notice of default or nonpayment to or upon such Parent Guarantor or the Borrower
with respect to the Obligations. The Guarantee contained in this Article IX
shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of
payment without regard to (a) the validity or enforceability of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document, any of the Obligations or any collateral security

                                     -120-

<PAGE>

therefor or Guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any time or
from time to time held by any Agent, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank or
any Lender, (b) the legality under applicable laws of repayment by the Borrower
of any Obligations or the adoption of any applicable laws purporting to render
any Obligations null and void, (c) any defense, setoff or counterclaim (other
than a defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to
or be asserted by either Parent Guarantor or the Borrower against the Agents,
the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, or (d) any other
circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of either Parent
Guarantor or the Borrower) which constitutes, or might be construed to
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for any Obligations,
or of either Parent Guarantor under the Guarantee contained in this Article IX,
in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When any Agent, the Syndication Agents,
the Issuing Bank or any Lender is pursuing its rights and remedies under this
Article IX against the Parent Guarantors, such Agent, the Syndication Agents,
the Issuing Bank or such Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue
such rights and remedies as it may have against the Borrower or any other Person
or against any collateral security or Guarantee for the Obligations or any right
of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by any Agent, the Syndication
Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender to pursue such other rights or remedies
or to collect any payments from the Borrower or any such other Person or to
realize upon any such collateral security or Guarantee or to exercise any such
right of offset, or any release of the Borrower or any such other Person or of
any such collateral security, Guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve
the Parent Guarantors of any liability under this Article IX, and shall not
impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available
as a matter of law, of the Agents, the Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank and
the Lenders against the Parent Guarantors.

                  SECTION 9.04. Reinstatement. The Guarantee contained in this
Article IX shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be,
if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by any Agent, the
Syndication Agents, the Issuing Bank or any Lender upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the Borrower or upon
or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of,
or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any substantial part of its
Property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made.

                  SECTION 9.05. Payments. Each of the Parent Guarantors hereby
agrees that any payments in respect of the Obligations pursuant to this Article
IX will be paid without setoff or counterclaim in the currency in which the
applicable Loans are denominated at the office of the Administrative Agent
specified in Section 10.01.

                  SECTION 9.06. Independent Obligations. The obligations of each
of the Parent Guarantors under the Guarantee contained in this Article IX are
independent of the obligations of the Borrower, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against each of the Parent Guarantors whether or
not the Borrower is joined in any such action or actions. Each of the Parent
Guarantors waives, to the full extent permitted by law, the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement
thereof. Any pay-

                                     -121-

ment by the Borrower or other circumstance which operates to toll any statute of
limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations
as to the Parent Guarantors.

with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be
considered to have been relied upon by Lenders hereto and shall survive the
making by the Lenders of the Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit,
regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf
and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or
incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal
of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any Fee or any other amount payable
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document is outstanding and unpaid or any
Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not been
terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 10.05 and 10.16 and
Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 10.03. Binding Effect. Subject to Section 4.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall
have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
permitted successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 10.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) Whenever in this
Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be
deemed to include the permitted successors and assigns of such party (including
any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Let-

                                     -123-

<PAGE>

ter of Credit). All covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the
Borrower, the Agents or the Lenders that are contained in this Agreement shall
bind and inure to the benefit of their respective successors and assigns.
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer
upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and
assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent provided in clause (f)
below and, solely to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related
Parties of each of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all
or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it); provided, however, that (i) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender
or a Lender Affiliate or in connection with the initial syndication of the
Commitments and Loans, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (and, in the
case of any assignment of a Revolving Credit Commitment or any Lender's
obligations in respect of its LC Exposure, Swingline Exposure or Foreign
Currency Exposure, the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender and the Foreign
Currency Lenders, as applicable) must give their prior written consent to such
assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (ii)
except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or a Lender Affiliate or in
connection with the initial syndication of the Commitments and Loans, the amount
of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less
than, in the case of the Term B Loans, $1.0 million and increments of $1.0
million in excess thereof and, in the case of the Revolving Loans, $5.0 million
and increments of $1.0 million in excess thereof (or (A) if the aggregate amount
of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender is a lesser amount, the
entire amount of such Commitment or Loans, or (B) in any other case, such lesser
amount as the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise agree), (iii) each
partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all
the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, except that
this clause (iii) shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in
respect of one Class of Commitments and Loans, (iv) except in the case of the
assignment to a Lender Affiliate of such Lender or an assignment required to be
made pursuant to Section 2.21, the parties to each such assignment shall execute
and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 and, if applicable, the forms
required by Section 2.17(c) hereof, and (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire; provided, further, that any consent of the Borrower otherwise
required under this paragraph shall not be required if a Default or an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing. Subject to acceptance and recording
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section 10.04, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be
at least five Business Days after the execution thereof (unless otherwise
determined by the Administrative Agent), (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and (B) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations
under this Agree-

                                     -124-

<PAGE>

ment (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or the
remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.16, 2.17, 2.18 and 10.05 with respect to
facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment, as well as to any Fees accrued for its account and not yet paid).
Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes
of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (f) of this Section.

                  (c)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the assigning Lender thereunder and the assignee thereunder shall be
deemed to confirm to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as
follows: (i) such assigning Lender warrants that it is the legal and beneficial
owner of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim
and that its Commitment, and the outstanding balances of its Loans and
participations in Swingline Loans, in each case without giving effect to
assignments thereof which have not become effective, are as set forth in such
Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) except as set forth in (i) above, such assigning
Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with
respect to any statements, warranties or representations made in or in
connection with this Agreement, or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto, or
the financial condition of the Borrower or any Subsidiary or the performance or
observance by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of any of its obligations under
this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee represents and warrants that it
is legally authorized to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such
assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with
copies of the most recent financial statements, if any, delivered pursuant to
Section 5.01 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (v) such assignee will independently and without
reliance upon either Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes each Agent to take
such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this
Agreement as are delegated to such Agent by the terms hereof and any other Loan
Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; (vii)
such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
it as a Lender; and (viii) Schedule 2.01 shall be deemed to be amended to
reflect the reduction of commitment of or deletion of the assigning Lender
thereunder and the commitment of the assignee thereunder after giving effect
thereto.

                  (d)      The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as
an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in the City of
New York a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements, and
participations in Swingline Loans, owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from

                                     -125-

<PAGE>

time to time (the "Register"). Except to the extent inconsistent with Section
2.08(d), the entries in the Register shall be conclusive and the Borrower, the
Agents, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and
any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

                  (e)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, an Administrative
Questionnaire completed in respect of the assignee (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) above and, if required, the written consent of the Borrower,
the Issuing Bank, the Swingline Lender, the Foreign Currency Lenders and the
Administrative Agent to such assignment, the Administrative Agent shall (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. No
assignment shall be effective unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph (e).

                  (f)      Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrower,
the Swingline Lender, the Foreign Currency Lender, the Issuing Bank or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than a natural
person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Affiliates or Subsidiaries)
(each, a "Participant") in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing
to it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) each Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of the cost protection
provisions contained in Sections 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18 and the provisions of
Section 5.01 to the same extent as if they were Lenders and had acquired its
interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 10.04 (provided
that no participant shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to
such Sections than the Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of
the interest transferred unless either (x) such transfer to such Participant is
made with the Borrower's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld)
or (y) a Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such participation), and (iv) the Borrower, the Agents, the Issuing Bank
and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, and
such Lender shall retain the sole right (which each Lender agrees will not be
limited by the terms of any participation agreement or other agreement with a
participant) to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents (other than,
without the consent of the Participant, amendments, modifications or waivers
described in the first proviso of Section 10.08(b) that affect such
Participant). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 10.06 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.21 as though it were a
Lender.

                  (g)      Any Lender or participant may, in connection with any
assignment or participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to
this Section 10.04, disclose to the

                                     -126-

<PAGE>

assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant any information
relating to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries furnished to such Lender by or on
behalf of any of the Loan Parties; provided that, prior to any such disclosure
of information designated by the Borrower as confidential, each such assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant shall execute a confidentiality
agreement in form and substance consistent with provisions of Section 10.16.

                  (h)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank and this Section 10.04 shall not apply to
any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that (x) no such
pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of
its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such
Lender as a party hereto and (y) any foreclosure or similar action shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.04(b) concerning assignments and shall
not be effective to transfer any rights under this Agreement or in any Loan,
Note or other instrument evidencing the rights of a Lender under this Agreement
until the requirements of Section 10.04(b) concerning assignments are fully
satisfied. In order to facilitate such a pledge or assignment, the Borrower
shall, at the request of the assigning Lender, duly execute and deliver to the
assigning Lender a promissory note or notes evidencing the Loans made to the
Borrower by the assigning Lender hereunder.

                  (i)      The Borrower shall not assign or delegate any of its
rights or duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, and any attempted assignment without such
consent shall be null and void.

                  SECTION 10.05. Expenses; Indemnity. (a) The Loan Parties
agree, jointly and severally, to pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, CGMI and its
Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of Cahill
Gordon & Reindel LLP, counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation
and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in
connection with any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions
hereof or thereof (whether or not the transactions hereby contemplated shall be
consummated), (ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing
Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any
Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lead Arranger, the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement
(including its rights under this Section), the other Loan Documents or the Loans
made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket
expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect
of such Loans or Letters of Credit, and, in connection with any such enforcement
or protection, the fees, charges and disbursements of any other counsel for the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Lead Arranger, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender; provided, however, that the Loan Parties shall not be obligated
to pay for expenses incurred by a Lender in connection with the assignment of
Loans to an assignee Lender (except pursuant to Section 2.21) or the sale of
Loans to a participant pursuant to Section 10.04.

<PAGE>

                  (b)      Each of the Loan Parties, jointly and severally,
agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the
Syndication Agents, the Documentation Agent, the Lead Arranger, the Issuing
Bank, each Lender, each Affiliate of any of the foregoing Persons and each of
their respective Related Parties (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee")
against, and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and related reasonable expenses, including reasonable
counsel fees, charges and disbursements, incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnitee arising out of, in any way connected with or as a result of (i) the
execution or delivery of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any
agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties
hereto or thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation
of the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) the
use of the proceeds of the Loans or Letters of Credit (including any refusal by
the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the
documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with
the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether or not any Indemnitee is
a party thereto, or (iv) any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous
Materials on any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability or Environmental Claim related in
any way to the Borrower or the Subsidiaries; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related reasonable expenses are finally judicially
determined to have arisen by reason of the Indemnitee's gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

                  (c)      To the extent that the Loan Parties fail to promptly
pay any amount to be paid by them to any Agent, the Lead Arranger, the Issuing
Bank, the Foreign Currency Lender or the Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to such Agent, the
Issuing Bank, Foreign Currency Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may
be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount
(other than syndication expenses); provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may
be, was incurred by or asserted against the applicable Agent, the Lead Arranger,
the Issuing Bank, Foreign Currency Lender or the Swingline Lender in its
capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be
determined based upon its share of the sum of the total Revolving Credit
Exposures, outstanding Term B Loans and unused Commitments at the time.

                  (d)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Loan
Parties shall not assert, and hereby waive, any claim against any Indemnitee, on
any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use
of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e)      The provisions of this Section 10.05 shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of the expiration of the term
of this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of any of the Loans, the expiration of the Commitments, the invalidity
or unenforceability of any term or provision of this Agreement or

                                     -128-

<PAGE>

any other Loan Document, or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender. All amounts due under this Section 10.05
shall be payable on written demand therefor.

                  SECTION 10.06. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default or
Event of Termination shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other Indebtedness at
any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement and other Loan Documents held by such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this
Agreement or such other Loan Document and although such obligations may be
unmatured. In connection with exercising its rights pursuant to the previous
sentence, a Lender may at any time use any of the Borrower's credit balances
with the Lender to purchase at the Lender's applicable spot rate of exchange any
other currency or currencies which the Lender considers necessary to reduce or
discharge any amount due by the Borrower to the Lender, and may apply that
currency or those currencies in or towards payment of those amounts. The rights
of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Each Lender
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after making
any such setoff.

                  SECTION 10.07. Applicable Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS) SHALL
BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

                  SECTION 10.08. Waivers; Amendment. (a) No failure or delay of
either Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any power or right
hereunder or under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agents, the Issuing Bank and the
Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. No waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) below, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default
or Event of Default regardless of whether an Agent, any Lender or the Issuing
Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the
time. No notice or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower
to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

                  (b)      Neither this Agreement, any other Loan Document nor
any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in
the case of this Agreement,

                                     -129-

<PAGE>

pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower
and the Requisite Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant
to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Agent and the Loan
Party or Loan Parties or other Persons that are parties thereto, in each case
with the consent of the Requisite Lenders; provided, however, that no such
agreement shall (i) decrease the principal amount of any Loan or LC
Disbursement, or extend the final scheduled maturity date or any Installment
Payment Date of the Loans or date for the payment of any interest on any Loan or
the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or waive or excuse
any such payment or any part thereof, or decrease the rate of interest on any
Loan or LC Disbursement, or postpone the scheduled date of termination of any
Commitment, without the prior written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(ii) change or extend the Commitment, Foreign Currency Sublimit or Maximum
Foreign Currency Sublimit or decrease the Commitment Fee or LC Fee of any Lender
without the prior written consent of such Lender, (iii) amend or modify the
provisions of Section 2.14, the provisions of this Section, the definition of
"Requisite Lenders," or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive,
amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any
consent thereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (or each
Lender of such Class, as the case may be), (iv) release any Loan Party from its
Guarantee under Article IX or a Guarantee Agreement (except as expressly
provided herein or in such Guarantee Agreement), or limit its liability in
respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender, (v)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents (except as expressly provided in this Agreement or the
Security Documents) or subordinate the Liens under any Security Document,
without the written consent of each Lender, (vi) amend Section 3.01 of the
Collateral Sharing Agreement without the written consent of each Lender or (vii)
change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its terms
adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding Loans
of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class, without
the written consent of Lenders holding a majority interest of the outstanding
Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided, further, that no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of
either Agent, the Lead Arranger, the Issuing Bank, Foreign Currency Lender or
the Swingline Lender hereunder or under any other Loan Document without the
prior written consent of such Agent, the Lead Arranger, the Issuing Bank,
Foreign Currency Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be; provided,
further, that (x) with respect to (i) any change to Section 2.06(c), (ii) any
change to Section 2.06(g) or (iii) any amendment that changes the application of
any optional or mandatory prepayments of the Loans to the remaining amortization
payments under the Term B Loans, the consent of Term B Lenders representing more
than 50% of the outstanding Term B Loans shall be required, (y) the consent of
the Requisite Revolving Lenders shall be required with respect to any express
amendment, modification, supplement or waiver of any condition precedent in
Section 4.02 to any Revolving Credit Borrowing and (z) the consent of the
Requisite Foreign Currency Lenders shall be required for any modification of
Section 2.04 and any change to the definition of "Foreign Currency Lenders" or
"Foreign Currency Ratable Portion" or any related definitions.

                  (c)      A Revolving Lender may allocate any proportion of its
Revolving Credit Commitment or Revolving Credit Exposure with respect to any
waiver, amendment, modifica-

                                     -130-

tion, consent or any other action pursuant to this Section 10.08 or any other
Loan Document in order to vote separate portions thereof differently with
respect thereto.

                  SECTION 10.09. Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to
any Loan, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as
interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall
exceed the maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for,
charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan or
participation in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in
respect of such Loan or participation hereunder, together with all Charges
payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the
extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect
of such Loan or participation but were not payable as a result of the operation
of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such
Lender in respect of other Loans or participations or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

                  SECTION 10.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents constitute the entire contract between the parties relative to
the subject matter hereof. Any previous agreement among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof is superseded by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents; provided that any letter agreement relating to the subject matter
hereof between the Borrower and a Lender shall remain effective in accordance
with its terms. Nothing in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party other than the
parties hereto and thereto any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

                  SECTION 10.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. EACH PARTY
HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT,
IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER

its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court or
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may
otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of
any jurisdiction.

                  (b)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally

objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents in any New York State or Federal court referred to in paragraph
(a) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

                  (c)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

from the commencement of discussions with respect to the facilities established
by this Agreement (the "Facilities"), permitted to disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the structure and "tax aspects" (as
such terms are used in Code Sections 6011, 6111 and 6112 and the regulations
promulgated thereunder) of the Facilities, and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are or have been provided to the
Loan Parties, such Lender, the Administrative Agent or the Syndication Agents
related to such structure and tax aspects. In this regard, each of the Loan
Parties, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agents
acknowledges and agrees that its disclosure of the structure or tax aspects of

or agreement, oral or written (whether or not such understanding or agreement is
legally binding). Furthermore, each of the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Syndication Agents acknowledges and agrees that it
does not know or have reason to know that its use or disclosure of information
relating to the structure or tax aspects of the Facilities is limited in any
other manner (such as where the Facilities are claimed to be proprietary or
exclusive) for the benefit of any other Person. To the extent that disclosure of
the structure or tax aspects of the Facilities by the Loan Parties, the
Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents or the Lenders is limited by any
existing agreement between the Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agents or the Lenders, such limitation is agreed to be void ab
initio and such agreement is hereby amended to permit disclosure of the
structure and tax aspects of the Facilities as provided in this paragraph (a).

                  (b)      Subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 10.16, none
of the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents or any Lender may disclose
to any Person any confidential, proprietary or non-public information of the
Loan Parties furnished to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents or
the Lenders by the Loan Parties (such information being referred to collectively
herein as the "Loan Party Information"), except that each of the Administrative
Agent, the Syndication Agents and the Lenders may disclose Loan Party
Information (i) to its and its affiliates' employees, officers, directors,
agents, accountants, attorneys and other advisors (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Loan Party Information and instructed to keep such Loan Party
Information confidential on substantially the same terms as provided herein),
(ii) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (iii) to the extent
required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal
process, (iv) to any other party to this Agreement, (v) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (vi) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section 10.16(b),
to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or
Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (vii) to
the extent such Loan Party Information (A) is or becomes generally available to
the public on a nonconfidential basis other than as a result of a breach of this
Section 10.16(b) by any party to this Agreement, or (B) is or becomes available
to the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agents or such Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Loan Parties and (viii) with
the consent of the Loan Parties. Nothing in this provision shall imply that any
party has waived any privilege it may have with respect to advice it has
received.

THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS
OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM

KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY
OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF
THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE
AGENT PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT
SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ADVISORS OR REPRESENTATIVES
(COLLECTIVELY, "AGENT PARTIES") HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE LOAN PARTIES, ANY
LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THE

HAVE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM SUCH AGENT PARTY'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT.

                  The Administrative Agent agrees that the receipt of the
Communications by the Agent at its e-mail address set forth above shall
constitute effective delivery of the Communications to the Administrative Agent
for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as
provided in the next sentence) specifying that the Communications have been
posted to the Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications
to such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees (i) to
notify the Administrative Agent in writing (including by electronic
communication) from time to time of such Lender's e-mail address to which the
foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the
foregoing notice may be sent to such e-mail address.

                  Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative
Agent or any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any
Loan Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.

                  SECTION 10.18. Collateral Agent as Joint Creditor. Each of the
Loan Parties and each of the Lenders agree that the Collateral Agent shall be
the joint creditor (together with the relevant Lender) of each and every
obligation of the Loan Parties towards each of the Lenders under or in
connection with the Loan Documents, and that accordingly the Collateral Agent
will have its own independent right to demand performance by the Loan Parties of
those obligations. However, any discharge of any such obligation to the
Collateral Agent or the relevant Lender shall, to the same extent, discharge the
corresponding obligation owing to the other.

                  SECTION 10.19. Currency of Payment. (a) Each payment owing by
the Borrower hereunder shall be made in the relevant currency specified herein
or, if not specified herein, specified in any other Loan Document executed by
the Administrative Agent (the "Currency of Payment") at the place specified
herein (such requirement is of the essence of this Agreement). If, for the
purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due
hereunder in a Currency of Payment into another currency, the parties hereto
agree that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with
normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase such Currency
of Payment with such other currency at the spot rate of exchange quoted by the
Administrative Agent at 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on the Business Day preceding
that on which final judgment is given, for delivery two Business Days
thereafter. The obligations in respect of any sum due hereunder to any Secured
Party shall, notwithstanding any adjudication expressed in a currency other than
the Currency of Payment, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business
Day following receipt by such Secured Party of any sum adjudged to be so due in
such other currency, such Secured Party may, in accordance with normal banking
procedures, purchase the Currency of Payment with such other currency. The
Borrower agrees that (a) if the amount of the Currency of Payment so purchased
is less than the sum originally due to such Secured Party in the Currency of
Payment, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding the result of any such
adjudication, the Borrower shall immediately pay the shortfall (in the Currency
of Payment) to such Secured Party and (b) if the amount of the Currency of
Payment so purchased exceeds the sum originally due to such

                                     -135-

<PAGE>

Secured Party, such Secured Party shall promptly pay the excess over to the
Borrower in the currency and to the extent actually received.

                  (b)      The Obligations owing to any Secured Party hereunder
shall, notwithstanding any payment in a currency other than the Currency of
Payment and notwithstanding any deemed conversion or replacement hereunder, be
discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by
such Secured Party of any amount in such other currency, such Secured Party may,
in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase the Currency of Payment
with such other currency. The Borrower agrees that (i) if the amount of the
Currency of Payment so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such
Secured Party in the Currency of Payment, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding the result of any such adjudication, the Borrower shall
immediately pay the shortfall (in the Currency of Payment) to such Secured Party
and (ii) if the amount of the Currency of Payment so purchased exceeds the sum
originally due to such Secured Party, such Secured Party shall promptly pay the
excess over to the Borrower in the currency and to the extent actually received.

                  SECTION 10.20. Relationship of Banc One Mezzanine Corporation.

                  (a)      Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
acknowledges that Banc One Mezzanine Corporation is a subsidiary of Bank One
Corporation, as is OEP, (b) consents to these multiple roles, and further
acknowledges that the fact that OEP and the Borrower are affiliates of Banc One
Mezzanine Corporation does not mean that any action taken or proposal made by
OEP or the Borrower (i) is acceptable to Banc One Mezzanine Corporation in its
capacity as Co-Syndication Agent or Lender hereunder, (ii) is consistent with
the terms of this Agreement or (iii) is or will be acceptable to any other
Lenders, and (c) Banc One Mezzanine Corporation shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of information known to the Borrower or OEP simply because they are
affiliates.
