resolution of any controversies or claims between the
parties, whether arising in contract, tort or by statute,
including but not limited to controversies or claims that
arise out of or relate to: (i)&nbsp;this agreement (including any
renewals, extensions or modifications); or (ii)&nbsp;any document
related to this agreement (collectively a &#147;Claim&#148;). For the
purposes of this Dispute Resolution Provision only, the term
&#147;parties&#148; shall include any parent corporation, subsidiary
or affiliate of the Bank involved in the servicing,
management or administration of any obligation described or
evidenced by this agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 8%">(b)&nbsp;At the request of any party to this agreement, any
Claim shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance
with the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9, U.S. Code) (the
&#147;Act&#148;). The Act will apply even though this agreement
provides that it is governed by the law of a specified
state.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Arbitration proceedings will be determined in
accordance with the Act, the then-current rules and
procedures for the arbitration of financial services
disputes of the American Arbitration Association or any
successor thereof (&#147;AAA&#148;), and the terms of this Dispute
Resolution Provision. In the event of any inconsistency,
the terms of this Dispute Resolution Provision shall

provider of arbitration or (ii)&nbsp;enforce any provision of
this arbitration clause, the Bank may designate another
arbitration organization with similar procedures to serve as
the provider of arbitration.

conducted, unless otherwise required by law, in any U.S.
state where real or tangible personal property collateral
for this credit is located or if there is no such
collateral, in the state specified in the governing law
section of this agreement. All Claims shall be determined by
one arbitrator; however, if Claims exceed Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000), upon the request of any party, the
Claims shall be decided by three arbitrators. All
arbitration hearings shall commence within ninety (90)&nbsp;days
of the demand for arbitration and close within ninety (90)
days of commencement and the award of the arbitrator(s)
shall be issued within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of the close of the
hearing. However, the arbitrator(s), upon a showing of good
cause, may extend the commencement of the hearing for up to
an additional sixty (60)&nbsp;days. The arbitrator(s) shall

award. The arbitration award may be

limitation in determining any Claim and may dismiss the
arbitration on the basis that the Claim is barred. For
purposes of the application of any statutes of limitation,
the service on AAA under applicable AAA rules of a notice of
Claim is the equivalent of the filing of a lawsuit. Any
dispute concerning this arbitration provision or whether a
Claim is arbitrable shall be determined by the
arbitrator(s), except as set forth at subparagraph (h)&nbsp;of
this Dispute Resolution Provision. The arbitrator(s) shall
have the power to award legal fees pursuant to the terms of
this agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 8%">(f)&nbsp;This paragraph does not limit the right of any party
to: (i)&nbsp;exercise self-help remedies, such as but not limited
to, setoff; (ii)&nbsp;initiate judicial or non-judicial
foreclosure against any real or personal property
collateral; (iii)&nbsp;exercise any judicial or power of sale
rights, or (iv)&nbsp;act in a court of law to obtain an interim
remedy, such as but not limited to, injunctive relief, writ

Provision, the validity and effect of the Class&nbsp;Action
Waiver may be determined only by a court and not by an
arbitrator. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that
the Class&nbsp;Action Waiver is material and essential to the
arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is
nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate Claims. If the
Class&nbsp;Action Waiver is limited, voided or found
unenforceable, then the parties&#146; agreement to arbitrate
shall be null and void with respect to such proceeding,
subject to the right to appeal the limitation or
invalidation of the Class&nbsp;Action Waiver. <B>The Parties
acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a
class action be arbitrated.</B>

without intending in any way to limit this agreement to

parties irrevocably and voluntarily waive any right they may
have to a trial by jury in respect of such Claim. This
waiver of jury trial shall remain in
