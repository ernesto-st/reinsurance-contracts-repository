<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Eligibility  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>You

that was available to active Salaried Employees and Certain Bargained for Employees; provided that with respect to Retired Bargained-For Employees, the applicable bargaining agreement
provides that you are eligible for coverage under this Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are a former Salaried Employee receiving a Disability Retirement Benefit from the Dow Employees' Pension Plan ("DEPP"), as defined under DEPP, and you were covered under The Dow

are also eligible if you are a "Retired Split Dollar Participant". For the definition of "Retired Split Dollar Participant", see section of this SPD entitled
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Special Rules for Retired Split Dollar Participants"</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you are covered under The Dow Chemical Company Group Life Insurance Program's Union Carbide Subsidiary Basic Life Insurance Plan, you are not eligible for coverage under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you do not meet the above eligibility criteria, check the Plan Document for additional eligible retiree populations. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Plan Administrator determines eligibility. The Plan Administrator is a fiduciary to the Plan and has the full discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings
of fact. Interpretations and eligibility determination by the Plan Administrator are final and binding on Participants. </FONT></P>

percentage of your benefit that each beneficiary is to receive. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If

proceeds at this important time could help ease financial and emotional burdens. In order to use ABO, you must be covered for at least $10,000 from your Retiree Company-Paid Life
Insurance and/or Retiree Optional Life Insurance. You may receive an accelerated benefit of up to 50&nbsp;percent (minimum $5,000 and maximum $250,000) of your Retiree Company-Paid Life
Insurance and/or Retiree Optional Life Insurance if, as a result of an injury or sickness you are diagnosed as terminally ill, with six months or less to live, and from which there is no reasonable
prospect of recovery. A claim form can be obtained from the Dow Benefits Center and must be completed and returned for evaluation and approval by MetLife. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Plan is funded by an insurance policy underwritten by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company ("MetLife"). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except
for Plan Option I, the Participating Employers pay the entire cost of the Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan. For Plan Option I, the Retiree and the
Participating Employer share the cost. The insurance carrier underwriting the Plans may combine the experience for the policy with other policies held by Dow. This means that the costs of these
coverages may be determined on a combined basis, and the costs accumulated from year to year. Favorable experience under one ore more coverages in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience
on other coverages in the same year or offset unfavorable experience of coverages in prior years. Policy dividends declared by the insurer for the Retiree Company-Paid Life Insurance Plan
attributable to Dow's premiums are used to reduce Dow's cost for the coverage in the same and prior years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Your Rights  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>You
have certain rights under the Plan and are entitled to certain information by law. Be sure to review the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Filing a Claim</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> section, </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Appealing a Denial of Claims</I></FONT><FONT

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Coverage Levels  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record was covered under your Dependent Life
Insurance Plan on the day preceding your Retirement, you may continue coverage equal to $5,000. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Dependent Children:</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any Dependent child who was covered under your Dependent Life Insurance Plan on the day preceding your Retirement,
you may continue coverage equal to $1,000, as long as he or she continues to meet eligibility requirements. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Cost  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>You
pay the premium for coverage. Your premium for Retiree Dependent Life Insurance is based on the option that you select. The cost for coverage is subject to change, according to Plan experience.
Premiums are subject to change. If your premiums are not automatically deducted from payments from the Dow Employees' Pension Plan (DEPP) or the Union Carbide Employees' Pension Plan ("UCEPP"), you
must pay your premium within 31&nbsp;days of your bill. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If your payment is not postmarked within 31&nbsp;days of your bill, your coverage will be

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Beneficiary Designation  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>You
are the beneficiary of the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan. This cannot be changed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Benefit Payment  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>In
the event of the death of your Spouse of Record/Domestic Partner of Record or Dependent child, contact the Retiree Service Center and present a certified copy of your death certificate of your
Dependent. See </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Claims Procedures Appendix</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of this SPD. Your benefit will be paid in a lump sum. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Funding  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Retirees
pay the entire premium for coverage. The benefits under the Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan are not combined for experience with the other
insurance coverages. Favorable experience under this insurance coverage in a particular year may offset unfavorable experience in prior years. It is not anticipated that there will be any future
dividends declared for the Retiree Optional Life Insurance Plan and the Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plan based on the manner in which the insurer has determined the premium rates. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Joint Insurance Arrangement  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Dorinco
Reinsurance Company (Dorinco) and MetLife have entered into an arrangement that has been approved by the U.S. Department of Labor in DOL Opinion Letter 97-24A. Under this
arrangement, MetLife has or will write the coverage for the Plan, and Dorinco will assume a percentage of the risk. Under the insurance arrangement between MetLife and Dorinco, MetLife and Dorinco
will each be liable to pay the agreed upon percentage of each death benefit claim in respect of a Plan Participant. When a claim for benefits is approved, Dorinco will transfer its percentage of each
death benefit claim to MetLife. MetLife will then pay the full amount of the claim. If MetLife is financially unable to pay the portion of the claim, Dorinco will be obligated to pay the full amount
of the claim directly. Similarly, if Dorinco is financially unable to pay its designated percentage of a particular claim, MetLife will be obligated to pay the entire amount of the claim. Neither
MetLife nor Dorinco will charge the Plan any administrative fees, commissions or other consideration as a result of the participation of Dorinco. </FONT></P>

you feel you are entitled under these Plans, or if you you feel that the Plan Administrator has denied you any right you feel that you have under these Plans, you must notify the Plan Administrator
(listed in the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>ERISA Information</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" section of this SPD) in writing within 90&nbsp;days of the date of the alleged wrongdoing. The Plan Administrator
will investigate the allegation and respond to you in writing within 120&nbsp;days. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation has merit, the Plan Administrator will either correct
the wrong (if it was the Plan which did the wrong), or will make a recommendation to the Plan Sponsor or Participating Employer if any of them have been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing.
If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation is without merit, you may appeal the Plan Administrator's decision. You must submit written notice of your appeal to the Plan Administrator
within 60&nbsp;days of receipt of the Plan Administrator's decision. Your appeal will be reviewed and you will receive a written response within 60&nbsp;days, unless special circumstances require
an extension of time. (The Plan Administrator will give you written notice and reason for the extension.) In no event should the decision take longer than 120&nbsp;days after receipt of your appeal.

<P><FONT SIZE=2>When
you are a Participant in the Retiree Company-Paid, Retiree Optional or Retiree Dependent Life Insurance Plans, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). This law requires that all Plan Participants must be able to: </FONT></P>

<UL>
<DL compact>
<DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Examine,
without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, the Plan Documents and the latest annual reports filed with the U.S. Department
of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Obtain,
upon written request to the Plan Administrator, copies of the Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions. The Administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the
copies.
<BR><BR></FONT></DD><DT style='margin-bottom:-11pt;'><FONT SIZE=2>&#149;</FONT></DT><DD><FONT SIZE=2>Receive
a summary of each Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this summary annual report. </FONT></DD></DL>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition to creating rights for you and all other Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties on the people who are responsible for operating an employee benefit plan. The people who
operate the Plans, called "fiduciaries" of the Plans, have a duty to act prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No
one, including your employer or any other person, may discharge you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a Plan benefit, or from exercising
your rights under ERISA. If you have a claim for benefits that is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the
decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
ERISA, there are steps you can take to enforce the legal rights described above. For instance, if you request materials from one of the Plans and do not receive them within
30&nbsp;days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the
materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you must
file&nbsp;a written appeal within the time period specified in the Plan's Claims Procedures. Failure to comply with the Plan's claims procedures may significantly jeopardize your rights to benefits.
If you are not satisfied with the final appellate decision, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within 120&nbsp;days from the
date of the Claims Administrator's or the Plan Administrator's final written decision (or the deadline the Claims Administrator or Plan Administrator had to notify you of a decision). Failure to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> The court will decide who should pay court costs and
legal fees. If you are successful the court may order the person you have sued to pay these costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if it finds
your claim is frivolous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it should happen that plan fiduciaries misuse one of the Plan's money, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a Federal court. </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so within
120&nbsp;days from the date of the alleged misuse. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will
result in your waiver of your right to file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you feel that anyone is discriminating against you for exercising your rights under this benefit plan, or if you feel that someone has interfered with the attainment of any right to
which you feel you are entitled under any of the Plans, you must notify the Plan Administrator listed in the "ERISA Information" section of this SPD in writing within 120&nbsp;days of the date of
the alleged wrongdoing. The Plan Administrator will investigate the allegation and respond to you in writing within 120&nbsp;days. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation has
merit, the Plan Administrator will either correct the wrong, if it was the Plan which did the wrong, or will make a recommendation to the Plan Sponsor or Participating Employer if any of them have
been alleged to be responsible for the wrongdoing. If the Plan Administrator determines that your allegation is without merit, you may appeal the Plan Administrator's decision. You must submit written
notice of your appeal to the Plan Administrator within 60&nbsp;days of receipt of the Plan Administrator's decision. Your appeal will be reviewed and you will receive a written response within
60&nbsp;days. If you are not satisfied with the Plan Administrator's response to your appeal, you may file suit in Federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>You Must File&nbsp;a Claim in Accordance with These Claims Procedures  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A
"Claim" is a <U>written</U> request by a claimant for a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Plan benefit</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> or an </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility
Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. There are two kinds of Claims: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>A </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Claim for Plan Benefits</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a request for benefits covered under the Plan. </FONT></P>

<UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>An
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Eligibility Determination</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> is a kind of Claim. It is a request for a determination as to whether a claimant is eligible to be a Participant or covered
Dependent under the Plan. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
must follow the claims procedures for either </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS or CLAIMS FOR AN ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, whichever applies to
your situation. See page 26 for the procedures for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>. See page 26 for procedures for </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>CLAIMS FOR
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Who Will Decide Whether to Approve or Deny My Claim?  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Dow Chemical Company will approve or deny a Claim for an Eligibility Determination. The initial determination is made by the Dow Benefit Center. If you appeal, the appellate decision is made by
the Director of Global Benefits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MetLife
will approve or deny a Claim for Plan Benefits. MetLife is the Claims Administrator for both the initial determination and (if there is an appeal), the appellate determination. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>An Authorized Representative May Act on Your Behalf  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>An
Authorized Representative may submit a Claim on behalf of a Plan Participant. The Plan will recognize a person as a Plan Participant's "Authorized Representative" if such person submits a notarized
writing signed by the Participant stating that the Authorized Representative is authorized to act on behalf of such Participant. A court order stating that a person is authorized to submit Claims on
behalf of a Participant will also be recognized by the Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Authority of the Administrators and Your Rights Under ERISA  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Administrators have the full, complete, and final discretion to interpret the provisions of the Plan and to make findings of fact in order to carry out their respective Claims decision-making
responsibilities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interpretations
and claims decisions by the Administrators are final and binding on Participants. If you are not satisfied with an Administrator's final appellate decision, you may
file&nbsp;a civil action against the Plan under s. 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in a federal court. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>If you file&nbsp;a lawsuit, you must do so
within 120&nbsp;days from the date of the Administrator's final written decision. Failure to file&nbsp;a lawsuit within the 120&nbsp;day period will result in your waiver of your right to
file&nbsp;a lawsuit.</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>CLAIMS FOR PLAN BENEFITS  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Information Required In Order to Be a "Claim":  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>For
Claims that are requests for Plan benefits, the claimant must complete a MetLife claims form. Call the Retiree Service Center to obtain a form&nbsp;1-800/344-0661. In
addition, you must attach a certified death certificate (must be certified by the government authority, as exhibited by a "raised seal" on the certificate). You may request assistance from the Dow
Benefits Center (1-989/636-9556) if you need help completing the MetLife claims form. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may submit any additional information to the applicable Administrator when you submit your request for appeal. You may also request that the Administrator provide you copies of
documents, records and other information that is relevant to your Claim, as determined by the applicable Administrator under applicable federal regulations. Your request must be in writing. Such
information will be provided at no cost to you. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
the applicable Administrator receives your written request to appeal the initial determination, the Administrator will review your Claim. Deference will not be given to the initial
adverse decision, and the appellate reviewer will look at the Claim anew. The person who will review your appeal will not be the same person as the person who made the initial decision to deny the
Claim. In addition, the person who is reviewing the appeal will not be a subordinate who reports to the person who made the initial decision to deny the Claim. The Administrator will notify you in
writing of its final decision. Such notification will be provided within a reasonable period, not to exceed 60&nbsp;days of the written request for appellate review, except that under special
circumstances, the Administrator may have up to an additional 60&nbsp;days to provide written notification of the final decision. If the Administrator needs such an extension, it will notify you
prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, state the reason why such an extension is needed, and indicate when it will make its determination. If the Administrator determines that it
does not have sufficient information to make a decision on the Claim prior to the expiration of the initial 60&nbsp;day period, it will notify you. It will describe any additional material or
information necessary to submit to the Plan, and provide you with the deadline for submitting such information. The initial 60&nbsp;day time period for the Administrator to make a final written
decision, plus the 60&nbsp;day extension period (if applicable) are tolled from the date the notification of insufficiency is sent to you until the date on which it receives your response. ("Tolled"
means the "clock or time is stopped or suspended". In other words, the deadline for the Administrator to make its decision is "put on hold" until it receives the requested information). The tolling
period ends when the Administrator receives your response, regardless of the adequacy of your response. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the Administrator has determined to that its final decision is to deny your Claim, the written notification of the decision will state the reason(s) for the denial and refer to the
pertinent Plan provision(s). </FONT></P>
