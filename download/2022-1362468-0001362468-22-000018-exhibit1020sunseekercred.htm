<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  44    (b) On each of April 13, 2022  and October 13, 2022; provided that, in each case, no  Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and Borrower has satisfied the conditions to an  Advance set forth in Section 4.03 hereof, an amount equal to [&#8230;***&#8230;] shall be deposited into  the Disbursement Account.  On the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the &#8220;Mandatory  Funding Date&#8221;), to the extent that Advances have not been made into the Disbursement Account  in accordance with this Section 2.01(b) and provided no Event of Default has occurred and is  continuing, the Lenders shall fund any portion of the Commitment which has not been subject to  a Borrowing as the Initial Loan or an additional Advance (the &#8220;Unfunded Loan Balance&#8221;) into  the Disbursement Account which funds shall be controlled by the Disbursement Agent and  funded to Borrower in accordance with the terms of the Disbursement Agreement. Lenders shall  have no obligation to fund additional Advances after the first anniversary of the Closing Date.  All amounts deposited by Lenders into the Disbursement Account shall accrue interest at the  Interest Rate commencing on the date each Advance is deposited into the Disbursement  Account; provided that no Lender shall deposit any additional Advance or the Unfunded Loan  Balance into the Disbursement Account prior to the Mandatory Funding Date except upon one or  more earlier Loan Requests of the Borrower and satisfaction of the conditions precedent to  Advance in Section 4.03. Any Advance made by Lenders shall constitute a &#8220;Loan&#8221; for all  purposes hereunder. Any amount borrowed under this Section 2.01 and subsequently repaid or  prepaid may not be reborrowed.    Section 2.02. Requests for Loans.  Unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative  Agent, to request an Advance (including the Initial Loan), the Borrower shall notify the  Administrative Agent of such request by e-mail not later than 2:00p.m., New York City time,  twelve (12) Business Days prior to the relevant Borrowing date pursuant to a Loan Request. The  Administrative Agent shall promptly provide a copy of such notice to the Lenders. Each such  Loan request shall be irrevocable and shall  include a written Loan Request signed by the  Borrower.  Each such written Loan Request shall specify the aggregate amount of the requested  Loan and the date of such Loan, which shall be a Business Day. Promptly following receipt of a  Loan Request in accordance with this Section 2.02, the Administrative Agent shall advise each  Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender&#8217;s Loan to be made as part of the  requested Loan.  Section 2.03. Funding of Loans.  (a) Each Lender shall make its portion of the Initial Loan or the Advance to be made  by it hereunder on the Initial Funding Date or the applicable date of the Borrowing by wire  transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 p.m., New York City time, or such earlier time  as may be reasonably practicable, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently  designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to  the proposed date of any Loan that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative  Agent such Lender&#8217;s share of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender  has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) and/or (b) of this  Section 2.03 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a  corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable  Loan available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower (but in    45    the case of the Borrower, only to the extent such amounts have been actually funded to the  Borrower) severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith upon written demand  such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such  amount is funded to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative  Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate  determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank  compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate otherwise applicable to such  Loan.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then (x) such amount shall  constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Loan and the Borrower shall not be obligated to  repay such amount pursuant to the preceding sentence if not previously repaid and (y) if such  amount was previously repaid by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly make a  corresponding amount available to the Borrower. For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender&#8217;s  payment to the Administrative Agent or to the Borrower (in the case of the Initial Advance) or  into the Disbursement Account (in the case of any other Advance) shall constitute making such  funds available.   Section 2.04. [Reserved].  Section 2.05. [Reserved].    Section 2.06. Interest on Loans.  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.07, each Loan and the Unfunded Loan  Balance shall bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a  year of  360 days), from the earlier of (x) the date of funding to Borrower and (y) the date of  funding into the Disbursement Account, at a rate per annum applicable thereto equal to  [&#8230;***&#8230;] (the &#8220;Interest Rate&#8221;).  (b) Accrued interest on all Loans and the Unfunded Loan Balance (from and after  funding into the Disbursement Account) shall be payable in arrears on (i) each Payment Date  commencing with the Payment Date on April 30, 2022, (ii) on the Termination Date with respect  to each of the Loans and thereafter on written demand, and (iii) upon any repayment or  prepayment thereof (with respect to the amount repaid or prepaid).  Section 2.07. Default Interest.  If the Borrower and the Guarantor shall default in the  payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or in the payment of any other amount  becoming due hereunder, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, the Borrower  and the Guarantor shall on written demand of the Administrative Agent from time to time pay  interest, to the extent permitted by law, on all overdue amounts up to (but not including) the date  of actual payment (after as well as before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis  of the actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days) equal to the Interest Rate plus  [&#8230;***&#8230;]  Section 2.08. [Reserved].    Section 2.09. Amortization of Loans; Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.    46    (a) The principal amount of the Loans shall be repaid in installments (each, an  &#8220;Installment&#8221;) as set forth on Exhibit A on the Payment Dates set forth on Exhibit A,  commencing on the Payment Date on April 7, 2025.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) such  Installments shall be reduced in connection with any voluntary or mandatory prepayments of the  Loans in accordance with Sections 2.10 and 2.11, as applicable, and (2) the Loans, together with  all other amounts owed hereunder with respect thereto, shall, in any event, be paid in full no later  than the Termination Date.  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or  accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan  made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such  Lender from time to time hereunder.  (c) In addition to the records provided for in the preceding clause (b), the  Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each  Loan made hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become  due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum  received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each  Lender&#8217;s share thereof.  The Borrower shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to request  information regarding the accounts referred to in the preceding sentence.  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (c) of this  Section 2.09 shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations  recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain  such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower  to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  In the event of any conflict  between the records maintained by any Lender and the Register, the Register shall control in the  absence of manifest error.  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory  note.  In such event, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to such Lender a  promissory note payable to such Lender and its registered assigns in a form furnished by the  Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower and which shall provide that  the exercise of a remedy thereunder shall be vested solely in the Administrative Agent as  provided in Section 8.12 hereof.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and  interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.02) be  represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to such payee and its  registered assigns.  Section 2.10. Mandatory Prepayment of Loans; Commitment Termination.  (a) From and after the Final Completion Date, within ninety (90) days of the  Borrower or any of its Affiliates receiving any Net Proceeds as a result of a Recovery Event or,  if later, the next following Payment Date, the Borrower shall apply an amount equal to 100% of  the Net Proceeds received by the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect thereto, to prepay  outstanding Loans in accordance with Section 2.10(b); provided, however, that if (A) prior to the  date any such prepayment is required to be made, the Borrower notifies the Administrative    47    Agent of its intent to repair the subject property or reinvest such Net Proceeds in assets of a kind  then used or usable in the business of the Borrower and (B) no Event of Default under clause (b),  (f) or (g) of Section 7.01 (each, a &#8220;Specified Default&#8221;) shall have occurred and shall be  continuing at the time of proposed repair or reinvestment (unless, in the case of such Specified  Default, such repair or reinvestment is made pursuant to a binding commitment entered into at a  time when no Specified Default was continuing), then the Borrower shall not be required to  prepay Loans hereunder in respect of such Net Proceeds to the extent that such Net Proceeds are  (x) (unless such Net Proceeds constitute collateral for any Permitted Debt) deposited into an  account subject to an Account Control Agreement until applied as set forth in clause (y) or (z)  below; (y) used to prepay Permitted Debt that is secured by a first priority lien over property  from which such Net Proceeds are derived; or (z) used to fund such repairs or reinvested within  365 days after the date of receipt of such Net Proceeds (or, if within such 365 day period, the  Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries enters into a binding commitment to so reinvest in  such Net Proceeds, and such Net Proceeds are so reinvested within 180 days after such binding  commitment is so entered into).    (b) Amounts required to be applied to the prepayment of Loans pursuant to this  Section 2.10 shall be applied in inverse order of maturity to the remaining scheduled Installments  of the Loans being prepaid.  Loans prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.10 may not be reborrowed.  (c) All prepayments under this Section 2.10 shall be accompanied by accrued but  unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of such prepayment plus any  losses or reasonable costs and expenses that are reasonably incurred by a Lender or the  Administrative Agent in connection with the prepayment or the Recovery Event to which the Net  Proceeds relate.  (d) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, with respect to any  Recovery Event occurring prior to the Final Completion Date, Section 6.8 of the Disbursement  Agreement shall govern.  Section 2.11. Optional Prepayment of Loans.  (a) The Borrower may not prepay the Loans from the Initial Funding Date until the  date falling thirty-six (36) months thereafter. Beginning on the date falling thirty-six (36) months  after the Initial Funding Date until the Maturity Date, the Borrower shall have the right, at any  time and from time to time, to prepay any Loans, in whole only, (i)  upon written or facsimile  notice (or notice by electronic mail) to the Administrative Agent received by 1:00 p.m., New  York City time, thirty (30) days prior to the proposed date of prepayment. As of the date of such  prepayment, the Borrower shall pay the principal amount of the Loan in full, all accrued interest  thereon, the Applicable Premium, if any, and all other amounts then due and payable to the  Administrative Agent, the Facility Manager and the Lenders under the Loan Documents.   (b) All prepayments under Section 2.11(a) shall be accompanied by accrued but  unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid to the date of the prepayment, plus the  Applicable Premium, if any, and any losses, costs and expenses that are reasonably incurred by a  Lender or the Administrative Agent in connection with the prepayment. Loans prepaid pursuant  to Section 2.11(a) may not be reborrowed.  </FONT></DIV>

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  48    (c) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the principal  amount of the Loans to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrower to prepay  such Loan by the amount and on the date stated therein; provided that the Borrower may revoke  any notice of prepayment under this Section 2.11 if such prepayment would have resulted from a  refinancing of any or all of the Obligations hereunder, which refinancing shall not be  consummated or shall otherwise be delayed.  The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after  receiving notice from the Borrower hereunder, notify each Lender of the principal amount of the  Loans held by such Lender which are to be prepaid, the prepayment date and the manner of  application of the prepayment.  (d) Any Applicable Premium payable in accordance with this Section 2.11, Section  2.10 or Section 7.01 shall be presumed to be equal to the liquidated damages sustained by the  Lenders as the result of the occurrence of the prepayment (to the extent requiring any such  Applicable Premium), and the Borrower agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances  currently existing.  The Borrower and the Guarantor expressly agree that (i) if the Loans are  accelerated or otherwise become due prior to the Maturity Date (and within the time periods set  forth in the definition of Applicable Premium), in each case, in respect of any Event of Default  (including upon the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency event), the Applicable Premium (if  any) will be due and payable on the date of such acceleration or such other date to the extent  provided in Section 7.01 and, for the avoidance of doubt, subject to clause (3) of the remedies  paragraph in Section 7.01, (ii) the Applicable Premium is reasonable and is the product of an  arm&#8217;s length transaction between sophisticated business people, ably represented by counsel, (iii)  the Applicable Premium shall be payable notwithstanding the then prevailing market rates at the  time payment is made, (iv) there has been a course of conduct between the Lenders and the  Borrower giving specific consideration in the transaction for such agreement to pay the  Applicable Premium, (v) the Borrower and the Guarantor shall be estopped hereafter from  claiming differently than as agreed to in this Section 2.11, Section 2.10 and Section 7.01, (vi) the  agreement to pay the Applicable Premium is a material inducement to the Lenders to make the  Loans, and (vii) the Applicable Premium represents a good faith, reasonable estimate and  calculation of the lost profits or damages of the Lenders and that it would be impractical and  extremely difficult to ascertain the actual amount of damages to the Lenders or profits lost by the  Lenders as a result of such prepayment.   ANY APPLICABLE PREMIUM IS DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES,  AND THE PARTIES HERETO (OTHER THAN THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT) EACH  ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR  IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AND THAT THE AMOUNT THEREOF IS INTENDED TO  BE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES AND  NOT A PENALTY. EACH OF THE OBLIGORS EXPRESSLY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT IT MAY LAWFULLY DO SO) THE PROVISIONS OF ANY PRESENT OR FUTURE  STATUTE OR LAW THAT PROHIBITS OR MAY PROHIBIT THE COLLECTION OF THE  APPLICABLE PREMIUM IN CONNECTION WITH AN ACCELERATION OF THE LOANS  UNDER SECTION 7.01.   Section 2.12. [Reserved].  Section 2.13. [Reserved].      49    Section 2.14. Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation of the Borrower or the  Guarantor hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free and clear of and  without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if any Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes are required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable to the  Administrative Agent, the Facility Manager or any Lender, as determined in good faith by the  Withholding Agent, then (i) the sum payable by the Borrower or the Guarantor shall be increased  as necessary so that after making all required deductions or withholdings for any Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes (including deductions or withholdings for any Indemnified Taxes or Other  Taxes applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14), the Administrative Agent  and each Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have  received had no such deductions or withholdings been made, (ii) the Withholding Agent shall  make such deductions or withholdings and (iii) the Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full  amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with  applicable law.  (b) In addition, the Borrower or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall pay any Other  Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Facility Manager  and each Lender, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any  Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by or on behalf of or withheld or deducted from  payments owing to the Administrative Agent or such Lender on or with respect to any payment  by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower or the Guarantor hereunder or under any  other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or  attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.14) and any penalties, interest and  reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified  Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant  Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to  the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a  Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by  the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative  Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority  evidencing such payment and, to the extent available, a copy of the return reporting such  payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.  (e) Each Lender shall, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, indemnify  the Administrative Agent (to the extent the Administrative Agent has not been reimbursed by the  Borrower) for the full amount of any Taxes imposed by any Governmental Authority that are  attributable to such Lender and that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, together  with all interest, penalties, reasonable costs and expenses arising therefrom or with respect  thereto, as determined by the Administrative Agent in good faith.  A certificate as to the amount  of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be  conclusive absent manifest error.    50    (f) Any Lender that is not a &#8220;United States person&#8221; (as such term is defined in  Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of  withholding tax under the law of the United States, or any treaty to which the United States is a  party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy  to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, including as  reasonably requested by the Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation  prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at  a reduced rate; provided that such Lender shall not be required to deliver any documentation  pursuant to this Section 2.14(f) that such Lender is not legally able to deliver.  (g) (1) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.14(f), each Lender that is not a  &#8220;United States person&#8221; (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)  shall deliver  to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender  becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when the previously  delivered certificates and/or forms expire, or upon request of the Borrower or the Administrative  Agent) whichever of the following is applicable:  (i) two (2) copies of duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form  W- 8BEN-E, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United  States of America is a party,  (ii) two (2) copies of duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,  (iii) two (2) copies of duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY,  together with applicable attachments,  (iv) in the case of such Lender claiming the benefits of exemption for portfolio  interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign  Lender is not (A) a &#8220;bank&#8221; within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a  &#8220;10 percent shareholder&#8221; of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of  the Code, (C) a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the  Code or (D) conducting a trade or business in the United States with which the relevant  interest payments are effectively connected and (y) two (2) copies of duly executed  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, or  (v)  any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming  exemption from or a reduction in United States federal withholding tax, including as  reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to permit the  Borrower to determine the withholding or required deduction to be made.  No Lender shall be required to deliver any form or statement pursuant to this Section 2.14(g) that  such Lender is not legally able to deliver.  (2) Any Lender that is a &#8220;United States Person&#8221; (as such term is defined in  Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, on  or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to  time thereafter when the previously delivered certificates and/or forms expire, or upon request of  the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), two (2) copies of duly executed Internal Revenue    51    Service Form W-9 (or any successor form), properly completed and duly executed by such  Lender, certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from United States backup  withholding tax.  (3) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Loan  Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender  were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those  contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to  the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such  time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such  documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i)  of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the  Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to  comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not  complied with such Lender&#8217;s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct  and withhold from such payment.  (h) If the Administrative Agent  or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion,  reasonably exercised, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes from the  Governmental Authority to which such Taxes or Other Taxes were paid and as to which it has  been indemnified by the Borrower or the Guarantor or with respect to which the Borrower or the  Guarantor has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly pay over  such refund to the Borrower or the Guarantor (but only to the extent of indemnity payments  made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or the Guarantor under this Section 2.14 with  respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses  of the Administrative Agent or such Lender incurred in obtaining such refund (including Taxes  imposed with respect to such refund) and without interest (other than any interest paid to the  relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower or the  Guarantor, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to promptly  repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or the Guarantor (plus any penalties, interest or other  additions to Tax imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent  or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such  refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  paragraph (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any  amount to the Borrower or the Guarantor pursuant to this paragraph (h) if, and then only to the  extent, the payment of such amount would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender in a  less favorable net after-Tax position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender would have  been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had  never been paid.  This Section 2.14(h) shall not be construed to require the Administrative  Agent, the Facility Manager or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other  information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other  Person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative Agent shall have no  duty to prepare or file any federal or state report or return with respect to any funds held pursuant  to this Agreement or any income earned thereon, except for the delivery and filing of tax  information reporting forms required to be delivered and filed with the Internal Revenue Service.

<DIV><FONT size="1" style="font-size:1pt;color:white">  52    (a) The Borrower shall make each payment or prepayment required to be made by it  hereunder (whether of principal, interest, the Applicable Premium, if any, the reimbursement of  amounts payable hereunder) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in  immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such  time on any date may, but shall not be obligated to, in the reasonable discretion of the  Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for  purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative  Agent at its offices at 50 South Sixth Street, Suite 1290, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402,  pursuant to wire instructions to be provided by the Administrative Agent, except that payments  pursuant to Section 10.04 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The  Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any  other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment  hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be  extended to the next succeeding Business Day (and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,  interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension), unless, in the case of  scheduled payments of interest and principal, such next succeeding Business Day would fall in  the next calendar month, in which case the date for payment shall be the next preceding Business  Day.  All payments hereunder shall be made in U.S. Dollars.  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the  Administrative Agent to pay fully all Obligations then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied  (i) first, towards payment of expenses then due under Sections 2.17 and 10.04 payable to the  Administrative Agent, (ii) second, towards payment of expenses then due under Section 2.17,  and 10.04 payable to the Lenders and towards payment of interest then due on account of the  Loans, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of such  expenses and interest then due to such parties and (iii) third, towards payment of principal of the  Loans ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then  due to such parties.    (c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower  prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the  Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may  assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,  in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the  Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay  to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with  interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but  excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds  Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking  industry rules on interbank compensation.  (d) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to  Section 2.03(a), 2.03(b), 8.04 or 10.04(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion  (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the  Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender&#8217;s obligations under  such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.    53    (e) Pro Rata Treatment.  (i)  Each payment by the Borrower in respect of the Loans  shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to the Lenders pro rata according to  the respective amounts then due and owing to the Lenders.  (i) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of  principal of and interest on any Loans shall be made pro rata according to the respective  outstanding principal amounts of such Loans then held by the applicable Lenders (except  that assignments to the Borrower pursuant to Error! Reference source not found. shall  not be subject to this Section 2.15(e)(i)).  Section 2.16. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a) If the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any  Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14, then such  Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking  its Loans hereunder, to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,  branches or affiliates, to file any certificate or document reasonably requested by the Borrower  or to take other reasonable measures, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation,  assignment, filing or other measures (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to  Section 2.14, as the case may be, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed  cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower  hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection  with any such designation or assignment.  Nothing in this Section 2.16 shall affect or postpone  any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.14.  (b) If, after the date hereof, the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to  any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section  2.14, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the  Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign, without recourse (in accordance with and  subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.02), all its interests, rights and obligations  under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be  another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), in any case as of a Business Day specified  in such notice from the Borrower; provided that (i) such terminated or assigning Lender shall  have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued  interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts due, owing and payable to it hereunder at the  time of such termination or assignment, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding  principal and accrued interest and fees in the case of an assignment) or the Borrower (in the case  of all other amounts) and (ii) in the case of an assignment due to payments required to be made  pursuant to Section 2.14, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or  payments.  Section 2.17. The Fee.  The Borrower shall pay to the Facility Manager an upfront loan  fee in accordance with a fee letter between the Borrower and the Facility Manager on the Initial  Funding Date (the &#8220;Fee&#8221;).   Section 2.18. [Intentionally Omitted].      54    Section 2.19. Nature of The Fee.  The Fee shall be paid on the Initial Funding Date, in  immediately available funds, to the Facility Manager, as provided herein.  Once paid, the Fee is  not refundable under any circumstances.  Section 2.20. Right of Set-Off.  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any  Event of Default, the Administrative Agent and each Lender (and their respective banking  Affiliates) are hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted  by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional  or final accounts, in each case, held in trust for an identified beneficiary) at any time held and  other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent and each such Lender (or any  of such banking Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or the Guarantor  against any and all of any such overdue amounts owing under the Loan Documents, irrespective  of whether or not the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under  any Loan Document; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender exercises any such  right of setoff, the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a  statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to  which it exercised such right of setoff.  Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agree  promptly to notify the Borrower and the Guarantor after any such set-off and application made  by such Lender or the Administrative Agent (or any of such banking Affiliates), as the case may  be, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and  application.  The rights of each Lender and the Administrative Agent under this Section 2.20 are  in addition to other rights and remedies which such Lender and the Administrative Agent may  have upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default.  Section 2.21. Payment of Obligations.  Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, upon  the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of any of the Obligations under this  Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents of the Borrower and the Guarantor, the Lenders  shall be entitled to immediate payment of such Obligations.  SECTION 3.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  In order to induce the Lenders to make Loans hereunder, the Borrower, the  Guarantor and each Subsidiary Guarantor, as and to the extent applicable to each Subsidiary  Guarantor only, jointly and severally represent and warrant as follows:  Section 3.01. Organization and Authority.

Section 8.05. Successor Agents.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a  successor agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time  by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation by the Administrative  Agent, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent (provided no Event of Default  or Default has occurred and is continuing) of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the  Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the  retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative  Agent may, with the consent (provided no Event of Default or Default has occurred or is  continuing) of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), appoint  a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank institution with an office in New York,  New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.

The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those  payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.   After the retiring Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article  and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent,  its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be  taken by any of them while it was acting as an Administrative Agent.  Section 8.06. Independent Lenders.  Each Lender acknowledges that it has,  independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and  based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit  analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and  based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,  continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this  Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. Any  corporation or association resulting from any such conversion, sale, merger, consolidation or  transfer to which the Administrative Agent is a party, will be and become the successor  Administrative Agent under this Agreement and will have and succeed to the rights, powers,  duties, immunities and privileges as its predecessor, without the execution or filing of any  instrument or paper or the performance of any further act.  Section 8.07. Advances and Payments.  (a) On the date of each Loan, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized (but not  obligated) to advance, for the account of each of the Lenders, the amount of the Loan to be made  by it in accordance with its Commitment hereunder.  Should the Administrative Agent do so,  each of the Lenders agrees forthwith to reimburse the Administrative Agent in immediately    99    available funds for the amount so advanced on its behalf by the Administrative Agent, together  with interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate if not so reimbursed on the date due from and  including such date but not including the date of reimbursement.  (b) Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent in connection with this  Agreement (other than amounts to which the Administrative Agent is entitled pursuant to  Sections 2.17, 8.04 and 10.04), the application of which is not otherwise provided for in this  Agreement, shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.15(b).  All amounts to be paid to a  Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be credited to that Lender, after collection by the  Administrative Agent, in immediately available funds either by wire transfer or deposit in that  Lender&#8217;s correspondent account with the Administrative Agent, as such Lender and the  Administrative Agent shall from time to time agree.  Section 8.08. Sharing of Setoffs.  Each Lender agrees that, except to the extent this  Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender, if it shall,  through the exercise either by it or any of its banking Affiliates of a right of banker&#8217;s lien, setoff  or counterclaim against the Borrower or the Guarantor, including, but not limited to, a secured  claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from, or in  lieu of, such secured claim and received by such Lender (or any of its banking Affiliates) under  any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or otherwise, obtain payment in  respect of its Loans as a result of which the unpaid portion of its Loans is proportionately less  than the unpaid portion of the Loans of any other Lender (a) it shall promptly purchase at par  (and shall be deemed to have thereupon purchased) from such other Lender a participation in the  Loans of such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of each Lender&#8217;s  Loans and its participation in Loans of the other Lenders shall be in the same proportion to the  aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Loans then outstanding as the principal amount of its  Loans prior to the obtaining of such payment was to the principal amount of all Loans  outstanding prior to the obtaining of such payment and (b) such other adjustments shall be made  from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure that the Lenders share such payment pro-rata,  provided that if any such non-pro-rata payment is thereafter recovered or otherwise set aside,  such purchase of participations shall be rescinded (without interest).  The Borrower expressly  consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that  any Lender holding (or deemed to be holding) a participation in a Loan acquired pursuant to this  Section or any of its banking Affiliates may exercise any and all rights of banker&#8217;s lien, setoff or  counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower to such Lender as fully  as if such Lender was the original obligee thereon, in the amount of such participation.  The  provisions of this Section 8.08 shall not be construed to apply to (a) any payment made by the  Borrower or the Guarantor pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this  Agreement or (b) any payment obtained by any Lender as consideration for the assignment or  sale of a participation in any of its Loans or other Obligations owed to it.  Section 8.09. Withholding Taxes.  To the extent required by any applicable law, the  Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to  any withholding tax applicable to such payment.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other  Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold  tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason, or the Administrative  Agent has paid over to the Internal Revenue Service applicable withholding tax relating to a  </FONT></DIV>

The Lender of the Initial Loan hereby appoints the Facility Manager  to receive on its behalf all notices, communications, information and documents to be made or  despatched to such Lender under the Loan Documents and the Parties agree that the Facility  Manager shall generally act as a point of contact and liaison for and on behalf of such Lender in  respect of all matters connected with the Loan Documents. Such appointment shall remain in full  force and effect for so long as any amount is outstanding under the Loan Documents or any  Commitment of such Lender is in force, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Borrower and  the Facility Manager.

The entries in the  Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Guarantor, the  Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in  the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this  Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for  inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time  upon reasonable prior notice.  (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no assignment  may be made hereunder to any Defaulting Lender or any of its subsidiaries, or any Person  who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons  described in this clause (v).

The Lender selling the participation to such Participant shall be subject to the  terms of Section 2.16(b) if such Participant requests compensation or additional amounts  pursuant to Section 2.14.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a  Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14 unless such Participant agrees,  for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Sections 2.14(f), 2.14(g) and 2.14(h) as  though it were a Lender.  (e) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any  portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without  limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any  central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender, and this Section 10.02 shall not apply to any  such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a  security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any  such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.  (f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or proposed  assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 10.02, disclose to the assignee or participant  or proposed assignee or participant, any information relating to the Borrower or the Guarantor  furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the Borrower or the Guarantor; provided that prior to  any such disclosure, each such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant  provides to the Administrative Agent its agreement in writing to be bound for the benefit of the  Borrower by either the provisions of Section 10.03 or other provisions at least as restrictive as  Section 10.03.    106    Section 10.03. Confidentiality.  Each Lender agrees to keep any information delivered or  made available by the Borrower or the Guarantor to it confidential, in accordance with its  customary procedures, from anyone other than persons employed or retained by such Lender or  its Affiliates who are or are expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring,  insuring or administering the Loans, and who are advised by such Lender of the confidential  nature of such information; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Lender from  disclosing such information (a) to any of its Affiliates and their respective agents and advisors (it  being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the  confidential nature of such information and instructed to keep such information confidential) or  to any other Lender, (b) to the extent required by Law or regulations or upon the order of any  court or administrative agency, (c) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or  authority (including any self-regulatory authority), (d) which has been publicly disclosed other  than as a result of a disclosure by the Administrative Agent or any Lender which is not permitted  by this Agreement, (e) in connection with any litigation to which the Administrative Agent, any  Lender, or their respective Affiliates may be a party to the extent reasonably required under  applicable rules of discovery, (f) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the  exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document, (g) to such Lender&#8217;s legal  counsel and independent auditors, (h) on a confidential basis to (I) any rating agency in  connection with rating the Guarantor and its Subsidiaries or any Facility, (II) the CUSIP Service  Bureau or any similar agency in connection with the issuance and monitoring of CUSIP numbers  with respect to the Facility or (III) any direct or indirect provider of credit protection to such  Lender or its Affiliates (or its brokers), (i) with the consent of the Borrower, (j) to any actual or  proposed participant or assignee of all or part of its rights hereunder or to any direct or indirect  contractual counterparty (or the professional advisors thereto) to any swap or derivative  transaction relating to the Guarantor and its obligations, in each case, subject to the proviso in  Section 10.02(f) (with any reference to any assignee or participant set forth in such proviso being  deemed to include a reference to such contractual counterparty for purposes of this  Section 10.03(j)), (k) to the extent that such information is received by such Lender from a third  party that is not, to such Lender&#8217;s knowledge, subject to confidentiality obligations to the  Borrower, (l) to the extent that such information is independently developed by such Lender, (m)  any prospective or actual funding sources and (n)to any other party hereto.

Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal  or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of  such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and  enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a  particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.    111    Section 10.10.
