                  SECTION 2.1 Amendment, Modification and Restatement. On and as
of the Effective Date, upon satisfaction of the conditions specified in Article
VI hereof, each of the Existing Facilities is hereby amended and modified as
provided in this Agreement, with the affirmative, negative and financial
covenants and undertakings corresponding to affirmative, negative and financial
covenants (including those covenants and undertakings in respect of the
providing of guarantees or the pledge of collateral), reporting requirements,
mandatory prepayment requirements, collateral release provisions, increased cost
provisions, tax gross-up provisions, allocation of prepayment provisions,
provisions related to market disruption and illegality events, representations
and warranties, and event of default provisions (other than those relating to

be created or incurred in applicable circumstances shall continue in full force
and effect and provided, further, that the terms of the Equity Derivatives shall

thereupon be deemed to be restated in its entirety as in effect immediately

All existing guarantees by any Warnaco Entity under any Covered Facility are

applicable, maturity date for each loan and other credit extension under each of
the other Existing Facilities shall remain unchanged.

Existing Facility shall be used solely as specified in such Existing Facility.

                  (a) Compliance with Laws, Etc. It will comply, and cause each
         of its Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all
         applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders, such compliance to
         include, without limitation, compliance with ERISA and Environmental
         Laws, except where the failure to so comply would not reasonably be

                  (b) Payment of Taxes, Etc. It will pay and discharge, and
         cause each of its Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, before the same

         imposed upon it or upon its property and (ii) all taxes and other
         lawful claims that, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien upon its
         property; provided, however, that neither Group nor any of its
         Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax,
         assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in good faith and
         by proper proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves are being
         maintained in accordance with GAAP, unless and until any Liens
         resulting therefrom attach to its property and become

         enforceable against its other creditors so long as any such amount

         Permits; obtain and renew and cause each of its Subsidiaries to obtain
         and renew all material Environmental Permits necessary for its

         its properties, in accordance with and to the extent required by all
         applicable Environmental Laws; provided, however, that neither Group
         nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to undertake any such
         cleanup, removal, remedial or other action to the extent that its
         obligation to do so is being contested in good faith and by proper
         proceedings and appropriate reserves are being maintained with respect
         to such circumstances.

                  (d) Maintenance of Insurance. It will maintain, and cause each
         of its Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance with responsible and

         maintain, its existence, legal structure, legal name, rights (charter
         and statutory), permits, licenses, approvals, privileges and franchises
         (except for the failure to pay any franchise tax, which failure is
         promptly cured); provided, however, that Group and its Subsidiaries may
         consummate any merger or consolidation permitted under Section 2.6(c);
         and provided further that neither Group nor any of its Subsidiaries
         shall be required to preserve any right, permit, license, approval,
         privilege or franchise if the Board of Directors of Group or such
         Subsidiary shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
         desirable in the conduct of the business of Group or such Subsidiary,
         as the case may be, and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in
         any material respect to Group, such Subsidiary or the Lender Parties.

                  (f) Visitation Rights. It will at any reasonable time and from
         time to time, permit any of the Agents or any of the Lender Parties, or

         Subsidiaries to keep, proper books of record and account, in which full
         and correct entries shall be made of all financial transactions and the
         assets and business of Group and each such Subsidiary in accordance
         with GAAP.

                  (h) Maintenance of Properties, Etc. It will maintain and

         Debt Coordinators in all respects to cure any such default, and (iv)
         cause each of its Subsidiaries to do so, except, in any of the
         foregoing clauses (i) through (iv), where the failure to do so, either
         individually or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to
         have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) Transactions with Affiliates. It will conduct, and cause
         each of its Subsidiaries to conduct, other than with respect to
         transactions among Group and/or any Subsidiaries, all transactions
         otherwise permitted under the Loan Documents with any of their
         Affiliates on terms that are no less favorable to it or such Subsidiary
         than it would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a
         Person not an Affiliate, provided, however, that the foregoing
         restriction shall not apply to transactions pursuant to any agreement
         referred to in Section 2.6(a)(iv), and provided further that no Loan
         Party shall engage in any transaction with any other Loan Party or any
         Subsidiary of a Loan Party that would render such Loan Party or

         Party to do so.

                  (m) Preparation of Environmental Reports. At the request of
         the Debt Coordinators from time to time after receipt of a notice of
         the type specified in Section 2.8(j), Group will provide to the Lender
         Parties within 60 days after such request, at its own expense, an
         environmental assessment report for the applicable property described
         in such notice, prepared by an environmental consulting firm reasonably
         acceptable to the Debt Coordinators, indicating the presence of
         Hazardous Materials that could reasonably be expected to give rise to a
         material liability and the estimated cost of any compliance, removal or
         remedial action in connection with any Hazardous Materials that could
         reasonably be expected to give rise to a material liability on such
         properties; without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the
         Debt Coordinators determine at any time that a material risk exists
         that any such report will not be provided within the time referred to
         above, the Debt Coordinators may retain an environmental consulting
         firm to prepare such report at the expense of Group, and Group hereby
         grants and agrees to cause any Subsidiary that owns any property
         described in such request to grant at the time of such request to the
         Debt Coordinators, such firm and any agents or representatives thereof
         an irrevocable non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of tenants,
         to enter onto their respective properties to undertake such an
         assessment, and to, or to cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate in all
         reasonable respects with the preparation of such assessment.

         statement that names any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries as
         debtor, or sign or suffer to exist, or permit any of its Subsidiaries
         to sign or suffer to exist, any security agreement authorizing any
         secured party thereunder to file such financing statement, or assign,
         or permit any of its Subsidiaries to assign, any accounts or other

         (ii) made together with accrued interest to the date of such payment on
         the principal amount prepaid.

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         paragraph (a) of this Section 2.9 or in Section 2.6(d), so long as no
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing, if, on any date on which
         a payment to the Administrative Agent would otherwise be required
         pursuant to this Section 2.9 or Section 2.6(d), the aggregate amount of
         Net Cash Proceeds or other amounts otherwise required by such Sections
         to be paid to the Administrative Agent on such date are less than or
         equal to $5,000,000, Group may defer such prepayment until the date on
         which the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds or other amounts
         otherwise required by such Sections to be paid to the Administrative
         Agent exceeds $5,000,000, provided that during such deferral period
         such amounts, to the extent originally constituting Net Cash Proceeds,
         shall otherwise be deemed to retain their original character as Net
         Cash Proceeds for application as required by this Section 2.9. Upon the
         occurrence of a Default, Group shall immediately pay to the
         Administrative

                                       25

         Agent the amount of all Net Cash Proceeds received by any Loan Party or
         any of its Subsidiaries and other amounts, as applicable, that are
         required to be paid to the Administrative Agent by this Section 2.9
         (without giving effect to the first and second sentences of this
         paragraph (c)) but which have not previously been so paid.

                  SECTION 2.10 Release of Collateral. Upon the sale, transfer or
other disposition of any item of Collateral (including 100% of the capital stock
of a Subsidiary) of any Loan Party to any third party which is not an Affiliate
in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, and the payment by Group of
the Net Cash Proceeds thereof to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the
provisions of Section 2.9 hereof (if applicable), the Collateral Trustee will,
at Group's expense, execute and deliver to such Loan Party such documents as
such Loan Party may reasonably request (without representation or warranty) to
evidence the release of such (i) Subsidiary from the Loan Documents to which it
is a party and (ii) item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest
granted under the Collateral Documents in accordance with the terms of the Loan
Documents.

                  SECTION 2.11 Increased Costs, Etc. (a) If, due to either (i)
the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law),
there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make
or of making, funding or maintaining eurodollar rate credit extensions under any
Covered Facility or of agreeing to issue or of issuing or maintaining or
participating in letters of credit or bankers' acceptances or other credit
extensions (excluding, for purposes of this Section 2.11, any such increased
costs resulting from (x) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section 2.12 shall
govern) and (y) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net income or
overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign jurisdiction or
state under the laws of which such Lender Party is organized or has its
applicable lending office or any political subdivision thereof), then Group
shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such
demand to the Debt Coordinators), pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender Party additional amounts sufficient to compensate such
Lender Party for such increased cost; provided, however, that before making any
such demand, a Lender Party claiming additional amounts under this Section
2.11(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy
and legal and regulatory restrictions) to designate a different applicable
lending office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or
reduce the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would
not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise
disadvantageous to such Lender Party. A certificate as to the amount of such
increased cost, submitted to Group by such Lender Party, shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (b) If any Lender Party determines that compliance with any
         law or regulation or any guideline or request from any central bank or
         other governmental authority (whether or not having the force of law)
         affects or would affect the amount of capital required or expected to
         be maintained by such Lender Party or any corporation controlling such
         Lender Party and that the amount of such capital is increased by or
         based upon the

                                       26




<Page>




         existence of such Lender Party's commitment to lend or provide other
         credit extensions under the Covered Facilities (or similar contingent
         obligations), then, upon demand by such Lender Party or such
         corporation (with a copy of such demand to the Debt Coordinators),
         Group shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
         Lender Party, from time to time as specified by such Lender Party,
         additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party in the
         light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender Party
         reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the
         existence of such Lender Party's commitment to provide credit
         extensions under the Covered Facilities. A certificate as to such
         amounts submitted to Group by such Lender Party shall be conclusive and
         binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (c) If, with respect to any eurodollar rate credit extensions
         under the Covered Facilities, the Required Lenders notify the Debt
         Coordinators that the eurodollar rate for any applicable interest
         period for any credit extensions under any Covered Facility will not
         adequately reflect the cost to such Lender Parties of making, funding
         or maintaining their eurodollar rate credit extensions for such
         interest period, the Debt Coordinators shall forthwith so notify Group
         and the Lender Parties, whereupon (i) each such eurodollar rate credit
         extension under the Covered Facilities will automatically, on the last
         day of the then existing interest period therefor, convert into a base
         rate credit extension and (ii) the obligation of the Lender Parties to
         make, or to convert credit extensions under the Covered Facilities
         into, eurodollar rate credits shall be suspended until the Debt
         Coordinators shall notify Group that the Required Lenders have
         determined that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
         exist; provided, that any Covered Facility that does not by its terms
         provided for base rate loans shall be deemed in the circumstances
         described in this clause (c) to provided for interest at the "Base
         Rate" (as defined in the Bridge Facility).

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
         other Loan Document or any Covered Facility, if the introduction of or
         any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation shall
         make it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority
         shall assert that it is unlawful, for any Lender Party or its
         eurodollar rate lending office to perform its obligations under any
         Covered Facility to make eurodollar rate credit extensions or to
         continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate credit extensions under
         the Covered Facilities, then, on notice thereof and demand therefor by
         such Lender Party to Group through the Debt Coordinators, (i) each
         eurodollar rate credit extension, and each commitment by such Lender
         Party to make eurodollar rate credit extensions, under the Covered
         Facilities will automatically, upon such demand, convert into a base
         rate credit extension or commitment and (ii) the obligation of the
         Lender Parties to make, or maintain or to convert credit extensions
         into, eurodollar rate credit extensions under the Covered Facilities
         shall be suspended until the Debt Coordinators shall notify Group that
         such Lender Party has determined that the circumstances causing such
         suspension no longer exist, provided, however, that, before making any
         such demand, such Lender Party agrees to use reasonable efforts
         (consistent with its internal policy and legal and regulatory
         restrictions) to designate a different

                                       27




<Page>




         eurodollar lending office if the making of such a designation would
         allow such Lender Party or its eurodollar lending office to continue to
         perform its obligations to make eurodollar rate credit extensions or to
         continue to fund or maintain eurodollar rate credit extensions and
         would not, in the judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

                  SECTION 2.12 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Loan
Parties under the Loan Documents and under the Covered Facilities, and by any
Lender Party to any other Lender Party under the Loan Documents, shall be made
free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding, in the case of each Lender Party and each Agent,
taxes that are imposed on its overall net income by the United States and taxes
that are imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu
thereof) by the state or foreign jurisdiction under the laws of which such
Lender Party or such Agent, as the case may be, is organized or any political
subdivision thereof and, in the case of each Lender Party, taxes that are
imposed on its overall net income (and franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof)
by the state or foreign jurisdiction of such Lender Party's applicable lending
office or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings and liabilities in respect of
payments under the Loan Documents or under the Covered Facilities being
hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Loan Party or Lender Party shall be
required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable under
any Loan Documents or under any Covered Facility to any Lender Party or any
Agent, (i) the sum payable by such Loan Party or Lender Party shall be increased
as may be necessary so that after the Loan Party or Lender Party, as applicable,
and the Debt Coordinators have made all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.12) such
Lender Party or such Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Loan Party
or Lender Party making such payment shall make all such deductions and (iii)
Group shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or
other authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (b) In addition, the Loan Parties shall pay any present or
         future stamp, documentary, excise, property or similar taxes, charges
         or levies that arise from any payment made by any Loan Party under the
         Loan Documents or under the Covered Facilities, or by any Lender Party
         under the Loan Documents, or from the execution, delivery or
         registration of, performance under, or otherwise with respect to, any
         of the Loan Documents or Covered Facilities (hereinafter referred to as
         "Other Taxes").

                  (c) The Loan Parties shall indemnify each Lender Party and
         each Agent for and hold them harmless against the full amount of Taxes
         and Other Taxes, and for the full amount of taxes of any kind imposed
         by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 2.12, imposed
         on or paid by such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) and
         any liability (including penalties, additions to tax, interest and
         expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto. This
         indemnification shall be made within 30 days from the date such Lender
         Party or such Agent (as the case may be) makes written

                                       28




<Page>




         demand therefor.

                  (d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes,
         Group shall furnish to the Administrative Agent, at its address
         referred to in Section 8.1 of the Intercreditor Agreement, the original
         or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing such payment. In the case
         of any payment made under the Loan Documents or under the Covered
         Facilities by or on behalf of the Loan Parties through an account or
         branch outside the United States or by or on behalf of the Loan Parties
         by a payor that is not a United States person, if Group determines that
         no Taxes are payable in respect thereof, Group shall furnish, or shall
         cause such payor to furnish, to the Administrative Agent, at such
         address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to the Debt Coordinators
         stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For purposes of this
         Section 2.12, the terms "United States" and "United States person"
         shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of the Code.

                  (e) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a
         jurisdiction outside the United States, on or prior to the date that it
         becomes a party to this Agreement or any Covered Facility, and from
         time to time thereafter if requested in writing by Group or the agent
         under the applicable Covered Facility (but only so long as such Lender
         Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide Group and the
         agent under the applicable Covered Facility with two original Internal
         Revenue Service forms W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI, as appropriate, or any
         successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service,
         certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from or entitled to a
         reduced rate of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to
         any Loan Document or Covered Facility. If any Lender Party which is not
         a "United States person" determines that it is unable to submit to
         Group or the agent under the applicable Covered Facility any form or
         certificate that such Lender Party is otherwise required to submit
         pursuant to this Section 2.12, or that is required to withdraw or
         cancel any such form or certificate, or that any such form or
         certificate previously submitted has otherwise become ineffective or
         inaccurate, such Lender Party shall promptly notify Group and the agent
         under the applicable Covered Facility of such fact. In addition, if a
         Lender Party provides a form W-8 (or any successor form) to the agent
         under the applicable Covered Facility and Group pursuant to this
         Section 2.12, such Lender Party shall also provide a certificate
         stating that it is not a "bank" within the meaning of Section
         881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, and shall promptly notify the agent under the
         applicable Covered Facility and Group if such Lender Party determines
         that it is no longer able to provide such certification. If the form
         provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender Party first becomes
         a party to any Loan Document or Covered Facility indicates a United
         States interest withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax
         at such rate shall be considered excluded from Taxes unless and until
         such Lender Party provides the appropriate form certifying that a
         lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding tax at such lesser rate only
         shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods governed by such
         form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Joinder Agreement
         or relevant assignment and acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party
         becomes a party to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Covered Facility,
         as applicable, the Lender Party or Lender Party assignor, as
         applicable, was entitled to

                                       29




<Page>




         payments under subsection (a) in respect of United States withholding
         tax with respect to interest paid at such date, then, to such extent,
         the term Taxes shall include (in addition to withholding taxes that may
         be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise includable in
         Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect
         to the Lender Party or Lender Party assignee, as applicable, on such
         date. Upon the reasonable request of Group or the agent under the
         applicable Covered Facility, each Lender Party that has not provided
         the forms or other documents, as provided above, on the basis of being
         a United States person shall submit to Group and the agent under the
         applicable Covered Facility a certificate to the effect that it is such
         a "United States person" (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
         Internal Revenue Code).

                  (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has
         failed to provide Group with the appropriate form described in Section
         2.12(e) (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring
         subsequent to the date on which such Lender Party became a Lender
         Party, or if such form otherwise is not required under the first
         sentence of subsection (e) above because Group has not requested in
         writing such form subsequent to the date on which such Lender Party
         became a Lender Party), such Lender Party shall not be entitled to
         indemnification under Section 2.12(a) or (c) with respect to Taxes
         imposed by the United States; provided, however, that should a Lender
         Party become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
         required hereunder, Group shall take such steps as the Lender Party or
         Debt Coordinators shall reasonably request to assist the Lender Party
         to recover such Taxes.

                  (g) Any Lender Party claiming any additional amounts payable
         pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall use reasonable efforts (consistent
         with its internal policy and legal and regulatory restrictions) to
         change the jurisdiction of its eurodollar lending office if the making
         of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any
         such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in
         the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise
         disadvantageous to such Lender Party.

                  (h) Within 60 days after the written request of Group or the
         Administrative Agent, each Lender Party shall execute and deliver to
         Group such certificates or forms as are reasonably requested by Group
         in such request, which can be furnished consistent with the facts and
         which are reasonably necessary to assist the Loan Parties in applying
         for refunds of Taxes paid by the Loan Parties hereunder or any Covered
         Facility or making payment of Taxes hereunder or any Covered Facility;
         provided, however, that no Lender Party or Agent shall be required to
         furnish to Group any financial or other information which it considers
         confidential. The cost of preparing any materials referred to in the
         previous sentence shall be borne by Group. If a Lender Party or Agent
         determines in good faith that it has received a refund of any Taxes or
         Other Taxes with respect to which the Loan Parties have made a payment
         of additional amounts, such Lender Party or Agent shall pay to Group an
         amount that such Lender Party or Agent determines in good faith to be
         equal to the net benefit, after tax, that was obtained by such Lender
         Party or Agent (as the case may be) as a consequence of such refund.

                  SECTION 2.13 Payments and Computations. (a) Each Lender Party
and each Loan Party, as applicable, shall make each payment hereunder and under
each other Loan Document, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the
day when due in U.S. dollars to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative
Agent's Account in same day funds, with payments being received by the
Administrative Agent after such time being deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter
cause like funds to be distributed in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement.

                  (b) All computations of amounts due under the Loan Documents
         shall be made by the Debt Coordinators on the basis of a year of 360
         days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first
         day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such
         amounts are payable. Each determination by the Debt Coordinators of an
         amount due under the Loan Documents shall be conclusive and binding for
         all purposes, absent manifest error.

                  (c) Whenever any payment under any of the Loan Documents shall
         be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
         shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension
         of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of
         interest or commitment fee, as the case may be.

                  SECTION 2.14 Certain Post-Closing Matters. (a) With respect to
those Subsidiaries of Group incorporated or organized under the laws of Belgium,
Mexico, Hong Kong and Barbados, Group will cause to be furnished, within 60 days
after the Effective Date, all documents and instruments, and cause to be
performed, by such date, all actions, in each case of the type specified in
Section 6.1(a) with respect to Foreign Credit Parties, including counterparts of
this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Debt
Coordinators and the Subsidiary Guaranty executed and delivered by all
Subsidiaries in such jurisdictions, and such other documents sufficient in the
judgment of the Debt Coordinators to create in favor of the Collateral Trustee
for the benefit of the Secured Parties a perfected first priority security
interest in the property of all such Subsidiaries (other than Excluded
Property), such documents to include evidence of corporate good standing,
corporate authority and legal opinions, and all other related documentation;
provided that the Debt Coordinators may extend the 60 day time period specified
in this subsection (a) by up to an additional 45 days if requested by Group.

                  (b) With respect to all material intellectual property license
         agreements to which Group or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (other
         than any such license agreements which are the subject of actual
         litigation between the licensor and licensee as of the Effective Date),
         Group will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause, within 30
         days after the Effective Date, all licensors party to such license
         agreements to consent to a grant of a security interest in such license
         (but not to the exercise by the Collateral Agent or any Secured Party
         of any remedies with respect thereto) to the Collateral Trustee for the
         benefit of the Secured Parties.

                                       31

                  (c) Group will within 6 months after the Effective Date either
         sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the assets defined on Schedule
         2.6(d)(iii) as the Costa Rica Assets, Paris Apartment, German Real
         Estate and NYC Apartment, with the Net Cash Proceeds therefrom applied
         as specified in Section 2.9, or by such date, (i) Costa Rica will be
         deemed to be an Included Foreign Jurisdiction for all purposes
         hereunder, and Group will, by such date, cause to be furnished all
         documents and instruments, and cause to be performed all actions, in
         each case of the type specified in Section 6.1(a) with respect to
         Foreign Credit Parties, including the execution and delivery of
         counterparts of this Agreement in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to the Debt Coordinators and of the Subsidiary Guaranty by
         all Subsidiaries in such jurisdictions, and such other documents
         sufficient in the judgment of the Debt Coordinators to create in favor
         of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties a
         perfected first priority security interest in the relevant property of
         such jurisdiction and (ii) with respect to all other assets specified
         above, Group will, by such date, cause to be furnished all documents
         and instruments, and cause to be performed all actions, in each case of
         the type specified in Section 6.1(a) with respect to such assets as are
         sufficient in the judgment of the Debt Coordinators to create in favor
         of the Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the Secured Parties a
         perfected first priority security interest in such assets.

                  (d) With respect to all leasehold mortgages to be delivered
         pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(v), Group will use all commercially
         reasonable efforts to cause, within 30 days after the Effective Date,

                           shall apply to any alteration to or extension of the
                           expiration date of any Letter of Credit or any Letter
                           of Credit issued to replace, extend or alter any
                           Letter of Credit during the term of this Agreement.
                           None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or prevent
                           the vesting of any of the rights or powers granted to
                           the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder. In
                           furtherance and extension and not in limitation or
                           derogation of any of the foregoing, any action taken

                  created under the Collateral Documents (including the first
                  priority nature thereof) and the Covered Documents or (iv) the
                  exercise by any Agent or any Lender Party of its rights under

                  This Agreement and each Covered Document is, and each other
                  Loan Document when delivered will be, the legal, valid and
                  binding obligation of each Loan party thereto, enforceable
                  against such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except
                  as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
                  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
                  affecting creditors' rights generally and by general
                  principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
                  sought in equity or at law).

                  litigation or proceeding affecting any Loan Party or any of

                  including any Environmental Action, pending or threatened
                  before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator that (i)
                  would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
                  or (ii) purports to affect the legality, validity or
                  enforceability of any Loan Document or Covered Document or the
                  transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and the
                  Covered Documents.

jurisdiction), and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State court or, to
the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court (or, in such local court, as
aforesaid). Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

                  (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally
         waives, to the

                                       56

         fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
         it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action
         or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
         the other Loan Documents to which it is a party in any New York State
         or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives,
         to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
         forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
         court.

                  (c) Each Loan Party which is a Foreign Subsidiary hereby
         irrevocably and unconditionally appoints Corporation Service Company
         with an office on the date hereof at 2 World Trade Center, New York,
         New York, United States and its successors hereunder (the "Process
         Agent"), as its agent to receive on behalf of such Loan Party and its
         property service of copies of the summons and complaint and any other
         process which may be served in any such suit, action or proceeding
         brought in any New York State court or Federal court of the United
         States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court
         from any thereof. Such service may be made by mailing or delivering a
         copy of such process to Group in care of the Process Agent at the
         address specified above for the Process Agent, and each such Loan Party
         hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the Process Agent to accept
         such service on its behalf. Each such Loan Party further consents to
         service of process which may be served in any action or suit brought in
         any New York State court or Federal court of the United States of
         America sitting in New York City, and any appellate court from any
         thereof, by mailing copies thereof by registered or certified mail,
         postage prepaid, to such Loan Party at its address for notice
         hereunder, such service to become effective 30 days after mailing.
         Failure of the Process Agent to give notice to any such Loan Party or
         failure of any such Loan Party to receive notice of such service of
         process shall not affect in any way the validity of such service on the
         Process Agent or such Loan Parties. Each Loan Party which is a Foreign
         Subsidiary covenants and agrees that it shall take any and all
         reasonable action, including the execution and filing of any and all
         documents, that may be necessary to continue the designation of the
         Process Agent above in full force and effect, and to cause the Process
         Agent to act as such. In the event that at any time such Process Agent
         shall for any reason cease to maintain an office in the Borough of
         Manhattan in New York City, or cease to act as Process Agent, then as
         an alternate method of service, each such Loan Party irrevocably
         consents to the service of any and all process in any such suit, action
         or proceeding in any New York State court or Federal court of the
         United States of America sitting in New York City, and any appellate
         court from any thereof, by mailing of copies of such process to such
         Loan Party at its address specified in Section 8.1 of the Intercreditor
         Agreement. Each such Loan Party acknowledges and agrees that nothing
         herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in any other
         manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other
         jurisdiction.

                  (d) If for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court it
         is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder to any party hereunder in
         one currency into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to the
         fullest extent permitted by law, that the rate of exchange used shall
         be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures such

                                       57




<Page>




         party could purchase the first currency with such other currency in New
         York City on the day which is at least two Business Days prior to the
         day on which final judgment is rendered.

                  (e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligation of
         any party in respect of any sum payable hereunder by it to any other
         party hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the
         "Judgment Currency") other than Dollars (the "Agreement Currency"), be
         discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following
         receipt by such other party of any sum adjudged to be so due in the
         Judgment Currency such other party may in accordance with normal
         banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment
         Currency; if the amount of the Agreement Currency which could have been
         so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such other party in
         the Agreement Currency, such first party agrees, as a separate
         obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such
         other party against such loss, and, if the amount of the Agreement
         Currency which could have been so purchased exceeds the sum originally
         due to such other party, such other party agrees to remit to such first
         party such excess.

                  (f) To the extent that any of the parties hereto has or
         hereafter may acquire any immunity (sovereign or otherwise) from any
         legal action, suit or proceeding, form jurisdiction of any court or
         from set-off or any legal process (whether service or notice,
         attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
         judgment, execution or judgment or otherwise) with respect to itself or
         any of its property each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
         waives and agrees not to plead or claim such immunity in respect of its
         obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of
         the parties hereto agrees that the waivers set forth above shall have
         the fullest extent permitted under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
         of the United States of America and are intended to be irrevocable and
         not subject to withdrawal for purposes of such act.

                  SECTION 9.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

                  SECTION 9.8 Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the actions of the
Debt Coordinators, the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Trustee or any
Lender Party in the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement
hereof or thereof.

                  SECTION 9.9 Appointment and Acknowledgment. Each Subsidiary of
Group which is a party hereto hereby (i) irrevocably appoints Group as its
representative in connection with the entering into of the Intercreditor
Agreement, and agrees to be bound by the terms and provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement as though it had been a signatory thereto and (ii)
acknowledges that Group will, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement,

                                       58

execute and deliver the Intercreditor Agreement in its individual capacity and
as representative of each such Subsidiary.

                  SECTION 9.10 Conflict with Other Agreements. In the event of
any conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and any Collateral
Document now existing or hereafter entered into (excluding the Collateral Trust
Agreement), the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. In the event of any
conflict between this Agreement (or any portion thereof) and the Collateral
Trust Agreement, the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement shall prevail.

                  SECTION 9.11 Foreign Subsidiary Collateral Limitation.
Notwithstanding any provision of any Loan Document to the contrary, (i) no more
than 66% of the Equity Interests in or of any Foreign Subsidiary shall be
pledged or similarly hypothecated to guaranty or support any Obligation of any
U.S. Credit Party, (ii) no Foreign Subsidiary shall guaranty or otherwise
support any Obligation of any U.S. Credit Party and (iii) no security or similar
interest in the assets of any Foreign Subsidiary (other than not more than 66%
of the Equity Interests in or of any Foreign Subsidiary) shall guarantee or
support any Obligation of any U.S. Credit Party. The parties agree that any
pledge, guaranty or security or similar interest made or granted in
contravention of this Section 9.11 shall be void ab initio.
