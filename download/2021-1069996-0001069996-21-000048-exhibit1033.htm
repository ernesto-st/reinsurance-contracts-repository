Any claim or loss payment due the Company hereunder shall be deemed due 10 days  after the proof of loss or demand for payment is transmitted to the Reinsurer.  If such  loss or claim payment is not received within the 10 days, interest will accrue on the  payment or amount overdue in accordance with paragraph B above, from the date the  proof of loss or demand for payment was transmitted to the Reinsurer.     2.

If the  debtor party prevails in an arbitration or other proceeding, then any interest charges due  hereunder on the amount in dispute shall be null and void.

C. If, during the Term of this Contract or thereafter, the Subscribing Reinsurer subsequently  remedies the applicable trigger(s) described in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of paragraph A  above which brought rise to the funding, the Company agrees to release those funds within  thirty days of the Company receiving proof of said remedy.

It is agreed, however, that the liquidator, receiver,  conservator or statutory successor of the Company shall give written notice to the  Reinsurer of the pendency of a claim against the Company indicating the policy or bond  reinsured which claim would involve a possible liability on the part of the Reinsurer within a  reasonable time after such claim is filed in the conservation or liquidation proceeding or in  </FONT></DIV>

The expense thus incurred by the  Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to the approval of the Court, against the Company  as part of the expense of conservation or liquidation to the extent of a pro rata share of the  benefit which may accrue to the Company solely as a result of the defense undertaken by  the Reinsurer.    B.

Article 24 - Arbitration  A. As a condition precedent to any right of action hereunder, in the event of any dispute or  difference of opinion hereafter arising with respect to this Contract, it is hereby mutually  agreed that such dispute or difference of opinion shall be submitted to arbitration.  One  Arbiter shall be chosen by the Company, the other by the Reinsurer, and an Umpire shall  be chosen by the two Arbiters before they enter upon arbitration, all of whom shall be active  or retired disinterested executive officers of insurance or reinsurance companies or Lloyd's  London Underwriters.  In the event that either party should fail to choose an Arbiter within  30 days following a written request by the other party to do so, the requesting party may  choose two Arbiters who shall in turn choose an Umpire before entering upon arbitration.  If  the two Arbiters fail to agree upon the selection of an Umpire within 30 days following their  appointment, each Arbiter shall nominate three candidates within 10 days thereafter, two of  whom the other shall decline, and the decision shall be made by drawing lots.    B. Each party shall present its case to the Arbiters within 30 days following the date of  appointment of the Umpire.  The Arbiters shall consider this Contract as an honorable  engagement rather than merely as a legal obligation and they are relieved of all judicial  formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.  The decision of the  Arbiters shall be final and binding on both parties; but failing to agree, they shall call in the  Umpire and the decision of the majority shall be final and binding upon both parties.   Judgment upon the final decision of the Arbiters may be entered in any court of competent  jurisdiction.    C.

C. Confidential Information may be used by the Reinsurer only in connection with the  performance of its obligations or enforcement of its rights under this Contract and will only  be disclosed when required by (1) retrocessionaires subject to the business ceded to this  Contract, (2) regulators performing an audit of the Reinsurer's records and/or financial  condition, or (3) external auditors performing an audit of the Reinsurer's records in the  normal course of business; provided that the Reinsurer advises such parties of the  confidential nature of the Confidential Information and their obligation to maintain its  confidentiality.  The Reinsurer shall be responsible for any breach of this provision by any  third-party representatives of the Reinsurer.  The Company requires that any third-party  representatives of the Reinsurer agree, in writing, to be bound by this Confidentiality Article  or by a separate written confidentiality agreement, containing terms no less stringent than  those set forth in this Article.    D. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that the Reinsurer is required by court order, other  legal process or any regulatory authority to release or disclose any or all of the Confidential  Information, the Reinsurer agrees to provide the Company with written notice of same at  least 10 days prior to such release or disclosure and to use its best efforts to assist the  Company in maintaining the confidentiality provided for in this Article.  </FONT></DIV>
