there are insufficient funds in such accounts to cover the applicable check or

requested, and the Swingline Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) elect to
make, a Swingline Advance at the Alternate Base Rate to pay such overdraft

Swingline Advances among the Lenders shall be as set forth in Section 2.4.3 and

                  2.4.3    Reallocation of Swingline Advances. Upon the election
of the Swingline Lender at any time, all outstanding Swingline Advances
designated by the Swingline Lender shall be reallocated among all Lenders in
accordance with each Lender's Commitment Percentage, and each such Swingline
Advance shall thereafter be deemed for all purposes a Fed Funds Advance.

         2.5      Bid Loans.

                  2.5.1    Solicitation of Bids. In addition to Primary Advances
and Swingline Advances hereunder, the Borrower may, at any time, solicit a bid
from any Lender on a non-pro rata basis for a Bid Loan in such amount and
accruing interest at such rate as may be bid directly to the Borrower by such
Lender for interest periods of 1 to 60 days. Such Lender, in its sole
discretion, may make such a bid. The Borrower will be under no obligation to
accept any such

                                       35
<PAGE>

bid, but may accept any one, or more than one, of such bids. A Lender whose bid
has been accepted by the Borrower shall be referred to as a "Bid Lender". The
Borrower and each Bid Lender shall execute and submit a Bid Loan Notice to the
Agent at the time of the Borrowing Notice for such Bid Loan. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no Bid Loans shall be made hereunder
after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default.

                  2.5.2    Availability. Any such loan made from a Bid Lender
under the terms of a bid shall be designated a "Bid Loan" and shall be subject
to the Lending Sublimits.

                  2.5.3    Separate From Commitment. Each Lender's commitment
under an accepted special bid shall be separate from such Lender's Commitment
and shall not reduce such Lender's obligation to continue to fund its Commitment
Percentage or its percentage of Swingline Advances, as the case may be, of any
other Advances hereunder.

                  2.5.4    Notes. Each Bid Loan owing to each Bid Lender shall
be evidenced by a promissory note or notes in form mutually agreed to by the
Borrower and such Bid Lender. The Agent shall have no responsibility to confirm
the existence or substance of such promissory notes.

                  2.5.5    Other Terms. Each Bid Lender shall be solely
responsible for determining the Bid Rate, establishing the prior notice required
for the Borrower to select, continue or convert any such Bid Rate, any interest
period with respect thereto and any fees or charges to the Borrower for
repayment of a Bid Loan prior to the end of any such interest period. Upon
receipt of written notice from a Bid Lender to the Agent that the Borrower is in
default under a Bid Loan Note and specifying the nature of such default, the
Agent shall give notice of such default under Article VII (to the extent
required therein) and such default under such Bid Loan Note shall give rise to a
Default after expiration of any applicable cure period under Article VII (to the
extent required therein).

         2.6      Reallocation Upon Default. At the request of any Lender given
after the occurrence of, and during the continuance of, a Default, all Advances
(other than Bid Loans) shall be reallocated among all Lenders, in accordance
with each Lender's Commitment Percentage, and all outstanding Swingline Advances
shall thereafter be deemed Alternate Base Rate Advances. Each Lender holding
less than its Commitment Percentage of all such Advances shall immediately
purchase for cash and at face value such participations in the Loans held by
other Lenders, and make such other adjustments, as may be needed to cause each
Lender to hold its Commitment Percentage of the Advances (other than Bid Loans).
No Lender shall be required to so purchase such participations to the extent
that such purchase would cause such Lender's share of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of all Loans (other than Bid Loans) then outstanding under this
Agreement to exceed its Commitment hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, after any such reallocation has occurred:
(i) the Swingline Commitment shall be zero and (ii) all future Advances, if any,
shall be made as Alternate Base Rate Advances.

         2.7      Fees. The Borrower shall pay the following fees (the "Fees"):

                                       36
<PAGE>

                  2.7.1    Facility Fees. A facility fee based on the Aggregate
Commitment from time to time from and after the date hereof, calculated at the
Facility Fee Rate, expressed as a per diem rate on the actual Aggregate
Commitment for each day during the preceding full or partial calendar quarter,
payable in arrears, on the last day of each calendar quarter and on the
Termination Date. This fee shall be paid to the Agent and allocated among the
Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective Commitments
during such quarter.

                  2.7.2    Collateral Shortfall Fees.

                           (1)      For each day on which a Gestation Shortfall
                  exists, a fee ("Gestation Fee") to the Lenders with Loans
                  outstanding in an amount equal to (A) 0.10% multiplied by (B)
                  such Gestation Shortfall and divided by (C) 360, which
                  Gestation Fee shall be allocated among the Lenders pro-rata in
                  proportion to their respective outstanding Loans on such day.

                           (2)      For each day on which a Warehouse Shortfall
                  exists, a fee (" Warehouse Shortfall Fee") to the Lenders with
                  Loans outstanding in an amount equal to (A) 0.15% multiplied
                  by (B) such Warehouse Shortfall and divided by (C) 360, which
                  Warehouse Shortfall Fee shall be allocated among such Lenders
                  pro-rata in proportion to their respective outstanding Loans
                  on such day. The Warehouse Shortfall Fee is in addition to any
                  Gestation Shortfall Fee which may be due.

                           (3)      Notwithstanding the fact that the Gestation
                  Fee and Warehouse Shortfall Fee shall be calculated and
                  accrued daily, such Collateral Fee shall be payable in arrears
                  on the fifth Business Day of each month and upon the
                  Termination Date.

                  2.7.3    Amendment Fee. An amendment fee of $2,500 to each
Lender for each material amendment (as determined in the sole and absolute
discretion of the Agent) to this Agreement other than amendments required to be
made under Section 2.10(b) of this Agreement (provided that with respect to each
amendment, such fee shall only be due to Lenders that sign such amendment by the
date requested by the Agent).

                  2.7.4    Agent Fees. Any fees payable to the Agent pursuant to
the Borrower's prior letter agreement with the Agent dated February 10, 2003.

                  2.7.5    Collateral Agent Fees. Any fees payable to Collateral
Agent for its services rendered pursuant to the Security Agreement as agreed to
by the Borrower and charged by Collateral Agent from time to time.

                  2.7.6    Fees Payable in connection with Buy-Down Loans and
Bid Loans. The Borrower shall pay any fees and other charges when due (i) to any
Buy-Down Lender under a Buy-Down Agreement as described in Section 2.3, and (ii)
to any Bid Lender which the Borrower has agreed to pay in connection with Bid
Loans made available by such Lender.

         2.8      Method of Selecting Types and Interest Periods for New
Advances. The Borrower shall select the Type of Advance and, in the case of each
Eurodollar Advance, the

                                       37
<PAGE>

Interest Period applicable to each Advance from time to time. The Borrower shall
give the Agent irrevocable notice (a "Borrowing Notice") not later than (i)
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Borrowing Date of each Alternate Base Rate
Advance or Fed Funds Advance, (ii) 2:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the proposed
Borrowing Date for each Bid Loan (or at such earlier time as may be required by
the terms of a Bid Loan Notice to the Bid Lender and the Agent), (iii) 4:00 p.m.
(Chicago time) on the proposed Borrowing Date for each Swingline Advance, and
(v) 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three Business Days before the Borrowing
Date for each Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

         (a)      the Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day, of such
                  Advance,

         (b)      the aggregate amount of such Advance, which shall be in an
                  amount equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000
                  in excess thereof, except that Swingline Advances shall be in
                  a minimum amount of $100,000 but need not be in multiples of
                  $100,000,

         (c)      the Type of Advance selected,

         (d)      in the case of each Eurodollar Advance, the Interest Period
                  applicable thereto, and

         (e)      if such Advance is a Bid Loan, all of the information required
                  under a Bid Loan Notice.

Not later than noon (Chicago time) on each Borrowing Date, with respect to all
Advances other than Swingline Advances and Bid Loans, each Lender shall make
available its Loan or Loans comprising such Advance, in funds immediately
available in Chicago to the Agent at its address specified pursuant to Article
XIII; provided that Bid Loans may be made available at any time up to 3:30 p.m.
(Chicago time) and Swingline Advances may be made available up to the close of
business. The Agent will make the funds so received from the Lenders available
to the Borrower at the Agent's aforesaid address.

         2.9      Conversion and Continuation of Outstanding Advances. An
Alternate Base Rate Advance shall continue as an Alternate Base Rate Advance
unless and until such Alternate Base Rate Advance is converted into another Type
of Advance (other than a Swingline Advance or a Bid Loan). A Fed Funds Advance
shall continue as a Fed Funds Advance unless and until (a) such Advance is
converted into a different Type of Advance (other than a Swingline Advance or a
Bid Loan) in accordance with the terms hereof or (b) the Borrower has paid any
such Fed Funds Advance prior to 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on any Business Day. A
Swingline Advance shall continue as a Swingline Advance unless and until the
Borrower has paid such Swingline Advance prior to 3:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on
any Business Day. Each Eurodollar Advance shall continue as a Eurodollar Advance
until the end of the then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time
such Eurodollar Advance shall be automatically converted into an Alternate Base
Rate Advance unless the Borrower shall have given the Agent a
Conversion/Continuation Notice requesting that, at the end of such Interest
Period, such Eurodollar Advance either continue as a Eurodollar Advance for the
same or another Interest Period or be converted into an Advance of another Type
(other than a Swingline Advance or a Bid Loan). Bid Loans and Swingline Advances
may be repaid out of new Advances hereunder but may not be converted directly to
a

                                       38
<PAGE>

different Type of Advance. The Borrower may elect from time to time to convert
all or any part of an Advance of any Type (other than a Swingline Advance or a
Bid Loan) into any other Type or Types of Advances (other than a Swingline
Advance or a Bid Loan); provided that any conversion of any Eurodollar Advance
shall be made on, and only on, the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto. The Borrower shall give the Agent irrevocable notice (a
"Conversion/Continuation Notice") of each conversion of an Alternate Base Rate
Advance or Fed Funds Advance or conversion or continuation of a Eurodollar
Advance not later than (i) 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of the
requested conversion, in the case of a conversion into an Alternate Base Rate
Advance or Fed Funds Advance or (ii) 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three
Business Days prior to the date of the requested conversion into or continuation
of a Eurodollar Advance, specifying:

                  (i)      the requested date which shall be a Business Day, of
         such conversion or continuation,

                  (ii)     the aggregate amount (which meets the minimums set
         forth in Section 2.8(b)) and Type of the Advance which is to be
         converted or continued, and

                  (iii)    the amount and Type(s) of Advance(s) into which such
         Advance is to be converted or continued and, in the case of a
         conversion into or continuation of a Eurodollar Advance, the duration
         of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

         2.10     (a)      Reductions to Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower may
from time to time permanently reduce the Aggregate Commitment in whole, or in
part ratably among the Lenders in integral multiples of $5,000,000, upon at
least ten Business Days' written notice to the Agent, which notice shall specify
the amount of any such reduction. On or before the effective date of any such
reduction, the Borrower shall, if necessary, repay sufficient Loans to prevent
the remaining outstanding Loans hereunder, after giving effect to such permanent
reduction, from exceeding the Lending Sublimits. Upon any reduction of the
Aggregate Commitment, upon the election of the Swingline Lender, the reduction
in such Lender's Commitment may also reduce its Swingline Commitment on a pro
rata basis.

                  (b)      Optional Increases in Aggregate Commitment. The
Borrower shall have the right to temporarily increase the Aggregate Commitment
from its then-current level by up to $175,000,000, but not to an amount in
excess of $350,000,000 and not for a period in excess of 45 days, by obtaining
an additional Commitment or Commitments from one or more of the Lenders,
provided that (A) the Borrower has given the Lenders notice of any increase in
the Aggregate Commitment and the amount of any increase in a Lender's Commitment
at least two (2) Business Days prior to any such increase, and (B) the Agent has
received an "Amendment to Credit Agreement" in the form of Exhibit K, which
amendment shall be executed by the Borrower, the Agent and any Lender increasing
its Commitment thereby, provided further that the Borrower shall not be
permitted to temporarily increase the Aggregate Commitment more than four times
in any calendar year. Each such amendment shall be deemed to amend Schedule "1"
to the extent necessary to reflect any changes in the Commitments hereunder, and
the Agent shall promptly deliver a copy of such amendment to each Lender whose
Commitment Percentage is affected thereby. On the Business Day following any
such increase, all outstanding Fed Funds Advances and Alternate Base Rate
Advances shall be reallocated among the Lenders in

                                       39
<PAGE>

accordance with the Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages. Except as
otherwise provided in Section 2.6, Eurodollar Advances shall not be reallocated
among the Lenders prior to the expiration of the applicable Interest Period in
effect at the time of any such increase.

         (c)      Permanent Increases to Aggregate Commitment. The Borrower
shall have the right to permanently increase the Aggregate Commitment by
obtaining additional Commitments, either from one or more of the Lenders or
another lending institution provided that (A) the Agent has approved the
identity of any such new Lender, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
(B) any such new Lender assumes all of the rights and obligations of a "Lender"
hereunder, and (C) the procedure described in this Section 2.10.(c) has been
complied with, provided further that the Aggregate Commitment shall not at any
time exceed $350,000,000 without the approval of the Agent and all of the
Lenders. Any amendment hereto for such an increase or addition shall be in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit "N" and shall only require the written
signatures of the Agent, the Borrower and the Lender(s) being added or
increasing their Commitment, subject only to the approval of all Lenders if any
such increase would cause the Aggregate Commitment to exceed $350,000,000. In
addition, within a reasonable time after the effective date of any increase, the
Agent shall, and is hereby authorized and directed to, revise Schedule "1'
reflecting such increase and shall distribute such revised Schedule to each of
the Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon such revised Schedule shall replace the
old Schedule and become part of this Agreement. On the Business Day following
any such increase, all outstanding Fed Funds Advances and Alternate Base Rate
Advances shall be reallocated among the Lenders (including any newly added
Lenders) in accordance with the Lenders' respective revised Commitment
Percentages. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.6, Eurodollar Advances
shall not be reallocated among the Lenders prior to the expiration of the
applicable Interest Period in effect at the time of any such increase.

         2.11     Principal Payments.

                  2.11.1   Optional Principal Payments. The Borrower may from
time to time pay, without penalty or premium, all outstanding Alternate Base
Rate Advances or Fed Funds Advances, or, in a minimum aggregate amount of
$100,000 or any integral multiple of $100,000 or excess thereof, any portion of
the outstanding Alternate Base Rate Advances or Fed Funds Advances upon prior
written notice to the Agent (and if a Fed Funds Advance, within the timeframe
described below). The Borrower may from time to time pay, subject to the payment
of any funding indemnification amounts required by Section 3.4 but without
penalty or premium, all outstanding Eurodollar Advances, or, in a minimum
aggregate amount of $500,000 or any integral multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof, any portion of the outstanding Eurodollar Advances upon three Business
Days' prior notice to the Agent. Fed Funds Advances and Swingline Advances may
be paid on any Business Day provided that the Borrower has given the Agent
written notice of such repayment on the date of such intended payment by (i)
10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) for Fed Funds Advances and (ii) noon (Chicago time)
for Swingline Advances. All optional principal payments shall be applied to the
Type of Advance designated by the Borrower when making such payment, provided
that any payments received during the continuance of a Default and after Section
2.6 has been invoked shall be applied on a pro rata basis to all Advances then
outstanding. Payments so allocated to an Advance shall be distributed to the
Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Advance on a pro rata basis in
accordance with the respective unpaid principal balances of such Loans.

                                       40
<PAGE>

                  2.11.2   Required Payments Related to Borrowing Base. On any
date that the aggregate unpaid principal amount outstanding under this Agreement
is in excess of the then-current Borrowing Base, the Borrower shall, prior to
the close of business on such date, either deliver sufficient Eligible
Collateral to eliminate such excess or make a mandatory payment to the Agent for
the benefit of the Lenders in the amount of such excess. Any such payment shall
be allocated as directed by the Borrower unless a Default then exists and
Section 2.6 has been invoked in which case such payment shall be allocated in
accordance with the Lenders' respective outstanding Loans and in conjunction
with the procedures described in Section 2.6, with such payments applied first
to accrued interest and thereafter to principal.

                  2.11.3   Settlement Account Payments. Prior to the occurrence
of a Default, to the extent the amounts in the Settlement Account are not needed
to keep the Borrowing Base equal to or greater than the aggregate unpaid
principal amount outstanding under this Agreement, the Borrower may withdraw or
otherwise direct the application of such amounts. Upon the occurrence of a
Default (and during the continuance thereof), the Agent may declare a portion of
the principal balance of the Loans, equal to any amounts then on deposit in the
Settlement Account and any deposits made in the Settlement Account during the
continuance of such Default, to be due and payable without demand (unless
previously declared due and payable). Such amount shall be withdrawn from the
Settlement Account by the Agent and shall be applied to the Obligations.

                  2.11.4   Final Payment on Termination Date. Any outstanding
Advances and all other unpaid Obligations, unless required to be paid earlier
pursuant to the terms hereof, shall be paid in full by the Borrower on the
Termination Date.

                  2.11.5   Pulte Change in Control. If a Pulte Change in Control
shall occur, all Commitments shall be terminated and all amounts outstanding
under this Agreement shall become due and payable upon the election of the
Required Lenders.

         2.12     Changes in Interest Rate, etc. Each Alternate Base Rate
Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for
each day from and including the date such Advance is made or is automatically
converted from a Eurodollar Advance into an Alternate Base Rate Advance pursuant
to Section 2.9, to but excluding the date it is paid or is converted into a
Eurodollar Advance pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to
the Alternate Base Rate for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that
portion of any Advance maintained as an Alternate Base Rate Advance will take
effect simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. The interest
rate on each Swingline Advance or Fed Funds Advance shall be recalculated daily
for each day that such Swingline Advance or Fed Funds Advance is continued under
Section 2.9. Each Eurodollar Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from and including the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period
at the interest rate determined by the Agent as applicable to such Eurodollar
Advance based upon the Borrower's selections under Section 2.8 and 2.9 and
otherwise in accordance with the terms hereof. Not more than four (4) different
Interest Periods may be in effect at any time and no Interest Period may end
after the Termination Date.

                                       41
<PAGE>

         2.13     Rates Applicable After Default. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in Section 2.8 or 2.9, during the continuance of a
Default or Unmatured Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by
notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 9.1 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to reductions in interest rates), declare that
no Advance may be made as, converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Advance.
During the continuance of a Default the Required Lenders may, at their option,
by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 9.1 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to reductions in interest rates) declare that
(i) each Eurodollar Advance (unless such Advances have been reallocated pursuant
to Section 2.6) shall bear interest for the remainder of the applicable Interest
Period at the rate otherwise applicable to such Interest Period plus 2% per
annum and (ii) each Advance (other than those under clause (i) above) shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus 2% per annum;
provided that, during the continuance of a Default under Section 7.6 or 7.7, the
interest rates set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be applicable to
all Advances without any election or action on the part of the Agent or any
Lender.

         2.14     Method of Payment. All payments of the Obligations hereunder
shall be made, without setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately
available funds to the Agent at the Agent's address specified pursuant to
Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Agent specified in
writing by the Agent to the Borrower, on the date when due by (i) noon (Chicago
time) with respect to all Advances other than Swingline Advances and (ii) 4:00
p.m. (Chicago time) with respect to Swingline Advances and all such payments
shall be applied in accordance with Section 2.11.1. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if the Borrower fails to give the Agent notice of repayment of a Fed
Funds Advance before 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Business Day that the
Borrower intends to repay such Fed Funds Advance, any payment of such Fed Funds
Advance received by the Agent on such Business Day shall be deemed to have been
received by the Agent at the opening of business on the following Business Day.
Each payment delivered to the Agent for the account of any Lender shall be
delivered promptly by the Agent to such Lender in the same type of funds that
the Agent received at its address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any
Lending Installation specified in a notice received by the Agent from such
Lender. The Agent is hereby authorized to charge the account of the Borrower
maintained with Bank One for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it
becomes due hereunder.

         2.15     Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness.

                  (i)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its
         usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of
         the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such
         Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and
         interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

                  (ii)     Subject to Section 2.3, the Agent shall also maintain
         accounts in which it will record (a) the amount of each Loan made
         hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period with respect
         thereto, (b) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
         to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder
         and (c) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the
         Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

                                       42
<PAGE>

                  (iii)    The entries maintained in the accounts maintained
         pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (ii) above shall be prima facie evidence
         of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;
         provided, however, that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to
         maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner
         affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Obligations in
         accordance with their terms.

                  (iv)     Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by
         a Note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
         to such Lender a Note payable to the order of such Lender. Thereafter,
         the Loans evidenced by such Note and interest thereon shall at all
         times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.3) be
         represented by one or more Notes payable to the order of the payee
         named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 12.3, except to the
         extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such
         Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be
         evidenced as described in paragraphs (i) and (ii) above.

         2.16     Telephonic Notices. The Borrower hereby authorizes the Lenders
and the Agent to extend, convert or continue Advances, effect selections of
Types of Advances and to transfer funds based on telephonic notices made by any
person or persons the Agent or any Lender in good faith believes to be acting on
behalf of the Borrower, it being understood that the foregoing authorization is
specifically intended to allow Borrowing Notices and Conversion/Continuation
Notices to be given telephonically. The Borrower agrees to deliver promptly to
the Agent a written confirmation, if such confirmation is requested by the Agent
or any Lender, of each telephonic notice signed by an Authorized Officer. If the
written confirmation differs in any material respect from the action taken by
the Agent and the Lenders, the records of the Agent and the Lenders shall govern
absent manifest error.

         2.17     Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Subject to
Section 2.3, interest shall be payable in accordance with the following
provisions. Interest accrued on each Advance other than a Bid Loan or a
Eurodollar Advance shall be payable on each Payment Date, commencing with the
first such date to occur after the date hereof and at maturity. Interest accrued
on each Eurodollar Advance or Bid Loan shall be payable on the last day of its
applicable Interest Period, on any date on which the Eurodollar Advance or Bid
Loan is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise, and at maturity. Interest
accrued on each Eurodollar Advance or Bid Loan having an Interest Period longer
than three months shall also be payable on the last day of each three-month
interval during such Interest Period. Interest and Fees shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year. Interest shall be payable
for the day an Advance is made but not for the day of any payment on the amount
paid if payment is received at the place of payment prior to the time required
for payment as set forth in Section 2.14. If any payment of principal of or
interest on an Advance shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case
of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be included in computing
interest in connection with such payment.

         2.18     Notification by the Agent. Promptly after receipt thereof, the
Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Aggregate Commitment
reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice, and
repayment notice received by it hereunder. Promptly upon determination thereof,
the Agent will notify each Lender making a portion of any Eurodollar

                                       43
<PAGE>

Advance and the Borrower of the interest rate applicable to each Eurodollar
Advance. When any Fed Funds Advances or Alternate Base Rate Advances are
outstanding or have been requested, the Agent will give each Lender making or
holding any such Loans and the Borrower prompt notice of each change in such
rates.

         2.19     Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be
deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of such Lending Installation. Each
Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with
Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending Installation through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

         2.20     Non-Receipt of Funds by the Agent. Unless the Borrower or a
Lender, as the case may be, notifies the Agent prior to the date on which it is
scheduled to make payment to the Agent of (i) in the case of a Lender, the
proceeds of a Loan or an Advance or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, a payment
of principal (including but not limited to situations in which the Borrower
informs the Agent that the Agent will be receiving proceeds of Collateral on a
specific date and that the Borrower intends to use such proceeds to make a
payment of principal), interest or Fees to the Agent for the account of the
Lenders, that it does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that
such payment has been made. The Agent may, but shall not be obligated to, make
the amount of such payment available to the intended recipient in reliance upon
such assumption. If such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may be, has not in
fact made such payment to the Agent, the recipient of such payment shall, on
demand by the Agent, repay to the Agent the amount so made available together
with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the
date such amount was so made available by the Agent until the date the Agent
recovers such amount at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of payment due
from a Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day for the first three
days and, thereafter, the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan or (y)
in the case of payment due from the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to
the relevant Loan.

                                  ARTICLE III
                             CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES

         3.1      Yield Protection. If, on or after the date of this Agreement,
the adoption of any law or any governmental or quasi-governmental rule,
regulation, policy, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law), or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental or quasi-governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
Lender or applicable Lending Installation with any request or directive (whether
or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency:

                  (i)      subjects any Lender or any applicable Lending
         Installation to any Taxes or changes the basis of taxation of payments
         (other than with respect to Excluded Taxes) to any Lender in respect of
         its Eurodollar Loans, or

                                       44
<PAGE>

                  (ii)     imposes or increases or deems applicable any reserve,
         assessment, insurance charge, special deposit or similar requirement
         against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
         extended by, any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation (other
         than reserves and assessments taken into account in determining the
         interest rate applicable to Eurodollar Advances), or

                  (iii)    imposes any other condition the result of which is to
         increase the cost to any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
         of making, funding or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or reduces any
         amount receivable by any Lender or any applicable Lending Installation
         in connection with its Eurodollar Loans, or requires any Lender or any
         applicable Lending Installation to make any payment calculated by
         reference to the amount of its Eurodollar Loans held or interest
         received by it, by an amount deemed material by such Lender,

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender or
applicable Lending Installation of making or maintaining its Eurodollar Loans or
Commitment or to reduce the return received by such Lender or applicable Lending
Installation in connection with such Eurodollar Loans or Commitment, then,
within 15 days of demand by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased
cost or reduction in an amount received.

         3.2      Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations. If a Lender
determines the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such
Lender, any Lending Installation of such Lender or any corporation controlling
such Lender is increased as a result of a Change, then, within 15 days of demand
by such Lender, the Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount necessary to
compensate for any shortfall in the rate of return on the portion of such
increased capital which such Lender determines is attributable to this
Agreement, its Loans or its Commitment to make Loans hereunder (after taking
into account such Lender's policies as to capital adequacy). "Change" means (i)
any change after the date of this Agreement in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines
or (ii) any adoption of or change in any other law, governmental or
quasi-governmental rule, regulation, policy, guideline, interpretation, or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) after the date of this
Agreement which affects the amount of capital required or expected to be
maintained by any Lender or any Lending Installation or any corporation
controlling any Lender. "Risk-Based Capital Guidelines" means (i) the risk-based
capital guidelines in effect in the United States on the date of this Agreement,
including transition rules, and (ii) the corresponding capital regulations
promulgated by regulatory authorities outside the United States implementing the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulation and Supervisory
Practices Entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurements and
Capital Standards," including transition rules, and any amendments to such
regulations adopted prior to the date of this Agreement.

         3.3      Availability of Types of Advances. If any Lender determines
that maintenance of its Eurodollar Loans at a suitable Lending Installation
would violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, or directive, whether or not
having the force of law, or if the Required Lenders determine that (i) deposits
of a type and maturity appropriate to match fund Eurodollar Advances or Fed
Funds Advances are not available or (ii) the interest rate applicable to a Type
of Advance does not accurately reflect the cost of making or maintaining such
Advance, then the Agent shall

                                       45
<PAGE>

suspend the availability of the affected Type of Advance and require any
Advances of the affected Type to be repaid or converted to Alternate Base Rate
Advances, subject to the payment of any funding indemnification amounts required
by Section 3.4.

         3.4      Funding Indemnification. If any payment of a Eurodollar
Advance occurs on a date which is not the last day of the applicable Interest
Period, whether because of acceleration, prepayment or otherwise, or a
Eurodollar Advance is not made, continued or converted on the date specified by
the Borrower for any reason other than default by the Lenders, the Borrower will
indemnify each Lender for any loss or cost incurred by it resulting therefrom,
including, without limitation, any loss or cost in liquidating or employing
deposits acquired to fund or maintain the Eurodollar Advance.

         3.5      Taxes.

                  (i)      All payments by the Borrower to or for the account of
         any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made free
         and clear of and without deduction for any and all Taxes. If the
         Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in
         respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender or the Agent, (a)
         the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making
         all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional
         sums payable under this Section 3.5) such Lender or the Agent (as the
         case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
         had no such deductions been made, (b) the Borrower shall make such
         deductions, (c) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
         relevant authority in accordance with applicable law and (d) the
         Borrower shall furnish to the Agent the original copy of a receipt
         evidencing payment thereof within 30 days after such payment is made.

                  (ii)     In addition, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay any
         present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or
         property taxes, charges or similar levies which arise from any payment
         made hereunder or under any Note or from the execution or delivery of,
         or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or any Note ("Other
         Taxes").

                  (iii)    The Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify the Agent and
         each Lender for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including,
         without limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on amounts payable
         under this Section 3.5) paid by the Agent or such Lender and any
         liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising
         therefrom or with respect thereto. Payments due under this
         indemnification shall be made within 30 days of the date the Agent or
         such Lender makes demand therefor pursuant to Section 3.6.

                  (iv)     Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws
         of the United States of America or a state thereof (each a "Non-U.S.
         Lender") agrees that it will, not less than ten Business Days after the
         date of this Agreement, (i) deliver to each of the Borrower and the
         Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
         Service Form 1001 or 4224, certifying in either case that such Lender
         is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction
         or withholding of any United States federal income taxes, and (ii)
         deliver to each of the Borrower and the Agent a United

                                       46
<PAGE>

         States Internal Revenue Form W-8 or W-9, as the case may be, and
         certify that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
         withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to
         each of the Borrower and the Agent (x) renewals or additional copies of
         such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form
         expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event
         requiring a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such
         additional forms or amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested
         by the Borrower or the Agent. All forms or amendments described in the
         preceding sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to
         receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding
         of any United States federal income taxes, unless an event (including
         without limitation any change in treaty, law or regulation) has
         occurred prior to the date on which any such delivery would otherwise
         be required which renders all such forms inapplicable or which would
         prevent such Lender from duly completing and delivering any such form
         or amendment with respect to it and such Lender advises the Borrower
         and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
         deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

                  (v)      For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has
         failed to provide the Borrower with an appropriate form pursuant to
         clause (iv), above (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty,
         law or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or
         administration thereof by any governmental authority, occurring
         subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be
         provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to
         indemnification under this Section 3.5 with respect to Taxes imposed by
         the United States; provided that, should a Non-U.S. Lender which is
         otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate of withholding tax
         become subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a form
         required under clause (iv), above, the Borrower shall take such steps
         as such Non-U.S. Lender shall reasonably request to assist such
         Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.

                  (vi)     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
         reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under this
         Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of any relevant jurisdiction
         or any treaty shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent),
         at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly
         completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as
         will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a
         reduced rate.

                  (vii)    If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other
         governmental authority of the United States or any other country or any
         political subdivision thereof asserts a claim that the Agent did not
         properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any
         Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or properly
         completed, because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change
         in circumstances which rendered its exemption from withholding
         ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender shall indemnify the
         Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent
         as tax, withholding therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and
         interest, and including taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
         payable to the Agent under this subsection, together with all costs and
         expenses related thereto (including attorneys fees and time charges of
         attorneys for the Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the

                                       47
<PAGE>

         Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 3.5(vii)
         shall survive the payment of the Obligations and termination of this
         Agreement.

         3.6      Lender Statements; Survival of Indemnity.

                  (i)      To the extent reasonably possible, each Lender shall
         designate an alternate Lending Installation with respect to its
         Eurodollar Loans to reduce any liability of the Borrower to such Lender
         under Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.5 or to avoid the unavailability of a
         Type of Advance under Section 3.3, so long as such designation is not,
         in the judgment of such Lender, disadvantageous to such Lender. Each
         Lender shall deliver a written statement of such Lender to the Borrower
         (with a copy to the Agent) as to the amount due, if any, under Section
         3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5. Such written statement shall set forth in
         reasonable detail the calculations upon which such Lender determined
         such amount and shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Borrower
         in the absence of manifest error. Determination of amounts payable
         under such Sections in connection with a Eurodollar Loan shall be
         calculated as though each Lender funded its Eurodollar Loan through the
         purchase of a deposit of the type and maturity corresponding to the
         deposit used as a reference in determining the Eurodollar Rate
         applicable to such Loan, whether in fact that is the case or not.
         Unless otherwise provided herein, the amount specified in the written
         statement of any Lender shall be payable within fifteen (15) days after
         receipt by the Borrower of such written statement. The obligations of
         the Borrower under Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 shall survive payment
         of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

                  (ii)     If the Borrower is required pursuant to Section 3.1,
         3.2, or 3.5 to make any additional payment to any Lender or if any
         Lender's obligation to make or continue a Type of Advance shall be
         suspended pursuant to Section 3.3 (any Lender so affected an "Affected
         Lender"), the Borrower may elect, if such amounts continue to be
         charged or such suspension is still effective, to replace such Affected
         Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that no Default or
         Unmatured Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of
         such replacement, and provided further that, concurrently with such
         replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably
         satisfactory to the Borrower and the Agent shall agree, as of such
         date, to purchase for cash the Advances and other Obligations due to
         the Affected Lender and to become a Lender for all purposes under this
         Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Affected Lender to be
         terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of
         Section 12.3 applicable to assignments, and (ii) the Borrower shall pay
         to such Affected Lender in same day funds on the day of such
         replacement (A) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but
         unpaid to such Affected Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and
         including the date of termination, including without limitation
         payments due to such Affected Lender under Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.5,
         and (B) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been
         due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under Section 3.4 had
         the Loans of such Affected Lender been prepaid on such date rather than
         sold to the replacement Lender.

         which the Borrower is a party, upon which certificate the Agent and the
         Lenders shall be entitled to rely until informed of any change in
         writing by the Borrower.

                  (iv)     A good standing certificate for the Borrower from the
         Secretary of State of its state of organization.

         behalf of the lenders under the Prior Facilities and the Lenders under
         this Agreement as to the repayment or conversion of loans outstanding
         to the Borrower under the Prior Facilities and, the treatment of any
         interest and fees accrued thereon (the "Transition Memorandum").

<PAGE>

                  (xi)     Payment of all Fees due and payable on or before the
         Effective Date.

         have reasonably requested.

         4.2      Each Advance. The Lenders shall not be required to make any
Advance (other than an Advance that, after giving effect thereto and to the
application of the proceeds thereof, does not increase the aggregate amount of
outstanding Advances; provided that the conditions contained in this Section
must be met for any Advance which refunds a Bid Loan), unless on the applicable
Borrowing Date:

                  (i)      There exists no Default or Unmatured Default.

         is stated to relate solely to an earlier date, in which case such
         representation or warranty shall have been true and correct in all
         material respects on and as of such earlier date.

                  (iii)    All legal matters incident to the making of such
         Advance shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Lenders and their
         counsel.

         Each Borrowing Notice with respect to each such Advance shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower that each Pledged Item
included in the Borrowing Base constitutes Eligible Collateral, and that after
giving effect to the amount of the Advance being requested, (a) the conditions
contained in Sections 4.2(i) and (ii) have been satisfied, (b) the Borrower has
provided the Collateral Agent with the true and correct information including
the GAAP Carrying Values (correctly calculated in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement) necessary to calculate the Collateral Value for all Eligible
Collateral, (c) the then current Borrowing Base is equal to or greater than the
aggregate unpaid principal amount outstanding under this Agreement and (d) no
Lending Sublimit has been exceeded.

                                   ARTICLE V
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

         5.1      Existence and Standing. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership (in the case of Subsidiaries only) or
limited liability company duly and properly incorporated or organized, as the
case may be, validly existing and (to the extent such concept applies to such
entity) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and, except for the State of Missouri and the State of Rhode
Island, has all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction
in which its business is conducted.

                                       50
<PAGE>

The failure of Borrower and its Subsidiaries to be authorized to conduct
business in Missouri and Rhode Island could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect

         5.2      Authorization and Validity. The Borrower has the power and
authority to execute and deliver the Loan Documents and to perform its
obligations thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Borrower of the Loan
Documents and the performance of its obligations thereunder have been duly
authorized by proper limited liability company proceedings, and the Loan
Documents to which the Borrower is a party constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Borrower enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with
their terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency
or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

         5.3      No Conflict; Government Consent. Neither the execution and
delivery by the Borrower of the Loan Documents nor the consummation of the
transactions therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions thereof
will violate (i) any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree or award binding on the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries if any such
violation could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business or financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole or (ii) the Borrower's or any Subsidiary's articles or certificate of
incorporation, partnership agreement, certificate of partnership, articles or
certificate of organization, by-laws, or operating or other management
agreement, as the case may be, or (iii) the provisions of any indenture,
instrument or agreement to which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or is subject, or by which it, or its Property, is bound, or conflict with
or constitute a default thereunder if any such violation, conflict or default
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the business
or financial condition of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or
result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien in, of or on the
Property of the Borrower or a Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of any such
indenture, instrument or agreement. No order, consent, adjudication, approval,
license, authorization, or validation of, or filing, recording or registration
with, or exemption by, or other action in respect of any governmental or public
body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, which has not been obtained by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is required to be obtained by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of the Loan Documents, the borrowings under this Agreement, the payment
and performance by the Borrower of the Obligations or the legality, validity,
binding effect or enforceability of any of the Loan Documents (other than
filings to perfect the Liens granted pursuant to the Security Agreement).

         5.4      Financial Statements. The December 31, 2002 consolidated
financial statements of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries heretofore delivered
to the Lenders were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the date such
statements were prepared and fairly present the consolidated financial condition
and operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries at such date and the
consolidated results of their operations for the period then ended.

         5.5      Material Adverse Change. Since December 31, 2002, there has
been no change in the business, Property, financial condition or results of
operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                                       51
<PAGE>

         5.6      Taxes. The Borrower and, to its knowledge, its Subsidiaries
have filed all United States federal tax returns and all other tax returns which
are required to be filed and have paid all taxes due pursuant to said returns or
pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
except such taxes, if any, as are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in accordance
with Agreement Accounting Principles and as to which no Lien exists. No material
tax liens have been filed and no material claims are being asserted with respect
to any such taxes. The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries in respect of any taxes or other governmental
charges are adequate. Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries that is
a limited liability company qualifies for disregarded entity tax treatment under
United States federal tax law.

         5.7      Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as set forth on
Schedule "3" hereto and as otherwise disclosed in the Borrower's annual
financial statements referred to in Section 5.4, there is no litigation,
arbitration, governmental investigation, proceeding or inquiry pending or, to
the knowledge of any of their executive officers, threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which (i) in the Borrower's
reasonable judgment have a reasonable possibility of being determined adversely
to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, and (ii) if so determined adversely to the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, would be reasonably likely to,
singly or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, or on the respective properties or operations, of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Security Agreement and the Notes. Other than any liability
incident to any litigation, arbitration or proceeding which could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower has no material
contingent obligations not provided for or disclosed in the financial statements
referred to in Section 5.4.

         5.8      Subsidiaries. Schedule "4" hereto contains an accurate list of
all Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of the date of this Agreement, setting forth
their respective jurisdictions of organization and the percentage of their
respective capital stock or other ownership interests owned by the Borrower or
other Subsidiaries. All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or
other ownership interests of such Subsidiaries have been (to the extent such
concepts are relevant with respect to such ownership interests) duly authorized
and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

         5.9      ERISA. The Unfunded Liabilities of all Single Employer Plans
do not in the aggregate exceed $500,000. Neither the Borrower nor any other
member of the Controlled Group has incurred, or is reasonably expected to incur,
any withdrawal liability to Multi-employer Plans in excess of $500,000 in the
aggregate. Each Plan complies in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of law and regulations, no Reportable Event has occurred with
respect to any Plan, neither the Borrower nor any other members of the
Controlled Group has withdrawn from any Plan or initiated steps to do so, and no
steps have been taken to reorganize or terminate any Plan.

         5.10     Accuracy of Information. No information, exhibit or report
furnished by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries to the Agent or to any
Lender in connection with the negotiation of, or compliance with, the Loan
Documents contained any material misstatement of

                                       52

<PAGE>

fact or omitted to state a material fact or any fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein not misleading.

         5.11     Regulation U. Margin stock (as defined in Regulation U)
constitutes less than 25% of the value of those assets of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries which are subject to any limitation on sale, pledge, or other
restriction hereunder.

         5.12     Material Agreements. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary
is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default in the
performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants or
conditions contained in (i) any agreement to which it is a party, which default
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any
agreement or instrument evidencing or governing Indebtedness or any Rate
Management Transaction.

         5.13     Compliance With Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
complied with all applicable statutes, rules, regulations, orders and
restrictions of any domestic or foreign government or any instrumentality or
agency thereof, having jurisdiction over the conduct of their respective
businesses or the ownership of their respective Property except for any failure
to comply with any of the foregoing which could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.14     Ownership of Properties. Except as set forth on Schedule "5"
hereto, on the date of this Agreement, the Borrower and its Subsidiaries will
have good title, free of all Liens other than those permitted by Section 6.15,
to all of the Property and assets reflected in the financial statements provided
to the Agent as owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

         5.15     Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions. The Borrower is not an
entity deemed to hold "plan assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
which is subject to Title I of ERISA or any plan (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code), and neither the execution of this Agreement nor the making of
Loans hereunder gives rise to a prohibited transaction within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

         5.16     Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company", within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

         5.17     Public Utility Holding Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary is a "holding company" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding
company", or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of a "subsidiary company"
of a "holding company", within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended.

         5.18     GNMA, FHA, VA, FNMA, and FHLMC Eligibility. The Borrower is:
(i) an FHA-Approved Mortgagee in good standing, a VA-Approved Lender, a
FHLMC-Approved Lender and a FNMA-Approved Lender and meets all eligible
requirements of law and governmental regulation so as to be eligible to
originate, purchase, hold and service Mortgage Loans insured by FHA or
supporting any Security; (ii) an approved seller and servicer in good

                                       53

<PAGE>

standing of Mortgage Loans to each Federal Agency; and (iii) an approved issuer
and servicer in good standing of Securities for FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA and meets
all FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA requirements, requirements of law and governmental
regulations so as to be able to issue Securities and to originate and service
the Mortgage Loans that secure such Securities.

         5.19     Approved Investor Commitments. The forms of Approved Investor
Commitment with respect to Mortgage Loans, other than Conforming Mortgage Loans,
which were delivered to the Agent on the Effective Date are still valid and
currently in use and, except to the extent new forms or changes to the existing
forms of Approved Investor Commitment have been delivered to the Agent,
represent the only forms of Approved Investor Commitment used by the Borrower
for such purposes.

         5.20     Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in each other document
delivered in connection with this Agreement are, or when such document is
delivered will be, true and correct in all material respects when made.

         5.21     No Defaults. No Default or Unmatured Default has occurred and
is continuing.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                                    COVENANTS

         During the term of this Agreement, unless the Required Lenders shall
otherwise consent in writing:

         6.1      Financial Reporting. The Borrower will maintain, for itself
and each Subsidiary, a system of accounting established and administered in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and furnish to the
Lenders:

         years, an unqualified audit report certified by independent certified
         public accountants, reasonably acceptable to the Lenders, prepared in
         accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles on a consolidated basis
         for itself and the Subsidiaries, including balance sheets as of the end
         of such period, related profit and loss and changes in shareholders'
         equity statements, and a statement of cash flows, accompanied by any
         management letter prepared by said accountants.

                  (ii)     Within 15 days after the close of each month of each
         of its fiscal years, for itself and its Subsidiaries, consolidated
         unaudited balance sheets as at the close of each such period and
         consolidated profit and loss statements (showing a breakout of
         servicing sales gains attributed to servicing originated in prior
         periods), a change in shareholders equity statement for the period from
         the beginning of such fiscal year to the end of such month, all
         certified (subject to normal year-end adjustments) by its chief
         financial officer.

                  (iii)    Together with the financial statements required under
         Sections 6.1(i) and (ii), a compliance certificate in substantially the
         form of Exhibit "F" hereto signed by its chief financial officer
         showing the calculations necessary to determine compliance with this
         Agreement as currently in effect (regardless of whether this Agreement
         was in effect

                                       54

<PAGE>

         at the date for which such financial statements were prepared) and that
         no Default or Unmatured Defaults exists, or if any Default or Unmatured
         Default exists, stating the nature and status thereof.

                  (iv)     As soon as available but in any event within fifteen
         (15) days after the end of each calendar month, a servicing report and
         analysis which shall show the status of all mortgages serviced by the
         Borrower including those which are delinquent, all in such form and
         detail and including such additional information as the Agent may
         reasonably request. Such servicing report shall show separately
         information concerning any mortgages or securities with respect to
         which there is recourse to the Borrower.

                  (v)      As soon as available but in any event within fifteen
         (15) days after the end of each month, a secondary marketing report for

         Agent, copies of all compliance and audit reports received from any of
         FNMA, FHLMC or GNMA; and promptly upon receipt, a copy of any notice
         from (i) any Federal Agency to the effect that it is or is
         contemplating withdrawing its approval of the Borrower as a
         FHA-Approved Mortgagee, FHLMC-Approved Lender, FNMA-Approved Lender or
         VA-Approved Lender or as an approved seller and servicer for FNMA,
         FHLMC or GNMA or (ii) any private mortgage insurer which insures any of
         the Collateral to the effect that it is contemplating withdrawing its
         approval of the Borrower as an approved originator of insured Mortgage
         Loans.

         certified as correct by an actuary enrolled under ERISA.

                  (viii)   As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days
         after the Borrower knows that any Reportable Event has occurred with
         respect to any Plan, a statement, signed by the chief financial officer
         of the Borrower, describing said Reportable Event and the action which
         the Borrower proposes to take with respect thereto.

                  (ix)     As soon as possible and in any event within 10 days
         after receipt by the Borrower, a copy of (a) any notice or claim to the
         effect that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be liable
         to any Person as a result of the release by the Borrower, any of its
         Subsidiaries, or any other Person of any toxic or hazardous waste or
         substance into the environment, and (b) any notice alleging any
         violation of any federal, state or local environmental, health or
         safety law or regulation by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
         which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to have a Material
         Adverse Effect.

                  (x)      Promptly upon the furnishing thereof to the
         shareholders of the Borrower, copies of all financial statements,
         reports and proxy statements so furnished.

                                       55

<PAGE>

                  (xi)     Promptly upon the filing thereof, copies of all
         registration statements and annual, quarterly, monthly or other regular
         reports which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries files with the
         Securities and Exchange Commission.

                  (xii)    Such other information (including non-financial
         information) as the Agent or any Lender may from time to time
         reasonably request.

                  (xiii)   Within fifteen (15) days after the end of each month,
         the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent and the Collateral Agent a
         report (each such report, a "Servicing Rights Certificate") setting
         forth (A) the Servicing Take-Out Value of the Eligible Mortgage
         Servicing Rights as of the end of such month, which amount shall be
         computed in accordance with the values contemplated for such servicing
         under the terms of a valid Approved Servicing Sale Agreement and in
         accordance with FAS 140 with appropriate deductions, if any, necessary
         to account for any capitalized servicing rights which may be shown on
         the Borrower's balance sheet but which do not constitute Eligible
         Mortgage Servicing Rights (whether due to failure to satisfy all of the
         eligibility requirements of the effect of borrowing base sublimits, or
         otherwise), and (B) the amount of the Eligible Servicing Sale
         Receivables as of the end of such month; which report shall be
         presented on a consistent basis and in accordance with GAAP. If title
         to any servicing rights constituting Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights
         is to be transferred by the Borrower and the sum of the resulting
         initial purchase price payment to be made directly to the Cash and
         Collateral Account (if any) and Eligible Servicing Sale Receivable (if
         any) will be less than the Servicing Take-Out Value of the Eligible
         Mortgage Servicing Rights so sold, the Borrower shall deliver a report
         (a "Servicing Transfer Report") to the Agent and the Collateral Agent
         on or prior to the date of transfer of title to the Eligible Mortgage
         Servicing Rights indicating (i) the amount of the resulting reduction
         in the Servicing Take-Out Value, (ii) the amount of the initial
         purchase price payment to be made if such payment is to be made to the
         Cash and Collateral Account, and (iii) the amount of the resulting
         Eligible Servicing Sale Receivable, if any (which report shall be
         certified as to fairness of presentation, Agreement Accounting
         Principles and consistency by the chief financial officer of the
         Borrower). If the Borrower at any time determines that the amount of
         the Take-Out Value of Eligible Mortgage Servicing Rights or the amount
         of Eligible Servicing Sale Receivables is less than the amounts of such
         Collateral that are then included in the calculation of Aggregate
         Servicing Value (e.g. because the Borrower has determined that certain
         Pledged Servicing or Servicing Sale Receivables no longer meet the
         applicable eligibility criteria), then the Borrower shall immediately
         notify the Agent and the Collateral Agent of the applicable change (a
         "Reduced Servicing Notice").

         6.2      Use of Proceeds. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, only use the proceeds of the Advances for the purposes described
in the recitals hereto, to pay interest, Fees, expenses and other Obligations,
to pay Indebtedness of the Borrower existing on the date hereof and to repay
outstanding Advances. The Borrower will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary
to, use any of the proceeds of the Advances to purchase or carry any "margin
stock" (as defined in Regulation U) or to make any Acquisition (other than those
permitted by Section 6.14) or to make any Acquisition for which the board of
directors of the Person being acquired has not consented to such Acquisition.

                                       56

<PAGE>

         6.3      Notice of Default. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, give prompt notice in writing to the Lenders of the occurrence of
any Default or Unmatured Default and of any other development, financial or
otherwise, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         6.4      Conduct of Business. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, carry on and conduct its business in substantially the same
manner and in substantially the same fields of enterprise as it is presently
conducted. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary which is a material
part of the Borrower's overall business operations to, do all things necessary
to remain duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and (to the extent
such concept applies to such entity) in good standing as a domestic corporation,
partnership or limited liability company in its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, and maintain all requisite authority to
conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which its business is conducted.
The Borrower will use best efforts to adhere in all material respects to
customary practices and standards in the industry insofar as adherence to such
practices and standards would require the Borrower to cause obligors whose
indebtedness is secured by Pledged Mortgages to comply with their obligations
under such Pledged Mortgages with respect to the real estate securing such
indebtedness, including without limitation, the payment of all taxes and
insurance premiums related thereto and maintenance of such real estate in
compliance with all laws.

         6.5      Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary to,
timely file complete and correct United States federal and applicable foreign,
state and local tax returns required by law and pay when due all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges and levies upon it or its income, profits
or Property, except those which are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves have been set aside in
accordance with Agreement Accounting Principles. At any time that the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries is organized as a limited liability company, each
such limited liability company will qualify for disregarded entity tax treatment
under United States federal tax law.

         6.6      Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each Subsidiary
to, maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance
on all their Property in such amounts and covering such risks as is consistent
with sound business practice, and the Borrower will furnish to any Lender upon
request full information as to the insurance carried. The Borrower will at all
times, upon request of the Agent, furnish to the Agent copies of its, and each
of its Subsidiaries', current Mortgage Bankers Blanket Bond and of its, and each
of its Subsidiaries', insurance policy containing errors and omissions coverage
or mortgage impairment coverage, and such Bonds and policies, to the extent
possible, shall each provide that it is not cancelable without thirty (30) days
prior written notice to the Agent.

         6.7      Compliance with Laws. The Borrower will, and will cause each
Subsidiary to, comply with all laws, rules, regulations, orders, writs,
judgments, injunctions, decrees or awards to which it may be subject, including,
without limitation, all Environmental Laws, non-compliance with which could,
singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the business or financial condition of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, unless the same shall be contested by the
Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in good faith and by
appropriate proceedings and such contest shall operate to stay the material
adverse effect of any such non-compliance.

                                       57

<PAGE>

         6.8      Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower will, and will cause
each Subsidiary to, do all things necessary to maintain, preserve, protect and
keep its Property in good repair, working order and condition, and make all
necessary and proper repairs, renewals and replacements so that its business
carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times.

         6.9      Inspection. Upon reasonable prior notice, the Borrower will,
and will cause each Subsidiary to, permit the Agent, the Collateral Agent and
the Lenders, by their respective representatives and agents, to inspect any of
the Property, books and financial records of the Borrower and each Subsidiary,
to examine and make copies of the books of accounts and other financial records
of the Borrower and each Subsidiary, and to discuss the affairs, finances and

         7.17     The representations and warranties set forth in "Section 5.15
Plan Assets; Prohibited Transactions" shall at any time not be true and correct.

         7.18     Any of this Agreement, the Notes or the Security Agreement
shall, at any time after its execution and delivery, for any reason cease to be
in full force and effect (unless such occurrence is in accordance with its terms
or after payment thereof) or shall be declared to be null and void, or the
validity or enforceability thereof shall be contested by the Borrower, or the
Borrower shall deny that it has any further liability or obligation thereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                   COLLATERAL, ACCELERATION AND OTHER REMEDIES

         8.1      Security and Collateral Agency Agreement. Pursuant to the
Security Agreement, a security interest in and a continuing lien upon the
Collateral has been created in favor of the Collateral Agent for the benefit of
the Lenders.

         8.2      AP Mortgages. The Borrower agrees that while it is in
possession of any Required Mortgage Documents for an AP Mortgage, it will hold
same in trust and as agent and bailee for the Collateral Agent, without
authority to make any other disposition thereof, or of the proceeds thereof,
except as may be otherwise permitted in writing by the Collateral Agent. The
Borrower assumes the responsibility for loss or destruction of any such Required
Mortgage Documents until the same are delivered to the Collateral Agent.

         8.3      Release of Collateral. Upon the request of the Borrower
delivered from time to time to the Agent and the Collateral Agent in connection
with the proposed sale of any Collateral, the Agent shall authorize the
Collateral Agent to release Collateral specified in such notice from the lien of
this Agreement, if, but only if, (i) at the time of such release no Default
shall have occurred and then be continuing, (ii) the Borrowing Base, after
giving effect to such release, is at least equal to the aggregate principal
amount of loans outstanding under this Agreement or any payment under Section
2.11 which may be required as a result of such release has been made and (iii)
the release of such Collateral will not create a violation of any Lending
Sublimit or Borrowing Base Sublimit.

         8.4      Cash and Collaeral Account; Settlement Account; Reconciliation
Process; and Funding Account.

                  (i)      The Collateral Agent has established in its name, as
         collateral agent, a "cash and collateral" account with Bank One, NA
         (the "Cash and Collateral Account")

                                       66

<PAGE>

         into which shall be deposited all cash proceeds from the sale of any
         Pledged Item, all as described in the Collection and Paying Agreement.

                  (ii)     There is hereby established with the Agent, for the
         benefit of the Secured Parties, a separate "cash collateral" account of
         the Borrower, Account #1073857 ("Settlement Account") into which shall,
         in certain circumstances, be deposited certain cash proceeds from the
         Cash and Collateral Account as described herein and in the Collection
         and Paying Agreement. The Settlement Account shall be included in the
         Collateral and the Borrower hereby pledges and assigns to the Agent for
         the benefit of the Secured Parties and grants to the Agent for the
         benefit of the Secured Parties, a first priority security interest in
         the Settlement Account to secure payment of the Secured Obligations.
         Only the Agent shall have access to the Settlement Account.

                  (iii)    No later than 3:30 p.m. (Chicago time) each Business
         Day the Borrower shall arrange for the Collateral Agent to notify the
         Borrower and the Agent of the amount of Reconciled Non-Security
         Proceeds deposited into the Cash and Collateral Account since the
         report of Reconciled Non-Security Proceeds on the prior Business Day,
         and (so long as no Event of Default is continuing and the Borrowing
         Base is equal to or greater than the total outstanding Loans) the
         Collateral Agent shall transfer such newly deposited Reconciled
         Non-Security Proceeds into the Borrower's operating account or apply
         them as otherwise directed by the Borrower. Any Excess Pool Proceeds
         shall (so long as no Default is continuing and the Borrowing Base is
         equal to or greater than the total outstanding Loans) also be
         transferred into the Borrower's operating account or applied as
         otherwise directed by the Borrower. If the Borrowing Base is not equal
         to or greater than the total outstanding Loans, then the Collateral
         Agent shall transfer the necessary amount of the Reconciled
         Non-Security Proceeds and/or Excess Pool Proceeds to the Agent for
         application against the outstanding Loans so that the Borrowing Base
         equals the total outstanding Loans. Such application shall be made
         first to repay any outstanding Overadvances (as defined in Paragraph
         6(d) of the Security Agreement) and then to repay then outstanding
         Loans in the order and in the amounts directed by the Borrower or, in
         the absence of such direction, in the following order: (i) first, to
         Swingline Loans until paid in full, (ii) second, to Fed Funds Loans
         until paid in full, (iii) third, to Eurodollar Loans (and with respect
         to Eurodollar Loans only, to interest thereon) until paid in full, and
         (iv) fourth, to Bid Loans until paid in full. With respect to
         Eurodollar Loans, such amounts (1) shall be applied to such Loans in
         the order in which their Interest Periods expire (i.e. the Eurodollar
         Loans first maturing shall be the first repaid), and (2) shall be
         applied to interest on Loans which have been repaid before being
         applied to principal of Loans having a different Interest Period.

                  (iv)     Upon the occurrence of a Default (and during the
         continuance thereof) all amounts then on deposit in the Cash and
         Collateral Account which constitute Collateral or the proceeds thereof,
         and any deposits made in the Cash and Collateral Account which
         constitute Collateral or the proceeds thereof during the continuance of
         such Default, shall be immediately transferred by the Collateral Agent
         to the Settlement Account and shall thereupon, together with any other
         amounts then or thereafter in the Settlement Account, be withdrawn by
         the Agent from the Settlement Account and applied to outstanding Loans
         in proportion to the Lenders' respective outstanding Loans and (with
         respect to the

                                       67

<PAGE>

         Lenders) in conjunction with the procedures described in Section 2.6,
         with such payments applied first to accrued interest and fees and
         thereafter to principal.

                  (v)      There has also been established with the Agent, for
         the benefit of the Lenders, another account of the Borrower, Account
         #55-34658 ("Funding Account"), from which all AP Mortgages shall be
         funded (either by check drawn on such Funding Account or by wire
         transfer from such Funding Account).

         8.5      Termination. If all Commitments under this Agreement shall
have expired or been terminated pursuant to the express terms hereof and no
Obligations shall be outstanding, the Agent shall promptly deliver or cause to
be delivered all cash standing to the credit of the Settlement Account and
Pledged Items to the Borrower. The receipt by the Borrower of any cash in the
Settlement Account and of all Pledged Items returned or delivered to the
Borrower pursuant to any provision of this Agreement, together with UCC-3
termination statements executed by the Agent, shall be a complete and full
acquittance for the Pledged Items so delivered.

         8.6      Acceleration. If any Default described in Section 7.6 or 7.7
occurs with respect to the Borrower, the obligations of the Lenders to make
Loans hereunder shall automatically terminate and the Obligations shall
immediately become due and payable without any election or action on the part of
the Agent or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or
the Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may (i) terminate or suspend
the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder and they shall, upon
notice to the Borrower, terminate or be suspended, and/or (ii) declare the
Obligations to be due and payable, whereupon the Obligations shall become
immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind, all of which the Borrower hereby expressly waives.

         8.7      Other Remedies.

                  (i)      Unless a Default shall have occurred and then be
         continuing, the Borrower shall be entitled to receive and collect
         directly all sums payable to the Borrower in respect of the Collateral
         except proceeds from the sale thereof.

                  (ii)     Upon the occurrence of a Default, the Agent and the
         Collateral Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, shall be entitled to all
         the rights and remedies hereunder and in the Security Agreement,
         subject to the limitations and requirements of Paragraph 16 thereof,
         and all other rights or remedies at law or in equity existing or
         conferred upon the Lenders by other jurisdictions or other applicable
         law.

                  (iii)    Following the occurrence and during the continuance
         of a Default, no Lender shall be obligated to fund any Loan hereunder.

                  (iv)     Following the occurrence a Default, the Borrower
         agrees that the Borrower and the Agent shall, if the Agent shall
         request implement certain procedures with respect to the Borrower's
         funding of AP Mortgages, all at the Borrower's sole expense. Such
         procedures may include, but are not limited to: (i) reducing the
         advance rate against any Eligible Collateral for purposes of
         determining the Collateral Value component of the Borrowing Base, (ii)
         requiring that if AP Mortgages are funded with

                                       68

<PAGE>

         wire transfers, such wire transfers originate from the Funding Account
         and may only be released upon the secondary authorization of the Agent,
         (iii) requiring the closing agents for such AP Mortgages to enter into
         escrow or other agreements regarding the monies used to fund such AP
         Mortgages, and (iv) requiring the Borrower to provide the Agent and the
         Lenders with such information regarding the funding of such AP
         Mortgages as the Agent may reasonably request. The Borrower, at its
         expense, shall from time to time execute and deliver to the Agent or
         the Collateral Agent all such assignments, certificates, supplemental
         documents, and financing statements, and shall do all other acts or
         things, as the Agent may reasonably request in order to more fully
         implement such procedures.

                  (v)      The Borrower waives, to the extent permitted by law,
         any right to require the Agent or any Lender to (i) proceed against any
         Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any of the Collateral or pursue
         its rights and remedies as against the Collateral in any particular
         order or (iii) pursue any other remedy in its power.

                  (vi)     The Agent on behalf of the Lenders may, but shall not
         be obligated to, advance any sums or do any act or thing necessary to
         uphold and enforce the lien and priority of, or the security intended
         to be afforded by, any Pledged Item, including, without limitation,
         payment of delinquent taxes or assessments and insurance premiums. The
         Borrower shall provide any and all information required by the Agent to
         administer this Agreement or collect on the Collateral. All advances,
         charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
         incurred or paid by the Agent in exercising any right, power or remedy
         conferred by this Agreement, or in the enforcement hereof (or by any
         Lender acting on instruction of the Required Lenders in the enforcement
         hereof), together with interest thereon at the rate per annum of 2%
         plus the Alternate Base Rate from the time of payment until repaid,
         shall become a part of the Obligations.

                  (vii)    Following the occurrence of a Default and the
         acceleration of the Obligations the Agent shall be entitled to receive
         and collect all sums payable to the Borrower in respect of the
         Collateral and (a) the Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders,
         may in its own name or in the name of the Borrower or otherwise,
         demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at any time
         payable or receivable on account of or in exchange for any of the
         Collateral, (b) the Borrower shall receive and hold in trust for the
         Lenders any amounts thereafter received by the Borrower upon or in
         respect of any of the Collateral, advising the Agent as to the source
         of such funds and, if the Agent so requests at the direction of the
         Required Lenders, forthwith paying such amounts to the Agent, and (c)
         any and all amounts so received and collected by the Agent either
         directly or from the Borrower shall be deposited in the Settlement
         Account.

         8.8      Application of Proceeds. After a Default and acceleration of
the Obligations, the proceeds of any sale or enforcement of all or any part of
the Collateral pursuant to the Security Agreement and the balance of any moneys
in the Settlement Account and the Funding Account shall be applied by the Agent:

                  FIRST, to the extent that any such proceeds arise from a sale
         of any Pledged Servicing, to the payment of any amounts due by the
         Borrower to the other party to the

                                       69

<PAGE>

         Servicing Agreements governing such Pledged Servicing, as a condition
         to the transfer of the Borrower's interest in any such Pledged
         Servicing, pursuant to the terms of such Servicing Agreements,
         including without limitation all amounts described in the
         Acknowledgement Agreements;

                  SECOND, to the extent not already repaid from the proceeds of
         the Collateral by the Collateral Agent, to the payment of all costs and
         expenses of such sale or enforcement, including reasonable compensation
         to the Agent's agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and
         advances made or incurred by the Agent or any Lender acting on
         instructions of the Required Lenders in connection therewith;

                  THIRD, to the extent not already repaid from the proceeds of
         the Collateral by the Collateral Agent, to the payment of all costs and
         expenses incurred by the Collateral Agent under the Security Agreement;

                  FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal balance
         of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on and Fees attributable to,
         all Loans under this Agreement, ratably according to the amount so due
         to each Lender until such amounts are paid in full;

                  FIFTH, to the extent proceeds remain after application under
         the preceding subparagraphs, to the payment of all remaining
         Obligations, until such amounts are paid in full;

                  SIXTH, to the extent that any such proceeds arise from a sale
         of any Pledged Servicing and remain after satisfying the prior amounts
         in full, to the payment of all sums due to any party to the Servicing
         Agreement governing such Pledged Servicing which, by the terms of the
         applicable Acknowledgment Agreement, are subordinated in priority of
         payment to the amounts payable to the Agent and the Lenders, as
         described above; and

                  SEVENTH, to the payment to the Borrower, or to its successors
         or assigns, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any
         surplus then remaining from such proceeds.

         The Agent shall have absolute discretion as to the time of application
of any such proceeds, moneys or balances in accordance with this Agreement. If
the proceeds of any such sale are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses
of such sale, as aforesaid, and the payment in full of the Obligations, the
Borrower shall remain liable for any deficiency.

         8.9      Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or
the Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair such right
or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence therein, and
the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or the inability
of the Borrower to satisfy the conditions precedent to such Loan shall not
constitute any waiver or acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any
such right shall not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless
in writing signed by the Lenders required pursuant to Section 9.1, and then only
to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies

                                       70

<PAGE>

contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all
shall be available to the Agent and the Lenders until the Obligations have been
paid in full.

         8.10     Actions Under Acknowledgement Agreements. If the Borrower
elects to include Pledged Servicing in Collateral, the Borrower shall be deemed
to have appointed the Agent as the Borrower's attorney-in-fact, effective as of
the date of any Default (and during the continuance thereof) for the purpose of
taking all actions on behalf of the Borrower contemplated or required under the
terms of the Acknowledgement Agreements with respect to such Pledged Servicing
and executing any instruments which the Agent may deem necessary or advisable to
accomplish the purposes hereof, which appointment as attorney-in-fact is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Agent shall have the right and power to receive, endorse and
collect all checks made payable to the order of the Borrower representing any
payment on account of the principal of or interest on any of the Mortgage Loans
covered by such Pledged Servicing or on account of the terms of the Servicing
Agreements governing such Pledged Servicing and to give full discharge for the
same.

         8.11     Transition from Prior Facilities. The Pledge Date and all
other relevant delivery dates and time periods with respect to the determination
of Eligible Collateral shall be calculated to include any delivery dates or
holding periods prior to the Effective Date during which Collateral was being
held by the Collateral Agent (or was the subject of an Agreement to Pledge), had
been delivered to an Approved Investor or had been redelivered to the Borrower
under the Prior Facilities.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                     AMENDMENTS; WAIVERS; GENERAL PROVISIONS

         9.1      Amendments and Waivers. Other than (a) Commitment increases
pursuant to Section 2.10 (which may be accomplished solely by the Borrower, the
Agent and the subject Lender) and (b) temporary waivers of Collateral
eligibility permitted pursuant to the definition of "Borrowing Base" (which may
be accomplished solely by the Agent), the Required Lenders (or the Agent with
the consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower may enter into
agreements supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any
provisions to the Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the
Lenders or the Borrower hereunder or waiving any Default hereunder; provided,
however, that no such supplemental agreement shall, without the consent of each
Lender directly or indirectly affected thereby:

                  (i)      Extend the final maturity of any Loan or postpone any
                           regularly scheduled payment of principal of any Loan
                           or forgive all or any portion of the principal amount
                           thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of
                           payment of, or forgive, interest or fees thereon.

                  (ii)     Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of
                           Required Lenders.

                  (iii)    Extend the Termination Date, or reduce the amount of
                           or extend the payment date for the mandatory payments
                           required under Section 2.11, or increase the amount
                           of the Aggregate Commitment or of the Commitment of
                           any Lender hereunder (other than in accordance with
                           Section 2.10).

                                       71

<PAGE>

                  (iv)     Amend this Section 9.1.

                  (v)      Release any guarantor of any Advance or, except as
                           provided herein or in the Security Agreement, release
                           any Collateral.

                  (vi)     Amend the definition of "Borrowing Base," "Gestation
                           Borrowing Base," "Warehouse Borrowing Base," or

                  (vii)    Permit the Borrower to assign its rights under this
                           Agreement or amend or waive any restriction on the
                           Borrower's ability to assign its rights or
                           obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

                  (viii)   Amend or waive any Lending Sublimits or Borrowing
                           Base Sublimits.

                  (ix)     Amend or waive any provision herein regarding the
                           indemnification of the Agent, the Collateral Agent or
                           any Lender.

                  (x)      Amend or waive any provision herein regarding the
                           allocation among the Lenders of any payments or
                           proceeds received by the Agent hereunder.

No amendment of any provision of this Agreement relating to the Agent or the
Collateral Agent shall be effective without the written consent of the Agent or
the Collateral Agent, as the case may be. In addition, the consent of the
Collateral Agent shall be required for the effectiveness of any amendment
referred to in Section 9.1 (iv), (v), (vi), (viii) and/or (ix) above. The Agent
may waive payment of the fee required under Section 12.3.2 without obtaining the
consent of any other party to this Agreement.

         9.2      Survival of Representations. All representations and
warranties of the Borrower contained in this Agreement shall survive the making
of the Loans herein contemplated.

         9.3      Governmental Regulation. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, no Lender shall be obligated to extend credit
to the Borrower in violation of any limitation or prohibition provided by any
applicable statute or regulation.

         9.4      Headings. Section headings in the Loan Documents are for
convenience of reference only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of
the provisions of the Loan Documents.

         9.5      Entire Agreement. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral Agent
and the Lenders and supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders relating to the subject matter thereof,
other than the fee letter described in Section 2.7.4 and any other agreement
entered into in connection with the fees described in Section 2.7.5.

         9.6      Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The
respective obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no
Lender shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which
the Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to perform
any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from any of

                                       72

<PAGE>

its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall not be construed so as to confer
any right or benefit upon any Person other than the parties to this Agreement
and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that the parties
hereto expressly, agree that (i) the Arranger shall enjoy the benefits of the
provisions of Sections 9.7, 9.8 and 10.11 to the extent specifically set forth
therein and shall have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf
and in its own name to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement
and (ii) the Collateral Agent shall enjoy the benefits of the provisions of
Sections 9.1, 9.7 and 9.8 to the extent specifically set forth therein and shall
have the right to enforce such provisions on its own behalf and in its own name
to the same extent as if it were a party to this Agreement.

         9.7      Expenses; Indemnification. (i) The Borrower shall reimburse
the Agent, the Arranger and the Collateral Agent for any reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and time charges of
attorneys for the Agent, the Arranger and the Collateral Agent) paid or incurred
by the Agent, the Arranger or the Collateral Agent in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery, syndication, review, amendment,
modification, and administration of the Loan Documents. The Borrower also agrees
to reimburse the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders for
any out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys' fees and time charges of
attorneys for the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders)
paid or incurred by the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent or any Lender
in connection with the collection and enforcement of the Loan Documents.
Expenses being reimbursed by the Borrower under this Section include, without
limitation, reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
reports described in the following two sentences. The Borrower acknowledges that
Bank One may prepare and distribute to the Lenders annual audit reports (and
shall distribute copies to each Lender that requests a copy in writing of any
such report actually prepared by Bank One) pertaining to the Borrower's assets
for internal use by Bank One from information furnished to it by or on behalf of
the Borrower, after Bank One has exercised its rights of inspection pursuant to
this Agreement. The Borrower acknowledges that Bank One may, in certain
extraordinary circumstances, prepare and distribute other audit reports to the
Lenders (and shall distribute copies to each Lender that requests a copy in
writing of any report actually prepared by Bank One) pertaining to the
Borrower's assets for internal use by Bank One from information furnished to it
by or on behalf of the Borrower, after Bank One has exercised its rights of
inspection pursuant to this Agreement. The Borrower acknowledges that the
foregoing two sentences shall not limit Bank One's right to prepare additional
audit reports at its own expense from time to time.

                  (ii)     The Borrower hereby further agrees to indemnify the
Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent and each Lender, their respective
affiliates, and each of their directors, officers and employees against all
losses, claims, damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, all expenses of litigation or preparation
therefor whether or not the Agent, the Arranger, the Collateral Agent, any
Lender or any affiliate is a party thereto) which any of them may pay or incur
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
transactions contemplated hereby or the direct or indirect application or
proposed application of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder except to the extent
that they have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
party seeking indemnification. The obligations of the Borrower under this
Section 9.7 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

         9.8      Nonliability of Lenders. The relationship between the Borrower
on the one hand and the Lenders, the Agent and the Collateral Agent on the other
hand shall be solely that of borrower and lender. Neither the Agent, the
Arranger, the Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall have any fiduciary

by the Borrower in connection with, arising out of, or in any way related to,
the transactions contemplated and the relationship established by the Loan
Documents, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith,
unless such losses resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the party from which recovery is sought. Neither the Agent, the Arranger, the
Collateral Agent nor any Lender shall have any liability with respect to, and
the Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue for, any special,
indirect or consequential damages suffered by the Borrower in connection with,
arising out of, or in any way related to the Loan Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby.

         9.9      Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document
that is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction
shall, as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid
without affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the
operation, enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other
jurisdiction, and to this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared
to be severable.

         9.10     Numbers of Documents. All statements, notices, closing
documents, and requests hereunder shall be furnished to the Agent with
sufficient counterparts so that the Agent may furnish one to each of the

Affiliate to the Borrower or any Lender, respectively, arising out of or
resulting from such investments, loans or relationships other than liabilities

Affiliates.

Documents. In its capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Agent
(i) does not hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a
"representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of the term "secured party"
as defined in the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to
time and (iii) is acting as an independent contractor, the rights and duties of

Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby agrees to assert no claim against the
Agent on any agency theory or any other theory of liability for breach of
fiduciary duty, all of which claims each Lender hereby waives.

         10.2     Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers
under the Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms
of each thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

         10.3     General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,

inaction arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

or agreements of any obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (iii) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article IV, except
receipt of items required to be delivered solely to the Agent; (iv) the

collateral security; or (vii) the financial condition of the Borrower or any
guarantor of any of the Obligations or of any of the Borrower's or any such
guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The Agent shall have no duty to disclose to
the Lenders information that is not required to be furnished by the Borrower to
the Agent at such time, but is voluntarily furnished by the Borrower to the
Agent (either in its capacity as Agent or in its individual capacity).

         10.5     Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and
under any other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by
the Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to
act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

         10.6     Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of
its duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

         10.7     Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to

legal matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel
may be employees of the Agent.

         10.8     Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree
to reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrower for which the Agent is

                                       76
<PAGE>

entitled to reimbursement by the Borrower under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any
other expenses incurred by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection
with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the
Agent in connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between
two or more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, provided that (i) no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing
to the extent any of the foregoing is found in, a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the Agent and (ii) any indemnification required
pursuant to Section 3.5(vii) shall, notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 10.8, be paid by the relevant Lender in accordance with the provisions
thereof The obligations of the Lenders under this Section 10.8 shall survive
payment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         10.9     Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Unmatured Default
hereunder unless the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the
Borrower referring to this Agreement describing such Default or Unmatured
Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that
the Agent receives such a notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to
the Lenders.

         10.10    Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the
Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which the Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person. The Agent, in its
individual capacity, is not obligated to be or remain a Lender.

         10.11    Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrower and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         10.12    Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, ninety days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have
the right to appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a successor
Agent; provided, however, that such appointment, unless made during the
continuance of an Unmatured Default, shall be subject to the consent of the
Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If no successor
Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days
after the resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the
resigning Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrower and the Lenders, a
successor Agent; provided, however, that such appointment, unless made during
the continuance of an Unmatured Default, shall be subject to the consent of the
Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without the consent of the Borrower
or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which is a commercial bank as a
successor Agent hereunder. If the Agent has resigned and no successor Agent has
been appointed, the Lenders may perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder
and the Borrower shall make all payments in respect of the Obligations to the
applicable Lender and for all other purposes shall deal directly with the
Lenders. No successor Agent shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such
successor Agent has accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be
a commercial bank having capital and retained earnings of at least $500,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent,
such successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning Agent. Upon the
effectiveness of the resignation of the Agent, the resigning Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the Loan
Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation of an Agent, the
provisions of this Article X shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event
that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its
duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 10.12, then the
term "`Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the prime rate, base
rate or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

         10.13    Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrower and the Lenders agree
that the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under Articles IX and X.

         10.14    Collateral Releases. The Lenders hereby empower and authorize
the Agent to execute and deliver to the Borrower on their behalf any agreements,
documents or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect any
releases of Collateral which shall be permitted by the terms hereof or of any
other Loan Document or which shall otherwise have been approved by the Required
Lenders (or, if required by the terms of Section 9.1, all of the Lenders) in
writing.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                            SETOFF; RATABLE PAYMENTS

         11.1     Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights
of the Lenders under applicable law, if the Borrower becomes insolvent, however
evidenced, or any Default occurs, any and all deposits (including all account
balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not collected or
available), any amounts owed under Rate Management Transactions, and any other
Indebtedness at any time held or owing by any Lender or any Affiliate of any
Lender to or for the credit or account of the Borrower may be offset and applied
toward the payment of the Obligations owing to such Lender, whether or not the
Obligations, or any part hereof, shall then be due.

         11.2     Ratable Payments. If any Lender, whether by setoff or
otherwise, has payment made to it upon its Loans (other than payments received
pursuant to Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 or 3.5) in a greater proportion than that
received by any other Lender, such Lender agrees, promptly upon demand, to
purchase a portion of the Loans held by the other Lenders so that after such
purchase each Lender will hold its ratable proportion of Loans. If any Lender,
whether in connection with setoff or amounts which might be subject to setoff or
otherwise, receives collateral or other protection for its Obligations or such
amounts which may be subject to setoff, such Lender agrees, promptly upon
demand, to take such action necessary such that all Lenders share in the
benefits of such collateral ratably in proportion to their Loans. In case any
such payment is disturbed by legal process, or otherwise, appropriate further
adjustments shall be made.

         11.3     Custodial Accounts. The Borrower agrees that funds received
and held by the Borrower as custodian for FNMA, GNMA or other mortgage pools
which are deposited into accounts with any Lender shall be clearly identified as
custodial accounts, and each Lender agrees that each provision of the foregoing
subsections of this Article XI shall not apply to such custodial accounts. The
Borrower shall not deposit any of its general funds in any custodial accounts or
otherwise commingle funds in any custodial accounts.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS; COMMITMENT INCREASES

         12.1     Successors and Assigns. The terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the
Lenders and their respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the
Borrower shall not have the right to assign its rights or obligations under the
Loan Documents and (ii) and assignment by any Lender must be made in compliance
with Section 12.3. The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that clause (ii) of
this Section 12.1 relates only to absolute assignments and does not prohibit
assignments creating security interests, including, without limitation, any
pledge or assignment by any Lender of all or any portion of its rights under
this Agreement and any Note to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided, however, that
no such pledge or assignment creating a security interest shall release the
transferor Lender from its obligations hereunder unless and until the parties
hereto have complied with the provisions of Section 12.3. The Agent may treat
the Person which made any Loan or which holds any Note as the owner thereof for
all purposes hereof unless and until such Person complies with Section 12.3,
provided, however, that the Agent may in its discretion (but

                                       79
<PAGE>

shall not be required to) follow instructions from the Person which made any
Loan or which holds any Note to direct payments relating to such Loan or Note to
another Person. Any assignee of the rights to any Loans or any Note agrees by
acceptance of such transfer or assignment to be bound by all the terms and
provisions of the Loan Documents. Any request, authority or consent of any
Person, who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or
consent is the owner of the Rights to any Loan (whether or not a Note has been
issued in evidence thereof), shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent
holder, or assignee of the rights to such Loan.

         12.2     Participations.

                  12.2.1   Permitted Participants; Effect. Any Lender may, in
the ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at
any time sell to one or more banks or other entities ("Participants")
participating interests in any Loan owing to such Lender, any Note held by such
Lender, any Commitment of such Lender or any other interest of such Lender under
the Loan Documents. In the event of any such sale by a Lender of participating
interests to a Participant, such Lender's obligations under the Loan Documents
shall remain unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, such Lender shall remain
the owner of its Loans and the holder of any Note issued to it in evidence
thereof for all purposes under the Loan Documents, all amounts payable by the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be determined as if such Lender had not sold
such participating interests, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  12.2.2   Voting Rights. Each Lender shall retain the sole
right to approve, without the consent of any Participant, any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents other than any
amendment, modification or waiver with respect to any Loan or Commitment in
which such Participant has an interest which forgives principal, interest or
fees or reduces the interest rate or fees payable with respect to any such Loan
or Commitment, extends the Termination Date, postpones any date fixed for any
regularly-scheduled payment of principal of, or interest or fees on, any such
Loan or Commitment, releases any guarantor of any such Loan or releases all or
substantially all of the Collateral (other than as expressly permitted pursuant
to the Loan Documents).

                  12.2.3   Benefit of Setoff. The Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be deemed to have the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1
in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under the Loan
Documents to the same extent as if the amount of its participating interest were
owing directly to it as a Lender under the Loan Documents, provided that each
Lender shall retain the right of setoff provided in Section 11.1 with respect to
the amount of participating interests sold to each Participant. The Lenders
agree to share with each Participant, and each Participant, by exercising the
right of setoff provided in Section 11.1, agrees to share with each Lender, any
amount received pursuant to the exercise of its right of setoff, such amounts to
be shared in accordance with Section 11.2 as if each Participant were a Lender.

         12.3     Assignments.

                                       80
<PAGE>

                  12.3.1   Permitted Assignments. Any Lender may, in the
ordinary course of its business and in accordance with applicable law, at any
time assign to one or more banks or other entities ("Purchasers") all or any
part of its rights and obligations under the Loan Documents. Such assignment
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit "J' hereto or in such other form
as may be agreed to by the parties thereto. The consent of the Borrower and the
Agent shall be required prior to an assignment becoming effective with respect
to a Purchaser which is not a Lender or an Affiliate thereof, provided, however,
that if a Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of the Borrower
shall not be required. Such consents of the Agent and the Borrower shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each such assignment shall (unless it is to a
Lender or an Affiliate thereof or each of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise
consents) be in an amount not less than the lesser of (i) $10,000,000 or (ii)
the remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment (calculated as at the
date of such assignment).

                  12.3.2   Effect; Effective Date. Upon (i) delivery to the
Agent of a notice of assignment, substantially in the form attached as Annex "I"
to Exhibit "J' hereto (a "Notice of Assignment"), together with any consents
required by Section 12.3.1, and (ii) payment of a $3,500 fee to the Agent for
processing such assignment, such assignment shall become effective on the
effective date specified in such Notice of Assignment. The Notice of Assignment
shall contain a representation by the Purchaser to the effect that none of the
consideration used to make the purchase of the Commitment and Loans under the
applicable assignment agreement are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and
that the rights and interests of the Purchaser in and under the Loan Documents
will not be "plan assets" under ERISA. On and after the effective date of such
assignment, such Purchaser shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this
Agreement and any other Loan Document executed by or on behalf of the Lenders
and shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under the Loan
Documents, to the same extent as if it were an original party hereto, and no
further consent or action by the Borrower, the Lenders or the Agent shall be
required to release the transferor Lender with respect to the percentage of the
Aggregate Commitment and Loans assigned to such Purchaser. Upon the consummation
of any assignment to a Purchaser pursuant to this Section 12.3.2, the transferor
Lender, the Agent and the Borrower shall, if the transferor Lender or the
Purchaser desires that its Loans be evidenced by Notes, make appropriate
arrangements so that new Notes or, as appropriate replacement Notes are issued
to such transferor Lender and new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement Notes,
are issued to such Purchaser, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their
respective Commitments, as adjusted pursuant to such assignment. In addition,
within a reasonable time after the effective date of any assignment, the Agent
shall, and is hereby authorized and directed to, revise Schedule "1' reflecting
the revised commitments and percentages of each of the Lenders and shall
distribute such revised Schedule "1' to each of the Lenders and the Borrower,
whereupon such revised Schedule shall replace the old Schedule and become part
of this Agreement.

         12.4     INTENTIONALLY OMITTED

         12.5     Dissemination of Information. The Borrower authorizes each
Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchaser or any other Person acquiring
an interest in the Loan Documents by operation of law (each a "Transferee") and
any prospective Transferee any and all information in such Lender's possession
concerning the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, including
without limitation any information contained in any Reports; provided

                                       81
<PAGE>

that each Transferee and prospective Transferee agrees to be bound by Section
9.12 of this Agreement.

         12.6     Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is
transferred to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor
Lender shall cause such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such
transfer, to comply with the provisions of Section 3.5(iv).

                                  ARTICLE XIII

respect to borrowing notices, all notices, requests and other communications to

case of the Borrower, the Agent or any Lender, at its address or facsimile
number set forth on the signature pages hereof, (y) in the case of the
Collateral Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the signature
pages of the Security Agreement or (z) in the case of any party, at such other

by notice to the Agent and the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 13.1. Each such notice, request or other communication shall be
effective (i) if given by facsimile transmission., when transmitted to the
facsimile number specified in this Section and confirmation of receipt is
received, (ii) if given by mail, 72 hours after such communication is deposited
in the mails with first class postage prepaid, addressed as aforesaid or (iii)
if given by any other means, when delivered at the address specified in this
Section; provided that notices to the Agent under Article 11 shall not be
effective until received.

         13.2     Change of Address. The Borrower, the Agent, the Collateral
Agent and any Lender may each change the address for service of notice upon it
by a notice in writing to the other parties hereto.

                                  ARTICLE XIV
                                  COUNTERPARTS

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, all of
which taken together shall constitute one agreement, and any of the parties
hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such counterpart. This
Agreement shall be effective when it has been executed by the Borrower, the
Agent and the Lenders and each party has notified the Agent by facsimile
transmission or telephone, that it has taken such action.

                                   ARTICLE XV
          CHOICE OF LAW, CONSENT TO JURISDICTION, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

         15.1     CHOICE OF LAW. THE LOAN DOCUMENTS (OTHER THAN THOSE CONTAINING
A CONTRARY EXPRESS CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION) SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS (AND NOT THE LAW OF CONFLICTS) OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS,
BUT GIVING EFFECT TO FEDERAL LAWS APPLICABLE TO NATIONAL BANKS.

         15.2     CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY UNITED STATES FEDERAL OR
ILLINOIS STATE COURT SITTING IN CHICAGO IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AGREES
THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND
DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION IT MAY NOW OR
HEREAFTER HAVE AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN
SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL
LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE
BORROWER IN THE COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BY THE
BORROWER AGAINST THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE AGENT OR ANY
LENDER INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATED TO, OR CONNECTED WITH ANY LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN A COURT
IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS.

RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED THEREUNDER.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Agent have
executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.

                              ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

         This Assignment Agreement (this "Assignment Agreement") between
___________ (the "Assignor") and ____________ (the "Assignee") is dated as of
___________, 200_. The parties hereto agree as follows:

         1.       PRELIMINARY STATEMENT. The Assignor is a party to a Credit
Agreement (which, as it may be amended, modified, renewed or extended from time
to time is herein called the "Credit Agreement") described in Item 1 of Schedule
1 attached hereto ("Schedule 1). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Credit
Agreement.

         2.       ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION. The Assignor hereby sells and
assigns to the Assignee, and the Assignee hereby purchases and assumes from the
Assignor, an interest in and to the Assignor's rights and obligations under the
Credit Agreement such that after giving effect to such assignment the Assignee
shall have purchased pursuant to this Assignment Agreement the percentage
interest specified in Item 3 of Schedule 1 of all outstanding rights and
obligations under the Credit Agreement relating to the facilities listed in Item
3 of Schedule 1 and the other Loan Documents. The aggregate Commitment (or
Loans, if the applicable Commitment has been terminated) purchased by the
Assignee hereunder is set forth in Item 4 of Schedule 1.

         3.       EFFECTIVE DATE. The effective date of this Assignment
Agreement (the "Effective Date") shall be the later of the date specified in
Item 5 of Schedule 1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period agreed to by
the Agent) after a Notice of Assignment substantially in the form of Annex "I"
attached hereto has been delivered to the Agent. Such Notice of Assignment must
include any consents required to be delivered to the Agent by Section 12.3.1 of
the Credit Agreement. In no event will the Effective Date occur if the payments
required to be made by the Assignee to the Assignor on the Effective Date under
Sections 4 and 5 hereof are not made on the proposed Effective Date. The
Assignor will notify the Assignee of the proposed Effective Date no later than
the Business Day prior to the proposed Effective Date. As of the Effective Date,
(i) the Assignee shall have the rights and obligations of a Lender under the
Loan Documents with respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the
Assignee hereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall relinquish its rights and be
released from its corresponding obligations under the Loan Documents with
respect to the rights and obligations assigned to the Assignee hereunder.

         4.       PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. On and after the Effective Date, the
Assignee shall be entitled to receive from the Agent all payments of principal,
interest and fees with respect to the interest assigned hereby. The Assignee
shall advance funds directly to the Agent with respect to all Loans and
reimbursement payments made on or after the Effective Date with respect to the
interest assigned hereby. **[In consideration for the sale and assignment of
Loans hereunder, (i) the Assignee shall pay the Assignor, on the Effective Date,
an amount equal to the principal amount of the portion of all Alternate Base
Rate Loans assigned to the Assignee hereunder and (ii) with respect to each
Eurodollar Loan made by the Assignor and assigned to the Assignee hereunder
which is outstanding on the Effective Date, (a) on the last day of the

<PAGE>

Interest Period therefor or (b) on such earlier date agreed to by the Assignor
and the Assignee or (c) on the date on which any such Eurodollar Loan becomes
due (by acceleration or otherwise) (the date as described in the foregoing
clauses (a), (b) or (c) being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment Date"),
the Assignee shall pay the Assignor an amount equal to the principal amount of
the portion of such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the Assignee which is
outstanding on the Payment Date. If the Assignor and the Assignee agree that the
Payment Date for such Eurodollar Loan shall be the Effective Date, they shall
agree to the interest rate applicable to the portion of such Loan assigned
hereunder for the period from the Effective Date to the end of the existing
Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (the "Agreed Interest Rate")
and any interest received by the Assignee in excess of the Agreed Interest Rate
shall be remitted to the Assignor. In the event interest for the period from the
Effective Date to but not including the Payment Date is not paid by the Borrower
with respect to any Eurodollar Loan sold by the Assignor to the Assignee
hereunder, the Assignee shall pay to the Assignor interest for such period on
the portion of such Eurodollar Loan sold by the Assignor to the Assignee
hereunder at the applicable rate provided by the Credit Agreement. In the event
a prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan which is existing on the Payment Date and
assigned by the Assignor to the Assignee hereunder occurs after the Payment Date
but before the end of the Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan,
the Assignee shall remit to the Assignor the excess of the prepayment penalty
paid with respect to the portion of such Eurodollar Loan assigned to the
Assignee hereunder over the amount which would have been paid if such prepayment
penalty was calculated based on the Agreed Interest Rate. The Assignee will also
promptly remit to the Assignor (i) any principal payments received from the
Agent with respect to Eurodollar Loans prior to the Payment Date and (ii) any
amounts of interest on Loans and fees received from the Agent which relate to
the portion of the Loans assigned to the Assignee hereunder for periods prior to
the Effective Date, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Loans or fees, or the
Payment Date, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, and not previously paid by the
Assignee to the Assignor.]** In the event that either party hereto receives any
payment to which the other party hereto is entitled under this Assignment
Agreement, then the party receiving such amount shall promptly remit it to the
other party hereto.

**Each Assignor may insert its standard payment provisions in lieu of the
payment terms included in this Exhibit.

         5.       FEES PAYABLE BY THE ASSIGNEE. The Assignee shall pay to the
Assignor a fee on each day on which a payment of interest or fees is made under
the Credit Agreement with respect to the amounts assigned to the Assignee
hereunder (other than a payment of interest or commitment fees for the period
prior to the Effective Date or, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the Payment
Date, which the Assignee is obligated to deliver to the Assignor pursuant to
Section 4 hereof). The amount of such fee shall be the difference between (i)
the interest or fee, as applicable, paid with respect to the amounts assigned to
the Assignee hereunder and (ii) the interest or fee, as applicable, which would
have been paid with respect to the amounts assigned to the Assignee hereunder if
each interest rate was __ of 1% less than the interest rate paid by the Borrower
or if the commitment fee was __ of 1% less than the commitment fee paid by the
Borrower, as applicable. In addition, the Assignee agrees to pay __% of the
recordation fee required to be paid to the Agent in connection with this

         [NAME OF AGENT]

From:    [NAME OF ASSIGNOR] (the "Assignor")

         [NAME OF ASSIGNEE] (the "Assignee")

                  1.       We refer to that Credit Agreement (the "Credit
Agreement") described in Item 1 of Schedule 1 attached hereto ("Schedule 1").
Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings attributed to them in the Credit Agreement.

                  2.       This Notice of Assignment (this "Notice") is given
and delivered to *[the Borrower and]* the Agent pursuant to Section 12.3.2 of
the Credit Agreement.

                  3.       The Assignor and the Assignee have entered into an
Assignment Agreement, dated as of _________, 200_ (the "Assignment"), pursuant
to which, among other things, the Assignor has sold, assigned, delegated and
transferred to the Assignee, and the Assignee has purchased, accepted and
assumed from the Assignor the percentage interest specified in Item 3 of
Schedule 1 of all outstandings, rights and obligations under the Credit
Agreement relating to the facilities listed in Item 3 of Schedule 1. The
Effective Date of the Assignment shall be the later of the date specified in
Item 5 of Schedule 1 or two Business Days (or such shorter period as agreed to
by the Agent) after this Notice of Assignment and any consents and fees required
by Sections [12.3.1 and 12.3.2] of the Credit Agreement have been delivered to
the Agent, provided that the Effective Date shall not occur if any condition
precedent agreed to by the Assignor and the Assignee has not been satisfied.

*To be included only if consent must be obtained from the Borrower pursuant to
Section 12.3.1 of the Credit Agreement.

                  4.       The Assignor and the Assignee hereby give to the
Borrower and the Agent notice of the assignment and delegation referred to
herein. The Assignor will confer with the Agent before the date specified in
Item 5 of Schedule 1 to determine if the Assignment Agreement will become
effective on such date pursuant to Section 3 hereof, and will confer with the
Agent to determine the Effective Date pursuant to Section 3 hereof if it occurs
thereafter.

<PAGE>

The Assignor shall notify the Agent if the Assignment Agreement does not become
effective on any proposed Effective Date as a result of the failure to satisfy
the conditions precedent agreed to by the Assignor and the Assignee. At the
request of the Agent, the Assignor will give the Agent written confirmation of
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent.

                  5.       The Assignor or the Assignee shall pay to the Agent
on or before the Effective Date the processing fee of $3,500 required by Section
12.3.2 of the Credit Agreement.

                  6.       If Notes are outstanding on the Effective Date, the
Assignor and the Assignee request and direct that the Agent prepare and cause
the Borrower to execute and deliver new Notes or, as appropriate, replacement
notes, to the Assignor and the Assignee. The Assignor and, if applicable, the
Assignee each agree to deliver to the Agent the original Note received by it
from the Borrower upon its receipt of a new Note in the appropriate amount.

                  7.       The Assignee advises the Agent that notice and
payment instructions are set forth in the attachment to Schedule 1.

                  8.       The Assignee hereby represents and warrants that none
of the funds, monies, assets or other consideration being used to make the
purchase pursuant to the Assignment are "plan assets" as defined under ERISA and
that its rights, benefits, and interests in and under the Loan Documents will
not be "plan assets" under ERISA.

                  9.       The Assignee authorizes the Agent to act as its agent
under the Loan Documents in accordance with the terms thereof. The Assignee
acknowledges that the Agent has no duty to supply information with respect to
the Borrower or the Loan Documents to the Assignee until the Assignee becomes a
party to the Credit Agreement.*

*May be eliminated if Assignee is a party to the Credit Agreement prior to the
Effective Date.

                          AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT

         This ________ Amendment to Credit Agreement ("Amendment") is made as of
________________, _____ by and among PULTE MORTGAGE LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Borrower"), _______________________(the "Increasing
Lender"), and BANK ONE, NA ("Agent") as administrative agent.

                                    RECITALS

         A.       The Borrower, the Agent and certain other lenders are parties
to that certain Fourth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement dated as
of March 31, 2003 (as amended from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). All
capitalized terms used in this Amendment and not otherwise defined shall have
the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Credit Agreement.

         B.       The Borrower desires to amend the Credit Agreement to
temporarily increase the Aggregate Commitment and [Increasing Lender] is willing
to provide the full amount of such temporary increase on the terms stated
herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   AGREEMENTS

         1.       Temporary Increase. As of the "Effective Date" (as defined
below), the Aggregate Commitment shall be increased from $_____________ to
$_____________ by an increase in [Lender's] Commitment from $_____________ to
$_____________. Upon the Effective Date, after giving effect to such increase,
the Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages shall be shown on revised
Schedule "1" attached to this Amendment. Such increase shall end on
_____________ (the "Reduction Date"). Upon the Reduction Date, [Lender's]
Commitment shall be reduced by $_____________ to the amount in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Date. After giving effect to such reduction
and subject to any intervening changes in the Aggregate Commitment and the
Lenders' respective Commitment Percentages shall be returned to the percentages
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Date.

         2.       Reduction Date Adjustment. On the Reduction Date the Borrower
shall repay the amount, if any, by which the aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Loans exceeds the reduced Aggregate Commitment. The Agent shall
allocate such principal repayment among the Lenders so that each Lender's share
of all Loans (other than Bid Loans) as of the end of the business on the
Reduction Date is equal to such Lender's new Commitment Percentage after giving
effect to such reduction in the Aggregate Commitment.

<PAGE>

         3.       Effective Date. The "Effective Date" shall be deemed to have
occurred on the date that all of the following conditions have been fulfilled:

                  (i)      this Amendment has been fully executed and delivered;

                  (ii)     the Borrower has executed and delivered to [Lender]
         an amended and restated Note in the amount of its increased Commitment;

                  (iii)    the Agent has received a certified resolution from
         the members of the Borrower and of any other body authorizing the
         execution of the Loan Documents to which it is a party authorizing this
         Amendment; and

                  (iv)     the Borrower has paid any upfront fee due to [the
         Increasing Lender] with respect to such increase in its Commitment.

         4.       Miscellaneous.

                  (i)      The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders
         that (i) after giving effect to this Amendment, no Default or Unmatured
         Default exists, (ii) the Credit Agreement is in full force and effect,
         and (iii) the Borrower has no defenses or offsets to, or claims or
         counterclaims, relating to, its obligations under the Credit Agreement.

                  (ii)     All of the obligations of the parties to the Credit
         Agreement, as amended hereby, are hereby ratified and confirmed. All
         references in the Loan Documents to the "Credit Agreement" henceforth
         shall be deemed to refer to the Credit Agreement as amended by this
         Amendment.

                  (iii)    Nothing contained in this Amendment shall be
         construed to disturb, discharge, cancel, impair or extinguish the
         indebtedness evidenced by the existing Notes and secured by the Loan
         Documents or waive, release, impair, or affect the liens arising under
         the Loan Documents or the validity or priority thereof.

                  (iv)     In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between
         the provisions of the Loan Documents and the provisions of this
         Amendment, the provisions of this Amendment shall govern. The
         provisions of this Amendment, the Credit Agreement, the Security
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents are in full force and effect
         except as amended herein and the Loan Documents as so amended are
         ratified and confirmed hereby by the Borrower.

                  (v)      The Borrower agrees to reimburse the Agent and the
         Increasing Lender for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
         legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the preparation,
         negotiation and consummation of this Amendment.

                  (vi)     This Amendment shall be effective as of the date that
         the Agent has received executed counterparts of this Amendment from the
         Borrower and the Increasing Lender.

<PAGE>

                  (vii)    This Amendment may be executed in counterparts which,
         taken together, shall constitute a single document.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this
         Agreement to be duly executed by their duly authorized officers, all as
         of the day and year written below:

whose identity the Agent will approve by its signature below.

         In consideration of the foregoing, such Supplemental Lender, from and
after the date hereof shall have a Commitment of $______________ resulting in a
new Aggregate Commitment of $______________ as of the date hereof, and if it is
a new Lender, the Supplemental Lender hereby assumes all of the rights and
obligations of a Lender under the Credit Agreement.

         The Borrower has executed and delivered to the Supplemental Lender as
of the date hereof, if requested by the Supplemental Lender, a new amended and
restated Note in the form attached to the Credit Agreement as Exhibit A to
evidence the increased Commitment of the Supplemental Lender.
