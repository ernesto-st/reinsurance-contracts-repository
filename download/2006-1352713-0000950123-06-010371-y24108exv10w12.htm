</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Award Agreement and the RSUs granted hereby are subject to the Plan, the terms of which
are incorporated herein by reference. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the Plan

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to the conditions contained herein and in the Plan, RAM grants to the Grantee, as of
the Date of Grant, the number of RSUs specified above in the Notice of Restricted Share Unit Grant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(a)&nbsp;General</B>. Each RSU shall represent the unsecured promise of RAM to transfer to the
Grantee, on the settlement date of such RSU and subject to the terms and conditions set

not previously vested shall vest in full upon the termination of the Grantee&#146;s
employment with RAM and its Subsidiaries (A)&nbsp;by reason of death, Permanent
Disability, or Retirement and in each case after at least three years of continuous
service with RAM and its Subsidiaries (including service within a corporation or

Cause, <U>provided</u> <u>that</u>
such termination is within one year following a Change in Control, or (C)&nbsp;without

<U>further</U> that such third party does not thereafter re-employ the Grantee in a
similar position and title and with similar responsibilities and at least the same
compensation (as provided in the Grantee&#146;s Employment Agreement if applicable).
&#147;Permanent Disability&#148; shall mean circumstances that entitled the Grantee to receive
benefits under the long-term disability policy maintained by RAM or any of its
Subsidiaries for the Grantee. &#147;Retirement&#148; shall mean the termination of the
Grantee&#146;s employment on or after age 55 with at least ten years of service with RAM,

anything in this Award Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, no settlement of
RSUs in connection with the Grantee&#146;s termination of employment (other than by
reason of death) shall be made earlier than the date which is six months and one day
following the date of such termination of employment or, if earlier, the date of the
Grantee&#146;s death following termination of employment.

employees).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 3%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(f)&nbsp;Immediate Cancellation of RSUs and Return of Share Value. </B>Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Award Agreement, the Committee may (i)&nbsp;cancel all or any portion of
the RSUs then outstanding (whether or not then vested and whether or not subject to a
deferred settlement election) and (ii)&nbsp;may require the Grantee to repay to RAM all or any
portion of the Share Value (as hereinafter defined) that the Grantee realizes from the
settlement of RSUs occurring within six months before or one year after the Grantee&#146;s
termination of employment (other than a termination of the Grantee&#146;s employment due to the
expiration of the term of the Grantee&#146;s Employment Agreement, if applicable) with RAM and
its Subsidiaries, if the Grantee engages in Competitive Activity (as defined herein) within
one year following such termination of employment. The Grantee will be considered to engage
in &#147;Competitive Activity&#148; if the Grantee (i)&nbsp;enters into a relationship as an employee,
officer, partner, member, director, independent contractor, consultant, advisor, or agent
of, or in any similar relationship with, any corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other business entity that engages in a financial guaranty
reinsurance business, whether existing or to be formed, without regard to its claims-paying
ability (a &#147;Competitor&#148;), where the Grantee will be responsible for providing services which
are similar or substantially related to the services that the Grantee provided during any of
the last three years of the Grantee&#146;s employment with RAM and its Subsidiaries, or (ii)
either alone, or in concert with others, acquires or maintains beneficial ownership (within
the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of 5% or
more of any class of equity securities of a Competitor. For purposes hereof, &#147;Share Value&#148;
in respect of a RSU means a cash amount equal to the amount of income that would be
reportable in respect of the settlement of such RSU on the Grantee&#146;s Form W-2 (or successor
form) if RAM issued such a form to the Grantee, as determined by the Committee in its sole
discretion for the year in which such settlement occurs. If the Grantee is required to
repay any Share Value to RAM pursuant to this Section&nbsp;3(f), the Grantee shall pay such
amount in such manner and on such terms and conditions as RAM may require, and RAM shall be
entitled to withhold or set-off against any other amount owed to the Grantee by RAM or its
Subsidiaries (other than any amount owed to the Grantee under any retirement plan intended
to be qualified under Code Section&nbsp;401(a)) up to an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid
obligation of the Grantee under this Section&nbsp;3(f).

the delivery of any certificates evidencing Common Shares to be issued in connection with
the full or partial settlement of the RSUs, RAM shall have the right to require the Grantee
to remit to RAM an amount sufficient to satisfy the minimum Federal, State and local tax
withholding requirements. To the extent permitted by applicable law, RAM may permit the
Grantee to satisfy, in whole or in part, such obligation to remit the minimum statutory
withholding amount of taxes by directing RAM to withhold Common Shares that would otherwise
be received by the Grantee, pursuant to such rules as the Committee may establish from time
to time. Under no circumstances will RAM permit the Grantee to withhold Common Shares in
excess of the maximum Federal, state and local withholding requirements.
