and from time to time on or after the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date, a revolving loan or revolving loans (each, a
"Revolving Loan" and, collectively, the "Revolving Loans") to the


                                      -55-

<PAGE>

Borrower, which Revolving Loans (i) shall be denominated in the respective
Available Currency elected by the Borrower, (ii) shall, at the option of
Borrower, be incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, Base Rate Loans,
Eurodollar Loans, Euro Denominated Loans or Sterling Denominated Loans, provided
that except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 2.10(b), all Revolving
Loans comprising the same Borrowing shall at all times be of the same Type,
(iii) may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof,
(iv) shall not be made (and shall not be required to be made) by any Lender in
any instance where the incurrence thereof (after giving effect to the use of the
proceeds thereof on the date of the incurrence thereof to repay any amounts
theretofore outstanding pursuant to this Agreement) would cause the Aggregate
Exposure to exceed the Borrowing Base at such time (based on the Borrowing Base
Certificate last delivered) and (v) in the case of any Borrowing of (A) Euro
Denominated Loans shall not be made (and shall not be required to be made) by
any Lender in any instance where the incurrence thereof would cause the Euro
Denominated Obligations to exceed the Maximum Euro Denominated Obligations
Amount or (B) Sterling Denominated Loans shall not be made (and shall not be
required to be made) by any Lender in any instance where the incurrence thereof
would cause the Sterling Denominated Obligations to exceed the Maximum Sterling
Denominated Loan Amount.

          (b) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Swingline Lender agrees to make, at any time and from time to time on or after
the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the Swingline Expiry Date, a revolving
loan or revolving loans (each, a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the
"Swingline Loans") to the Borrower, which Swingline Loans (i) shall be incurred
and maintained as Base Rate Loans, (ii) shall be denominated in Dollars, (iii)
may be repaid and reborrowed in accordance with the provisions hereof, (iv)
shall not exceed in aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding, when
combined with the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans then
outstanding and the aggregate amount of all Letter of Credit Outstandings at
such time, an amount equal to the Total Commitment at such time, (v) shall not
be made (and shall not be required to be made) by any Lender in any instance
where the incurrence thereof (after giving effect to the use of the proceeds
thereof on the date of the incurrence thereof to repay any amounts theretofore
outstanding pursuant to this Agreement) would cause the Aggregate Exposure to
exceed the Borrowing Base at such time (based on the Borrowing Base Certificate
last delivered) and (vi) shall not exceed in aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding the Maximum Swingline Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 2.01(b), (i) the Swingline Lender shall not
be obligated to make any Swingline Loans at a time when a Lender Default exists
with respect to an Lender unless the Swingline Lender has entered into
arrangements satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate the Swingline
Lender's risk with respect to the Defaulting Lender's or Defaulting Lenders'
participation in such Swingline Loans, including by cash collateralizing such
Defaulting Lender's or Defaulting Lenders' RL Percentage of the outstanding
Swingline Loans, and (ii) the Swingline Lender shall not make any Swingline Loan
after it has received written notice from the Borrower, any other Credit Party
or the Required Lenders stating that a Default or an Event of Default exists and
is continuing until such time as the Swingline Lender shall have received
written notice (A) of rescission of all such notices from the party or parties
originally delivering such notice or notices or (B) of the waiver of such
Default or Event of Default by the Required Lenders.


                                      -56-

<PAGE>

          (c) On any Business Day, the Swingline Lender may, in its sole
discretion, give notice to the Lenders that the Swingline Lender's outstanding
Swingline Loans shall be funded with one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans
(provided that such notice shall be deemed to have been automatically given upon
the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 11.05 or upon
the exercise of any of the remedies provided in the last paragraph of Section
11), in which case one or more Borrowings of Revolving Loans constituting Base
Rate Loans (each such Borrowing, a "Mandatory Borrowing") shall be made on the
immediately succeeding Business Day by all Lenders pro rata based on each such
Lender's RL Percentage (determined before giving effect to any termination of
the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 11) and
the proceeds thereof shall be applied directly by the Swingline Lender to repay
the Swingline Lender for such outstanding Swingline Loans. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably agrees to make Revolving Loans upon one Business Day's notice
pursuant to each Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified
in the preceding sentence and on the date specified in writing by the Swingline
Lender notwithstanding (i) the amount of the Mandatory Borrowing may not comply
with the Minimum Borrowing Amount otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any
conditions specified in Section 7 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or
an Event of Default then exists, (iv) the date of such Mandatory Borrowing, and
(v) the amount of the Borrowing Base or Total Commitment at such time. In the
event that any Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason be made on the date
otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of the
commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the
Borrower), then each Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as
of the date the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted
for any payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to
such purchase) from the Swingline Lender such participations in the outstanding
Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause the Lenders to share in such
Swingline Loans ratably based upon their respective RL Percentages (determined
before giving effect to any termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments
pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 11), provided that (x) all interest
payable on the Swingline Loans shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender
until the date as of which the respective participation is required to be
purchased and, to the extent attributable to the purchased participation, shall
be payable to the participant from and after such date and (y) at the time any
purchase of participations pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the
purchasing Lender shall be required to pay the Swingline Lender interest on the
principal amount of participation purchased for each day from and including the
day upon which the Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but
excluding the date of payment for such participation, at the overnight Federal
Funds Rate for the first three days and at the interest rate otherwise
applicable to Revolving Loans maintained as Base Rate Loans hereunder for each
day thereafter.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.01(a) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the right to
establish reserves in such amounts, and with respect to such matters, as the
Administrative Agent in its Permitted Discretion shall deem necessary or
appropriate, against the Borrowing Base, including, without limitation, reserves
with respect to (i) sums that the Borrower is or will be required to pay (such
as taxes, assessments, insurance premiums, or, in the case of leased assets,
rents or other amounts payable under such leases) and have not yet paid
(including, without limitation, a Rent Reserve against Eligible Inventory
included in the Borrowing Base) and (ii) amounts owing by the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries to any Person to the extent secured by a Lien on, or trust over,
any


                                      -57-

<PAGE>

of the Collateral, which Lien or trust, in the Permitted Discretion of the
Administrative Agent is capable of ranking senior in priority to or pari passu
with one or more of the Liens granted in the Security Documents (such as Liens
or trusts in favor of landlords, warehousemen, carriers, mechanics, materialmen,
laborers, or suppliers, or Liens or trusts for ad valorem, excise, sales, or
other taxes where given priority under applicable law) in and to such item of
the Collateral. In addition to the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall
have the right to have the Borrower's and each Wholly-Owned Subsidiary
Guarantor's Inventory reappraised by a qualified appraisal company selected by
the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 9.01(p) after the Initial
Borrowing Date for the purpose of re-determining the Net Orderly Liquidation
Value of the Eligible Inventory, and, as a result, re-determining the Borrowing
Base.

          (e) In the event the Borrower is unable to comply with (i) the
Borrowing Base limitations set forth in Sections 2.01(a) or (ii) the conditions
precedent to the making of Revolving Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit
set forth in Section 7, (x) the Lenders authorize the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the Lenders, to make Revolving Loans to the Borrower, which, in
each case, may only be made as Base Rate Loans (each, an "Agent Advance") for a
period commencing on the date the Administrative Agent first receives a Notice
of Borrowing requesting an Agent Advance until the earlier of (i) the twentieth
Business Day after such date, (ii) the date the Borrower is again able to comply
with the Borrowing Base limitations and the conditions precedent to the making
of Revolving Loans and issuance of Letters of Credit, or obtains an amendment or
waiver with respect thereto or (iii) the date the Required Lenders instruct the
Administrative Agent to cease making Agent Advances (in each case, the "Agent
Advance Period"). The Administrative Agent shall not make any Agent Advance to
the extent that at such time the amount of such Agent Advance, either (I) when
added to the aggregate outstanding amount of all other Agent Advances made to
the Borrower at such time, would exceed 10% of the Borrowing Base at such time
(based on the Borrowing Base Certificate last delivered) or (II) which are
incurred as Revolving Loans, when added to the Aggregate Exposure as then in
effect (immediately prior to the incurrence of such Agent Advance), would exceed
the Total Commitment at such time. It is understood and agreed that, subject to
the requirements set forth above, Agent Advances may be made by the
Administrative Agent in its sole discretion and that the Borrower shall have no
right to require that any Agent Advances be made. Agent Advances will be subject
to periodic settlement with the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.04.

          2.02. Minimum Amount of Each Borrowing. The aggregate principal amount
of each Borrowing of Loans shall not be less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount.
More than one Borrowing may occur on the same date, but at no time shall there
be outstanding more than 15 Borrowings of Euro Rate Loans.

          2.03. Notice of Borrowing. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur
(x) Eurodollar Loans hereunder, the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent
at the Notice Office at least three Business Days' prior notice of each
Eurodollar Loan to be incurred hereunder and (y) Base Rate Loans hereunder
(excluding Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory
Borrowing), the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent at the Notice
Office at least one Business Day's prior notice of each Base Rate Loan to be
incurred hereunder, provided that (in each case) any such notice shall be deemed
to have been given on a certain day only if given before 2:00 P.M. (New York
City time) on such day. Each such notice


                                      -58-

<PAGE>

(each, a "Notice of Borrowing"), except as otherwise expressly provided in
Section 2.10, shall be irrevocable and shall be in writing, or by telephone
promptly confirmed in writing, in the form of Exhibit A-1, appropriately
completed to specify: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the Loans to be
incurred pursuant to such Borrowing (stated in the relevant currency), (ii) the
date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) whether the Loans
being incurred pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially maintained as Base
Rate Loans or, to the extent permitted hereunder, Euro Rate Loans and, if Euro
Rate Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, and (v) in the
case of a Borrowing of Revolving Loans the proceeds of which are to be utilized
to finance, in whole or in part, a Permitted Acquisition (or to pay any fees and
expenses incurred in connection therewith), the amount of the Borrowing
Availability after giving effect to such Borrowing. The Administrative Agent
shall promptly give each Lender which is required to make Loans specified in the
respective Notice of Borrowing, notice of such proposed Borrowing, of such
Lender's proportionate share thereof and of the other matters required by the
immediately preceding sentence to be specified in the Notice of Borrowing.

          (b) (i) Whenever the Borrower desires to incur Swingline Loans
hereunder, the Borrower shall give the Swingline Lender no later than 1:00 P.M.
(New York City time) on the date that a Swingline Loan is to be incurred,
written notice or telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing of each
Swingline Loan to be incurred hereunder. Each such notice shall be irrevocable
and specify in each case (A) the date of Borrowing (which shall be a Business
Day), (B) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans to be incurred
pursuant to such Borrowing, and (C) in the case of a Borrowing of Swingline
Loans the proceeds of which are to be utilized to finance, in whole or in part,
a Permitted Acquisition (or to pay any fees and expenses incurred in connection
therewith), the amount of the Borrowing Availability after giving effect to such
Borrowing.

          (ii) Mandatory Borrowings shall be made upon the notice specified in
Section 2.01(c), with the Borrower irrevocably agreeing, by its incurrence of
any Swingline Loan, to the making of the Mandatory Borrowings as set forth in
Section 2.01(c).

          (c) Without in any way limiting the obligation of the Borrower to
confirm in writing any telephonic notice of any Borrowing or prepayment of
Loans, the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, may
act without liability upon the basis of telephonic notice of such Borrowing or
prepayment, as the case may be, believed by the Administrative Agent or the
Swingline Lender, as the case may be, in good faith to be from an Authorized
Officer of the Borrower, prior to receipt of written confirmation. In each such
case, the Borrower hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent's
or the Swingline Lender's record of the terms of such telephonic notice of such
Borrowing or prepayment of Loans, as the case may be, absent manifest error.

          2.04. Disbursement of Funds. (a) No later than 1:00 P.M. (New York
City time) on the date specified in each Notice of Borrowing (or (x) in the case
of Swingline Loans, no later than 3:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date
specified pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i) or (y) in the case of Mandatory
Borrowings, no later than 10:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date specified
in Section 2.01(c)), each Lender with a Revolving Loan Commitment of the
respective Tranche will make available its pro rata portion (determined in
accordance with Section 2.07) of each such Borrowing requested to be made on
such date (or in the case of


                                      -59-

<PAGE>

Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender will make available the full amount
thereof). All such amounts will be made available in Dollars (in the case of
Dollar Denominated Loans), in Euros (in the case of Euro Denominated Loans) or
in Sterling (in the case of Sterling Denominated Loans) and in immediately
available funds at the Payment Office, and the Administrative Agent will, except
in the case of Revolving Loans made pursuant to a Mandatory Borrowing, make
available to the Borrower at the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so
made available by the Lenders. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by any Lender prior to the date of Borrowing that such Lender does not
intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion of
any Borrowing to be made on such date, the Administrative Agent may assume that
such Lender has made such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such
date of Borrowing and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to), in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available
to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to recover such corresponding amount on demand from such Lender. If
such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount forthwith upon the
Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay such corresponding
amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent also shall be
entitled to recover on demand from such Lender or the Borrower, as the case may
be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day from the date
such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative Agent to the
Borrower until the date such corresponding amount is recovered by the
Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if recovered from such
Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at the
interest rate otherwise applicable to such Loans for each day thereafter and
(ii) if recovered from the Borrower, the rate of interest applicable to the
respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant to Section 2.08. Nothing in this
Section 2.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to make
Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the Borrower may have against
any Lender as a result of any failure by such Lender to make Loans hereunder.

          (b) Unless the Required Lenders have instructed the Administrative
Agent to the contrary, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may,
but shall not be obligated to, make Revolving Loans to the Borrower that are
maintained as Base Rate Loans under Section 2.01 without prior notice of the
proposed Borrowing to the Lenders as follows:

          (i) The amount of each Lender's RL Percentage of Revolving Loans shall
     be computed weekly (or more frequently in the Administrative Agent's sole
     discretion) and shall be adjusted upward or downward on the basis of the
     amount of outstanding Revolving Loans as of 5:00 P.M. (New York time) on
     the last Business Day of each week, or such other period specified by the
     Administrative Agent (each such date, a "Settlement Date"). The Lenders
     shall transfer to the Administrative Agent, or the Administrative Agent
     shall transfer to the Lenders such amounts as are necessary so that (after
     giving effect to all such transfers) the amount of Revolving Loans made by
     each Lender shall be equal to such Lender's RL Percentage of the aggregate
     amount of Revolving Loans outstanding as of such Settlement Date. If a
     notice from the Administrative Agent of any such necessary transfer is
     received by a Lender on or prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on any
     Business Day, then such Lender shall make transfers described above in
     immediately available funds no later than 3:00 P.M. (New


                                      -60-

<PAGE>

     York time) on the day such notice was received; and if such notice is
     received by a Lender after 12:00 Noon (New York time) on any Business Day,
     such Lender shall make such transfers no later than 1:00 P.M. (New York
     time) on the next succeeding Business Day. The obligation of each of the
     Lenders to transfer such funds shall be irrevocable and unconditional and
     without recourse to, or without representation or warranty by, the
     Administrative Agent. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender
     agrees and the Lenders agree to mark their respective books and records on
     each Settlement Date to show at all times the dollar amount of their
     respective RL Percentage of the outstanding Revolving Loans on such date.

          (ii) To the extent that the settlement described in preceding clause
     (i) shall not yet have occurred with respect to any particular Settlement
     Date, upon any repayment of Revolving Loans by the Borrower prior to such
     settlement, the Administrative Agent may apply such amounts repaid directly
     to the amounts that would otherwise be made available by the Administrative
     Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04(b).

          (iii) Because the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders may be
     advancing and/or may be repaid Revolving Loans prior to the time when the
     Lenders will actually advance and/or be repaid Revolving Loans, interest
     with respect to Revolving Loans shall be allocated by the Administrative
     Agent to each Lender and the Administrative Agent in accordance with the
     amount of Revolving Loans actually advanced by and repaid to each Lender
     and the Administrative Agent and shall accrue from and including the date
     such Revolving Loans are so advanced to but excluding the date such
     Revolving Loans are either repaid by the Borrower in accordance with the
     terms of this Agreement or actually settled by the Administrative Agent or
     the applicable Lender as described in this Section 2.04(b).

          2.05. Notes. (a) The Borrower's obligation to pay the principal of,
and interest on, the Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced in the
Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.15 and
shall, if requested by such Lender, also be evidenced (i) in the case of
Revolving Loans, by a promissory note duly executed and delivered by the
Borrower substantially in the form of Exhibit B-1, with blanks appropriately
completed in conformity herewith (each, a "Revolving Note" and, collectively,
the "Revolving Notes"), and (ii) in the case of Swingline Loans, by a promissory
note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the form of
Exhibit B-2, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith (the
"Swingline Note").

          (b) The Revolving Note issued to each Lender shall (i) be executed by
the Borrower, (ii) be payable to the order of such Lender (or an affiliate
designated by such Lender) or its registered assigns and be dated the Initial
Borrowing Date (or, if issued thereafter, the date of issuance thereof), (iii)
be in a stated principal amount (expressed in Dollars) equal to the Revolving
Loan Commitment of such Lender on the date of issuance thereof (or, if issued
after the termination of such Revolving Loan Commitment, in an amount equal to
the Exposure of the respective Lender), provided that if, because of
fluctuations in exchange rates after the date of issuance thereof, the Revolving
Note of any Lender would not be at least as great as the outstanding principal
amount (taking the Dollar Equivalent of all Euro Denominated Loans and Sterling
Denominated Loans evidenced thereby) of the Revolving Loans made by such Lender
at


                                      -61-

<PAGE>

any time outstanding, the respective Lender may request (and in such case the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver) a new Revolving Note in an amount
equal to the aggregate principal amount (taking the Dollar Equivalent of all
Euro Denominated Loans and Sterling Denominated Loans evidenced thereby) of the
Revolving Loans of such Lender outstanding on the date of the issuance of such
new Revolving Note, (iv) with respect to each Revolving Loan evidenced thereby,
be payable in the respective Available Currency in which such Revolving Loan was
made, (v) mature on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, (vi) bear interest as
provided in the appropriate clauses of Section 2.08 in respect of the Revolving
Loans evidenced thereby from time to time, (vii) be subject to voluntary
prepayment as provided in Section 5.01 and mandatory repayment as provided in
Section 5.02 and (viii) be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents.

          (c) The Swingline Note issued to the Swingline Lender shall (i) be
executed by the Borrower, (ii) be payable to the order of the Swingline Lender
or its registered assigns and be dated the Initial Borrowing Date, (iii) be in a
stated principal amount (expressed in Dollars) equal to the Maximum Swingline
Amount and be payable in Dollars in the principal amount of the outstanding
Swingline Loans evidenced thereby from time to time, (iv) mature on the
Swingline Expiry Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause
of Section 2.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans evidenced thereby, (vi) be
subject to voluntary prepayment as provided in Section 5.01 and mandatory
repayment as provided in Section 5.02 and (vii) be entitled to the benefits of
this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

          (d) Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount of each
Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and prior to any transfer of
any of its Notes will endorse on the reverse side thereof the outstanding
principal amount of Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to make any such notation
or any error in such notation shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in
respect of such Loans.

          (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this
Section 2.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Notes shall only be delivered to
Lenders which at any time specifically request the delivery of such Notes. No
failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Note evidencing its Loans to the
Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the obligations of the Borrower to
pay the Loans (and all related Obligations) incurred by the Borrower which would
otherwise be evidenced thereby in accordance with the requirements of this
Agreement, and shall not in any way affect the security or guaranties therefor
provided pursuant to the various Credit Documents. Any Lender which does not
have a Note evidencing its outstanding Loans shall in no event be required to
make the notations otherwise described in preceding clause (b). At any time when
any Lender requests the delivery of a Note to evidence any of its Loans, the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the
requested Note in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Loans.

          2.06. Conversions. The Borrower shall have the option to convert, on
any Business Day beginning three Business Days following the Initial Borrowing
Date, all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum Borrowing Amount of the
outstanding principal amount of Loans (other than Swingline Loans which may not
be converted pursuant to this Section 2.06) made pursuant to one or more
Borrowings of one or more Types of Loans into a Borrowing of another Type of
Loan, provided that, (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.10(b),


                                      -62-

<PAGE>

Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans only on the last day of
an Interest Period applicable to the Loans being converted and no such partial
conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of
such Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the
Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, (ii) unless the Required Lenders
otherwise agree, Base Rate Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if
no Default or Event of Default is in existence on the date of the conversion,
and (iii) no conversion pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall result in a greater
number of Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans than is permitted under Section 2.02.
Each such conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the
Administrative Agent at the Notice Office prior to 2:00 P.M. (New York City
time) at least (x) in the case of conversions of Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar
Loans, three Business Days' prior notice and (y) in the case of conversions of
Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans, one Business Day's prior notice (each, a
"Notice of Conversion/Continuation"), in each case in the form of Exhibit A-2,
appropriately completed to specify the Loans to be so converted, the Borrowing
or Borrowings pursuant to which such Loans were incurred and, if to be converted
into Euro Rate Loans, the Interest Period to be initially applicable thereto.
The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender prompt notice of any such
proposed conversion affecting any of its Loans.

          2.07. Pro Rata Borrowings. All Borrowings of Revolving Loans under
this Agreement shall be incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their
Revolving Loan Commitments, provided that all Mandatory Borrowings shall be
incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their RL Percentages. It is
understood that no Lender shall be responsible for any default by any other
Lender of its obligation to make Loans hereunder and that each Lender shall be
obligated to make the Loans provided to be made by it hereunder, regardless of
the failure of any other Lender to make its Loans hereunder.

          2.08. Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of
the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date of Borrowing
thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a Eurodollar
Loan pursuant to Section 2.06 or 2.09, as applicable, at a rate per annum which
shall be equal to the sum of the relevant Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate,
each as in effect from time to time.

          (b) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan from the date of Borrowing thereof
until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration or
otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate Loan
pursuant to Section 2.06, 2.09 or 2.10, as applicable, at a rate per annum which
shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of
the relevant Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such
Interest Period plus the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

          (c) The Borrower hereby agrees to pay interest in respect of the
unpaid principal amount of each Euro Denominated Loan made to it from the date
of the Borrowing thereof until the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration,
prepayment or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall, during each Interest
Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the relevant Applicable Margin
as in effect from time to time plus Euro LIBOR for such Interest Period plus any
Mandatory Costs.

          (d) The Borrower hereby agrees to pay interest in respect of the
unpaid principal amount of each Sterling Denominated Loan made to it from the
date of the Borrowing thereof until the maturity thereof (whether by
acceleration, prepayment or otherwise) at a rate per annum which shall, during
each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum of the relevant
Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time plus Sterling LIBOR for such
Interest Period plus any Mandatory Costs.

          (e) Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law, overdue
interest in respect of (1) in the case of overdue principal of, and interest or
other overdue amounts owing with respect to, Euro Denominated Loans, equal to 2%
per annum in excess of the relevant Applicable Margin as in effect from time to
time plus Euro LIBOR for such successive periods not exceeding three months as
the Administrative Agent may determine from time to time in respect of amounts
comparable to the amount not paid plus any Mandatory Costs, (2) in the case of
overdue principal of, and interest or other amounts owing with respect to,
Sterling Denominated Loans, equal to 2% per annum in excess of the Applicable
Margin for Sterling Denominated Loans as in effect from time to time plus
Sterling LIBOR for such successive periods not exceeding three months as the
Administrative Agent may determine from time to time in respect of amounts
comparable to the amount not paid plus any Mandatory Costs, and (3) for each
other Loan, each Loan shall, in each case, bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the greater of (x) the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate then
borne by such Loans and (y) the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate otherwise
applicable to Base Rate Loans, and all other overdue amounts payable hereunder
and under any other Credit Document shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate applicable to Revolving
Loans that are maintained at Base Rate Loans from time to time. Interest that
accrues under this Section 2.08(c) shall be payable on demand.

          (f) Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be payable (i) in
respect of each Swingline Loan and Base Rate Loan, (x) quarterly in arrears on
each Quarterly Payment Date, (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment in

on demand, and (ii) in respect of each Euro Rate Loan, (x) on the last day of
each Interest Period applicable thereto and, in the case of an Interest Period
in excess of three months, on each date occurring at three month intervals after
the first day of such Interest Period, and (y) on the date of any repayment or
prepayment (on the amount repaid or prepaid), at maturity (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand.

          (g) Upon each Interest Determination Date, the Administrative Agent
shall determine the Euro Rate for each Interest Period applicable to the
respective Euro Rate Loans and shall promptly notify the Borrower and the
Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent manifest error, be final
and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

          2.09. Interest Periods. At the time the Borrower gives any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in respect of the making of, or
conversion into, any Euro Rate Loan (in the case of the initial Interest Period
applicable thereto) or prior to 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third
Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest Period applicable to such
Euro Rate Loan (in the case of any subsequent Interest Period), the Borrower
shall have the right to elect the interest period (each, an "Interest Period")
applicable to such


                                      -64-

<PAGE>

Euro Rate Loan, which Interest Period shall, at the option of the Borrower be a
one, two, three, six or, to the extent approved by each Lender with Loans and/or
Revolving Loan Commitments, any other period, provided that (in each case):

          (i) all Euro Rate Loans comprising a Borrowing shall at all times have
     the same Interest Period;

          (ii) the initial Interest Period for any Euro Rate Loan shall commence
     on the date of Borrowing of such Euro Rate Loan (including the date of any
     conversion thereto from a Base Rate Loan) and each Interest Period
     occurring thereafter in respect of such Euro Rate Loan shall commence on
     the day on which the next preceding Interest Period applicable thereto
     expires;

          (iii) if any Interest Period for a Euro Rate Loan begins on a day for
     which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at
     the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end on the last
     Business Day of such calendar month;

          (iv) if any Interest Period for a Euro Rate Loan would otherwise
     expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest Period shall
     expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided, however, that if any
     Interest Period for a Euro Rate Loan would otherwise expire on a day which
     is not a Business Day but is a day of the month after which no further
     Business Day occurs in such month, such Interest Period shall expire on the
     next preceding Business Day;

          (v) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no Interest Period
     may be selected at any time when a Default or an Event of Default is then
     in existence;

          (vi) no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing shall be selected
     which extends beyond the Revolving Loan Maturity Date; and

With respect to any Non-Dollar Denominated Loans, at the end of any Interest
Period applicable to a Borrowing thereof, the Borrower, may elect to split the
respective Borrowing into two or more Borrowings of the same Type or combine two
or more Borrowings of the same Type into a single Borrowing, in each case, by
having an Authorized Officer of the Borrower give notice thereof together with
its election of one or more Interest Periods, in each case so long as each
resulting Borrowing (x) has an Interest Period which complies with the foregoing
requirements of this Section 2.09, (y) has a principal amount which is not less
than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable to Borrowings of the respective
Type and Tranche, and (z) does not cause a violation of the requirements of
Section 2.02. If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a
Borrowing of Euro Rate Loans, the Borrower has failed to elect, or are not
permitted to elect, a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Euro Rate
Loans as provided above, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected (x) if
Eurodollar Loans, to convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate Loans and (y)
if Non-Dollar Denominated Loans, to select a one-month Interest Period for such
Non-Dollar Denominated Loans, in any such case effective as of the expiration
date of such current Interest Period.

          2.10. Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that any
Lender shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final and


                                      -65-

<PAGE>

conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with respect to clause (i)
below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

          (i) on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of any changes
     arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the applicable interbank
     market, adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
     applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in the definition of
     Euro Rate; or

          (ii) at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased costs or
     reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with respect to
     any Euro Rate Loan because of (x) any change since the Effective Date in
     any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or
     request (whether or not having the force of law) or in the interpretation
     or administration thereof and including the introduction of any new law or
     governmental rule, regulation, order, guideline or request, such as, for
     example, but not limited to: (A) a change in the basis of taxation of
     payment to any Lender of the principal of or interest on the Loans or the
     Notes or any other amounts payable hereunder (except for changes in the
     rate of tax on, or determined by reference to, the net income or net
     profits of such Lender imposed by the jurisdiction in which its principal
     office or applicable lending office is located) or (B) a change in official
     reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding reserves required under
     Regulation D to the extent included in the computation of the Eurodollar
     Rate and/or (y) other circumstances arising since the Effective Date
     affecting such Lender, the interbank market or the position of such Lender
     in such market (whether or not such Lender was a Lender at the time of such
     occurrence);

          (iii) at any time, that the making or continuance of any Euro Rate
     Loan has been made unlawful by any law or governmental rule, regulation or
     order (or would conflict with any governmental rule, regulation, guideline,
     request or order not having the force of law but with which such Lender
     customarily complies even though the failure to comply therewith would not
     be unlawful), or impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after
     the Effective Date which materially and adversely affects the applicable
     interbank market; or

          (iv) at any time that a Non-Dollar Currency is not available in
     sufficient amounts, as determined in good faith by the Administrative
     Agent, to fund any Borrowing of Non-Dollar Denominated Loans requested
     pursuant to Section 2.01;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone confirmed in
writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i) above, to the
Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the Administrative
Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders). Thereafter (w) in
the case of clause (i) above, (A) in the event Eurodollar Loans are so affected,
Eurodollar Loans shall no longer be available until such time as the
Administrative Agent notifies Holdings, the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice by the Administrative Agent no longer
exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation given by
the Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans which have not yet been incurred
(including by way of conversion) shall be deemed rescinded by the Borrower and
(B) in the event that any Non-Dollar Denominated Loan is so affected, the
relevant


                                      -66-

<PAGE>

Euro Rate shall be determined on the basis provided in the proviso to the
definition of the relevant Euro Rate, (x) in the case of clause (ii) above, the
Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon written demand therefor, such
additional amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a different method
of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its sole discretion
shall determine) as shall be required to compensate such Lender for such
increased costs or reductions in amounts received or receivable hereunder (with
the written notice as to the additional amounts owed to such Lender, submitted
to the Borrower by such Lender in accordance with the foregoing to be, absent
manifest error, final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto,
although the failure to give any such notice shall not release or diminish any
of the Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section
2.10(a) upon the subsequent receipt of such notice), (y) in the case of clause
(iii) above, the Borrower or shall take one of the actions specified in Section
2.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event, within the time period
required by law and (z) in the case of clause (iv) above, Non-Dollar Denominated
Loans denominated in the affected Non-Dollar Currency (exclusive of any such
Non-Dollar Denominated Loans which have theretofore been funded) shall no longer
be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the
Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or notice
pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(i) given by the Borrower with respect to such
Non-Dollar Denominated Loans which have not been incurred shall be deemed
rescinded by the Borrower. Each of the Administrative Agent and each Lender
agrees that if it gives notice to the Borrower of any of the events described in
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above, it shall promptly notify the Borrower
and, in the case of any such Lender, the Administrative Agent, if such event
ceases to exist.

          (b) At any time that any Euro Rate Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), the Borrower may (and
in the case of a Euro Rate Loan affected by the circumstances described in
Section 2.10(a)(iii) shall) either (x) if the affected Euro Rate Loan is then
being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel the respective
Borrowing by giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in
writing) on the same date that the Borrower was notified by the affected Lender
or the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if
the affected Euro Rate Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business
Days' written notice to the Administrative Agent, (A) in the case of a
Eurodollar Loan, require the affected Lender to convert such Eurodollar Loan
into a Base Rate Loan (which conversion, in the case of the circumstance
described in Section 2.10(a)(iii), shall occur no later than the last day of the
Interest Period then applicable to such Eurodollar Loan or such earlier day as
shall be required by applicable law) and (B) in the case of any Euro Rate Loan
(other than a Eurodollar Loan), repay all outstanding Borrowings which include
such affected Euro Rate Loans in full in accordance with the applicable
requirements of Section 5.01; provided that, (i) if the circumstances described
in Section 2.10(a)(iii) apply to any Non-Dollar Denominated Loan, the Borrower,
may, in lieu of taking the actions described above, maintain such Non-Dollar
Denominated Loan outstanding, in which case, (x) in the case of Euro Denominated
Loans, the applicable Euro Rate shall be determined on the basis provided in the
proviso to the definition of Euro LIBOR or (y) in the case of Sterling
Denominated Term Loans, the applicable Euro Rate shall be determined on the
basis provided in the proviso to the definition of Sterling LIBOR, as the case
may be, unless the maintenance of such Non-Dollar Denominated Loan outstanding
on such basis would not stop the conditions described in Section 2.10(a)(iii)
from existing (in which case the actions described above, without giving


                                      -67-

<PAGE>

effect to the proviso, shall be required to be taken) and (ii) if more than one
Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be treated the
same pursuant to this Section 2.10(b).

          (c) If any Lender determines that after the Effective Date the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule,
regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or
administration thereof by the NAIC or any Governmental Authority, central bank
or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's Revolving Loan
Commitments hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to
pay to such Lender, upon its written demand therefor, such additional amounts as
shall be required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the
increased cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the
rate of return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such
increase of capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will
act reasonably and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods
which are reasonable, provided that such Lender's determination of compensation
owing under this Section 2.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and
conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining
in good faith that any additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this
Section 2.10(c), will give prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which
notice shall set forth such Lender's basis for asserting its rights under this
Section 2.10(c) and the calculation, in reasonable detail, of such additional
amounts claimed hereunder, although the failure to give any such notice shall
not release or diminish the Borrower's obligations to pay additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.10(c) upon the subsequent receipt of such notice. A
Lender's good faith determination of compensation owing under this Section
2.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all
the parties hereto.

In the event that any Lender shall in good faith determine (which determination
shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties
hereto) at any time that such Lender is required to maintain reserves
(including, without limitation, any marginal, emergency, supplemental, special
or other reserves required by applicable law) which have been established by any
Federal, state, local or foreign court or governmental agency, authority,
instrumentality or regulatory body with jurisdiction over such Lender (including
any branch, Affiliate or funding office thereof) in respect of any Non-Dollar
Denominated Loans or any category of liabilities which includes deposits by
reference to which the interest rate on any Non-Dollar Denominated Loan is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which
includes loans by a non-United States office of any Lender to non-United States
residents, then, unless such reserves are included in the calculation of the
interest rate applicable to such Non-Dollar Denominated Loans or in Section
2.10(a)(ii), such Lender shall promptly notify Holdings and the Borrower in
writing specifying the additional amounts required to indemnify such Lender
against the cost of maintaining such reserves (such written notice to provide in
reasonable detail a computation of such additional amounts) and the Borrower
shall pay to such Lender such specified amounts as additional interest at the
time that the Borrower is otherwise required to pay interest in respect of such
Non-Dollar Denominated Loan or, if later, on written demand therefor by such
Lender.


                                      -68-

<PAGE>

          2.11. Compensation. The Borrower agrees to compensate each Lender,
upon its written request (which request shall set forth in reasonable detail the
basis for requesting such compensation), for all losses, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss, expense or liability
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but excluding loss of
anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for any reason (other
than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a Borrowing of, or
conversion from or into, Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a date specified
therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation (whether
or not withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed withdrawn pursuant to Section
2.10(a)); (ii) if any prepayment or repayment (including any prepayment or
repayment made pursuant to Section 5.01, Section 5.02 or as a result of an
acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 11) or conversion of any of its
Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the last day of an Interest
Period with respect thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of any of its Eurodollar
Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of prepayment given by the
Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other default by the Borrower to
repay Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of this Agreement or any Note
held by such Lender or (y) any election made pursuant to Section 2.10(b). Each
Lender's calculation of the amount of compensation owing pursuant to this
Section 2.11(a) shall be made in good faith. A Lender's basis for requesting
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11(a) and a Lender's calculation of the
amount thereof, shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and
binding on all parties hereto.

          2.12. Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that on the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 2.10(a)(ii) or
(iii), Section 2.10(c), Section 3.06 or Section 5.04 with respect to such
Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject
to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending
office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, provided that
such designation is made on such terms that such Lender and its lending office
suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of
avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of such
Section. Nothing in this Section 2.12 shall affect or postpone any of the
obligations of Borrower or the right of any Lender provided in Sections 2.10,
3.06 and 5.04.

          2.13. Replacement of Lenders. (x) If any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, (y) upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of
Section 2.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 2.10(c), Section 3.06 or Section 5.04 with
respect to any Lender which results in such Lender charging to the Borrower
increased costs materially in excess of the average costs being charged by the
other Lenders or (z) in the case of a refusal by a Lender to consent to a
proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination with respect to this Agreement
which has been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided
in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right, in accordance with
Section 13.04(b), if no Event of Default then exists or would exist after giving
effect to such replacement, to replace such Lender (the "Replaced Lender") with
one or more other Eligible Transferees, none of whom shall constitute a
Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively, the
"Replacement Lender") and each of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent with identical Revolving Loan Commitments and/or Loans of
the respective Tranche provided by the Replacement Lender; provided that:


                                      -69-

<PAGE>

          (a) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 2.13, the
Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and Assumption
Agreements pursuant to Section 13.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to
said Section 13.04(b) to be paid by the Replacement Lender and/or the Replaced
Lender (as may be agreed to at such time by and among the Borrower, the
Replacement Lender and the Replaced Lender)) pursuant to which the Replacement
Lender shall acquire all of the Revolving Loan Commitments and outstanding Loans
(or, in the case of the replacement of only the Revolving Loan Commitment, the
Revolving Loan Commitment and outstanding Revolving Loans and participations in
Letter of Credit Outstandings) of, and in each case all participations in
Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall
pay to (x) the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of
(A) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all
outstanding Loans of the Replaced Lender with respect to which such Replaced
Lender is being replaced, (B) an amount equal to all Unpaid Drawings (unless
there are no Unpaid Drawings with respect to the Tranche being replaced) that
have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender, together with
all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time and (C) an amount
equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the Replaced Lender
pursuant to Section 4.01, (y) each Issuing Lender an amount equal to such
Replaced Lender's RL Percentage of any Unpaid Drawing relating to Letters of
Credit issued by such Letter of Credit Issuer (which at such time remains an
Unpaid Drawing) to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such
Replaced Lender and (z) in the case of any replacement of Revolving Loan
Commitments, the Swingline Lender an amount equal to such Replaced Lender's RL
Percentage of any Mandatory Borrowing to the extent such amount was not
theretofore funded by such Replaced Lender to the Swingline Lender; and

          (b) all obligations of the Borrower then due and owing to the Replaced
Lender (other than those (a) specifically described in clause (a) above in
respect of which the assignment purchase price has been, or is concurrently
being, paid, but including all amounts, if any, owing under Section 2.11 or (b)
relating to any Loans and/or Revolving Loan Commitments of the respective
Replaced Lender which will remain outstanding after giving effect to the
respective replacement) shall be paid in full to such Replaced Lender
concurrently with such replacement.

Upon receipt by the Replaced Lender of all amounts required to be paid to it
pursuant to this Section 2.13, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled (but
not obligated) and authorized to execute an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
on behalf of such Replaced Lender, and any such Assignment and Assumption
Agreement so executed by the Administrative Agent and the Replacement Lender
shall be effective for purposes of this Section 2.13 and Section 13.04. Upon the
execution of the respective Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the payment of
amounts referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above, recordation of the assignment
on the Register by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.15 and, if so
requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the Replacement Lender of the
appropriate Note or Notes executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall
become a Lender hereunder and, unless the respective Replaced Lender continues
to have outstanding a Revolving Loan Commitment hereunder, the Replaced Lender
shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder, except with respect to
indemnification provisions under this Agreement (including, without limitation,
Sections 2.10,


                                      -70-

<PAGE>

2.11, 3.06, 5.04, 12.06, 13.01 and 13.06), which shall survive as to such
Replaced Lender, the RL Percentages of the Lenders shall be automatically
adjusted at such time to give effect to such replacement.

          2.14. Incremental Commitments. (a) So long as the Incremental
Commitment Request Requirements are satisfied at the time of the delivery of the
request referred to below, the Borrower shall have the right, in consultation
and coordination with, Administrative Agent as to all of the matters set forth
below in this Section 2.14, but without requiring the consent of any of the
Lenders, to request at any time and from time to time after the Initial
Borrowing Date and prior to the date which is three months prior to the
Revolving Loan Maturity Date, that one or more Lenders (and/or one or more other
Persons which are Eligible Transferees and which will become Lenders as provided
below) provide Incremental Commitments, it being understood and agreed, however,
that (i) no Lender shall be obligated to provide an Incremental Commitment as a
result of any such request by the Borrower, and until such time, if any, as such
Lender has agreed in its sole discretion to provide an Incremental Commitment
and executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Commitment
Agreement in respect thereof as provided in clause (b) of this Section 2.14,
such Lender shall not be obligated to fund any Revolving Loans or participate in
Swingline Loans or Letters of Credit in excess of its Commitment as in effect
prior to giving effect to such Incremental Commitment provided pursuant to this
Section 2.14, (ii) any Lender (including any Eligible Transferee who will become
a Lender) may so provide an Incremental Commitment without the consent of any
other Lender, (iii) each provision of Incremental Commitments on a given date
pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall be in a minimum aggregate amount (for all
Lenders (including any Eligible Transferee who will become a lender)) of at
least $10,000,000 and in integral multiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof, and
(iv) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Commitments provided pursuant to
this Section 2.14 shall not exceed the Maximum Incremental Commitment Amount.

          (b) At the time of the provision of Incremental Commitments pursuant
to this Section 2.14, the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each such
Lender or other Eligible Transferee which agrees to provide an Incremental
Commitment (each, an "Incremental Lender") shall execute and deliver to
Administrative Agent an Incremental Commitment Agreement, with the effectiveness
of such Incremental Lender's Incremental Commitment to occur on the date set
forth in such Incremental Commitment Agreement, which date in any event shall be
no earlier than the date on which (w) all fees required to be paid in connection
therewith at the time of such effectiveness shall have been paid (including,
without limitation, any agreed upon up-front or arrangement fees owing to
Administrative Agent (or any affiliate thereof)), (x) all Incremental Commitment
Requirements are satisfied, (y) all other conditions set forth in this Section
2.14 shall have been satisfied, and (z) all other conditions precedent that may
be set forth in such Incremental Commitment Agreement shall have been satisfied.
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness
of each Incremental Commitment Agreement, and at such time, (i) the Total
Commitment under, and for all purposes of, this Agreement shall be increased by
the aggregate amount of such Incremental Commitments, (ii) Appendix A shall be
deemed modified to reflect the revised Revolving Loan Commitments of the
affected Lenders and (iii) to the extent requested by any Incremental Lender,
Revolving Loan Notes will be issued, at the expense of the Borrower, to such
Incremental Lender in conformity with the requirements of Section 2.05.


                                      -71-

<PAGE>

          (c) At the time of any provision of Incremental Commitments pursuant
to this Section 2.14, the Borrower shall, in coordination with Administrative
Agent, repay outstanding Revolving Loans of certain of the Lenders, and incur
additional Revolving Loans from certain other Lenders (including the Incremental
Lenders), in each case to the extent necessary so that all of the Lenders
participate in each outstanding borrowing of Revolving Loans pro rata on the
basis of their respective Revolving Loan Commitments (after giving effect to any
increase in the Total Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.14) and with the
Borrower being obligated to pay to the respective Lenders any costs of the type
referred to in Section 2.10 in connection with any such repayment and/or
incurrence.

          SECTION 3. Letters of Credit.

          3.01. Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, a Borrower may request that an Issuing Lender
issue, at any time and from time to time on and after the Initial Borrowing Date
and prior to the fifth Business Day (or the 30th day in the case of trade
Letters of Credit described in clause (y) below (each a "Trade Letter of
Credit")) prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, for the account of the
Borrower and for the benefit of (x) any holder (or any trustee, agent or other
similar representative for any such holders) of L/C Supportable Obligations, an
irrevocable standby letter of credit, in a form customarily used by such Issuing
Lender or in such other form as is reasonably acceptable to such Issuing Lender,
and (y) sellers of goods to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, an
irrevocable trade letter of credit, in a form customarily used by such Issuing
Lender or in such other form as has been approved by such Issuing Lender (each
such letter of credit, a "Letter of Credit" and, collectively, the "Letters of
Credit"). All Letters of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars, Euros or
Sterling and shall be issued on a sight basis only.

          (b) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
each Issuing Lender agrees that it will, at any time and from time to time on
and after the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the fifth Business Day (or the
30th day in the case of Trade Letter of Credit) prior to the Revolving Loan
Maturity Date, following its receipt of the respective Letter of Credit Request,
issue for account of the Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit in support of
such obligations as are permitted to remain outstanding hereunder without giving
rise to a Default or an Event of Default, provided that no Issuing Lender shall
be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit of the types described
above if at the time of such issuance:

          (i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
     arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain such Issuing
     Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or any requirement of law
     applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or directive (whether or
     not having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with
     jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or request that such
     Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or
     such Letter of Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing
     Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction or reserve or
     capital requirement (for which such Issuing Lender is not otherwise
     compensated hereunder) not in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender on
     the date hereof, or any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not
     applicable or in effect with respect to such Issuing Lender as of the date
     hereof and which such Issuing Lender reasonably and in good faith deems
     material to it; or


                                      -72-

<PAGE>

          (ii) such Issuing Lender shall have received from the respective
     Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders prior to the
     issuance of such Letter of Credit notice of the type described in the
     second sentence of Section 3.03(b).

          (c) Part A of Schedule XIX hereto contains a description of certain
letters of credit issued and outstanding on the Initial Borrowing Date (and
setting forth, with respect to each such letter of credit, (i) the name of the
issuing lender, (ii) the letter of credit number, (iii) the name(s) of the
account party or account parties, (iv) the stated amount (including the currency
in which such letter of credit is denominated, which shall be Dollars or an
Alternative Currency), (v) the name of the beneficiary, (vi) the expiry date and
(vii) whether such letter of credit constitutes a standby letter of credit or a
trade letter of credit). Each such letter of credit, including any extension or
renewal thereof (each, as amended from time to time in accordance with the terms
thereof and hereof, an "Existing Letter of Credit") shall constitute a "Letter
of Credit" for all purposes of this Agreement and issued, for purposes of
Section 3.04(a), on the Initial Borrowing Date. Any Lender hereunder (and any of
such Lender's Affiliates and/or branches) which has issued an Existing Letter of
Credit shall constitute an "Issuing Lender" for all purposes of this Agreement.

          3.02. Maximum Letter of Credit Outstandings; Final Maturities. (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no
Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the
Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid on
the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Letter of Credit) at
such time would exceed either (x) $100,000,000, (y) when added to the sum of (I)
the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans then outstanding and (II)
the aggregate principal amount of all Swingline Loans then outstanding, an
amount equal to the Total Commitment at such time or (z) cause the Aggregate
Exposure to exceed the Borrowing Base at such time (based on the Borrowing Base
Certificate last delivered), and (ii) each Letter of Credit shall by its terms
terminate (x) in the case of standby Letters of Credit, on or before the earlier
of (A) the date which occurs 12 months after the date of the issuance thereof
(although any such standby Letter of Credit may be extendible for successive
periods of up to 12 months, but, in each case, not beyond the fifth Business Day
prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, on terms acceptable to the Issuing
Lender) and (B) five Business Days prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date;
provided that a standby Letter of Credit issued to support obligations under any
Specified Existing Ship Lease may terminate by its terms on or prior to the
earlier to occur of (1) the date which occurs 24 months after the date of the
issuance thereof and (2) the fifth Business Day preceding the Revolving Loan
Maturity Date, and (y) in the case of trade Letters of Credit, on or before the
earlier of (A) the date which occurs 180 days after the date of issuance thereof
and (B) 30 days prior to the Revolving Loan Maturity Date.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no Euro Denominated Letter of
Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which when added to the Euro
Denominated Obligations (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid on the
date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Letter of Credit) would
exceed the Maximum Euro Denominated Loan Amount and (ii) no Sterling Denominated
Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which when added to the
Sterling Denominated Obligations (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid
on the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Letter of Credit)
would exceed the Maximum Sterling Denominated Loan Amount.


                                      -73-

<PAGE>

          3.03. Letter of Credit Requests; Minimum Stated Amount. (a) Whenever
the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account, the
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing Lender
at least three Business Days' (or such shorter period as is acceptable to such
Issuing Lender) written notice thereof (including by way of facsimile) including
without limitation by specifying the Available Currency such Letter of Credit is
to be denominated. Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C, appropriately
completed (each, a "Letter of Credit Request").

          (b) The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be deemed to be
a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Lenders that such Letter of
Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the requirements
of, Section 3.02. Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received notice from
the Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders before it issues a
Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in Section 6 or 7
are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of Credit would
violate Section 3.02, then such Issuing Lender shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit for the
account of the Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual and
customary practices. Upon the issuance of or modification or amendment to any
standby Letter of Credit, each Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such issuance, modification or
amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of
Credit or the respective modification or amendment thereto, as the case may be.
Promptly after receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Participants, in writing, of such issuance, modification or amendment. On the
first Business Day of each week, each Issuing Lender shall furnish the
Administrative Agent with a written (including via facsimile) report of the
daily aggregate outstandings of trade Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender for the immediately preceding week. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that a Lender Default exists
with respect to a Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue any
Letter of Credit unless such Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements
satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Issuing Lender's risk with
respect to the participation in Letters of Credit by the Defaulting Lender or
Lenders, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's or Lenders'
RL Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings.

          (c) The Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit upon issuance shall be
not less than (x) in the case of a Dollar Denominated Letter of Credit,
$250,000, (y) in the case of a Euro Denominated Letter of Credit, E150,000
and (z) in the case of a Sterling Denominated Letter of Credit, L150,000, or in
each case such lesser amount as is reasonably acceptable to the respective
Issuing Lender.

          3.04. Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon the
issuance by an Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender shall
be deemed to have sold and transferred to each Lender, and each such Lender (in
its capacity under this Section 3.04, a "Participant") shall be deemed
irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such Issuing
Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation,
to the extent of such Participant's RL Percentage, in such Letter of Credit,
each drawing or payment made thereunder and the obligations of the Borrower
under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty
pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the Revolving Loan Commitments or RL
Percentages of the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.13 or


                                      -74-

<PAGE>

13.04(b), it is hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of
Credit and Unpaid Drawings relating thereto, there shall be an automatic
adjustment to the participations pursuant to this Section 3.04 to reflect the
new RL Percentages of the assignor and assignee Lender, as the case may be.

          (b) In determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, no
Issuing Lender shall have any obligation relative to the other Lenders other
than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under such Letter of
Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to substantially
comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. Any action
taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing Lender under or in connection with
any Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such Issuing Lender any
resulting liability to the Borrower, any other Credit Party, any Lender or any
other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be taken with gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing Lender (as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable
decision).

          (c) In the event that an Issuing Lender makes any payment under any
Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have reimbursed such
amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section 3.05(a), such Issuing
Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent, which shall promptly
notify each Participant of such failure, and each Participant shall promptly and
unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the amount of such Participant's RL
Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in the currency of the respective Unpaid
Drawing and in same day funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to
12:00 Noon (New York City time) on any Business Day, any Participant required to
fund a payment under a Letter of Credit, such Participant shall make available
to the respective Issuing Lender in Dollars or such other currency, as
applicable, such Participant's RL Percentage of the amount of such payment on
such Business Day in same day funds. If and to the extent such Participant shall
not have so made its RL Percentage of the amount of such payment available to
respective Issuing Lender, such Participant agrees to pay to such Issuing
Lender, forthwith on demand such amount, together with interest thereon, for
each day from such date until the date such amount is paid to such Issuing
Lender at the overnight Federal Funds Rate (or in the case of amounts owed in
Euros, at the Overnight Euro Rate) for the first three days and at the interest
rate applicable to Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans for
each day thereafter. The failure of any Participant to make available to an
Issuing Lender its RL Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit
issued by such Issuing Lender shall not relieve any other Participant of its
obligation hereunder to make available to such Issuing Lender its RL Percentage
of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date required, as specified
above, but no Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Participant to make available to such Issuing Lender such other Participant's RL
Percentage of any such payment.

          (d) Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a reimbursement
obligation as to which it has received any payments from the Participants
pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Lender shall pay to each such
Participant which has paid its RL Percentage thereof, in Dollars (or in Euros or
Sterling in the case of payments to be made in Euros or Sterling pursuant to
Section 3.04(c)) and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Participant's
share (based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such
Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all Participants) of the principal
amount of such


                                      -75-

<PAGE>

reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the purchase of the
respective participations.

          (e) Upon the request of any Participant, each Issuing Lender shall
furnish to such Participant copies of any standby Letter of Credit issued by it
and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such Participant.

          (f) The obligations of the Participants to make payments to each
Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and not
subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
     the other Credit Documents;

          (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right which
     Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time against a
     beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any Letter of
     Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be acting), the
     Administrative Agent, any Participant, or any other Person, whether in
     connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions
     contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying
     transaction between Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings and the
     beneficiary named in any such Letter of Credit);

          (iii) any draft, certificate or any other document presented under any
     Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient
     in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any
     respect;

          (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the performance
     or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit Documents; or

          (v) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

          3.05. Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The Borrower
agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender, by making payment to the Administrative
Agent in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, for any payment or
disbursement made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit issued by it
(each such amount, so paid until reimbursed by the Borrower, an "Unpaid
Drawing"), by making payment in Dollars (in the case of all Dollar Denominated
Letters of Credit), Euros (in the case of Euro Denominated Letters of Credit) or
Sterling (in the case of Sterling Denominated Letters of Credit) not later than
one Business Day following receipt by the Borrower of notice of such payment or
disbursement (provided that no such notice shall be required to be given if a
Default or an Event of Default under Section 11.05 shall have occurred and be
continuing, in which case the Unpaid Drawing shall be due and payable
immediately without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of
which are hereby waived by the Borrower)), with interest on the amount so paid
or disbursed by such Issuing Lender, to the extent not reimbursed prior to 1:00
P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such payment or disbursement, from and
including the date paid or


                                      -76-

<PAGE>

disbursed to but excluding the date such Issuing Lender was reimbursed by the
Borrower therefor at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate as in effect from
time to time plus the Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time for
Revolving Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans; provided, however, to
the extent such amounts are not reimbursed prior to 1:00 P.M. (New York time) on
the third Business Day following notice to the Borrower by the Administrative
Agent or the respective Issuing Lender of such payment or disbursement, interest
shall thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Issuing
Lender (and until reimbursed by the respective Account Party) at a rate per
annum which shall be (x) in the case of Dollar Denominated Letters of Credit,
Sterling Denominated Letters of Credit, the Base Rate in effect from time to
time plus the Applicable Margin for Revolving Loans in each case maintained as
Base Rate Loans, as in effect from time to time plus 2% and (y) in the case of
Euro Denominated Letters of Credit, the Overnight Euro Rate in effect from time
to time plus the Applicable Margin for Euro Denominated Loans as in effect from
time to time plus any Mandatory Costs plus 2%, in each such case, with interest
to be payable on demand, provided further, that it is understood and agreed,
however, that the notices referred to above in this clause (a) and in the
immediately preceding proviso shall not be required to be given if a Default or
an Event of Default under Section 11.05 shall have occurred and be continuing
(in which case the Unpaid Drawings shall be due and payable immediately without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind (all of which are hereby
waived by each Credit Party) and shall bear interest at the rate provided in the
foregoing proviso on and after the third Business Day following the respective
Drawing). The respective Issuing Lender shall give the Borrower prompt notice of
each Drawing under any Letter of Credit, provided that the failure to give, or
any delay in giving, any such notice shall in no way affect, impair or diminish
the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement.

          (b) The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 3.05 to
reimburse each Issuing Lender with respect to drafts, demands and other
presentations for payment under Letters of Credit issued by it (each, a
"Drawing") (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which Holdings or any Subsidiary of Holdings
may have or have had against any Lender (including in its capacity as an Issuing
Lender or as a Participant), including, without limitation, any defense based
upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to conform to the terms
of the Letter of Credit or any nonapplication or misapplication by the
beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided, however, that the
Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse any Issuing Lender for any wrongful
payment made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit issued by it as a
result of acts or omissions constituting willful misconduct or gross negligence
on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          3.06. Increased Costs. If at any time after the Effective Date, the
introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule, regulation, order,
guideline or request or in the interpretation or administration thereof by the
NAIC or any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or any Participant
with any request or directive by the NAIC or by any such Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), shall either (i) impose, modify or
make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement
against letters of credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participated in by any
Participant, or (ii) impose on any Issuing Lender or any


                                      -77-

<PAGE>

Participant any other conditions relating, directly or indirectly, to this
Agreement or any Letter of Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to
increase the cost to any Issuing Lender or any Participant of issuing,
maintaining or participating in any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of
any sum received or receivable by any Issuing Lender or any Participant
hereunder or reduce the rate of return on its capital with respect to Letters of
Credit (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or determined by reference to,
the net income or net profits of such Issuing Lender or such Participant
pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or in which
its principal office or applicable lending office is located or any subdivision
thereof or therein), then, upon the delivery of the certificate referred to
below to the Borrower by any Issuing Lender or any Participant (a copy of which
certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees to pay to such Issuing Lender or such
Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Issuing
Lender or such Participant for such increased cost or reduction in the amount
receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its capital. Any Issuing Lender
or any Participant, upon determining that any additional amounts will be payable
to it pursuant to this Section 3.06, will give prompt written notice thereof to
the Borrower, which notice shall include a certificate submitted to the Borrower
by such Issuing Lender or such Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be
sent by such Issuing Lender or such Participant to the Administrative Agent),
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for the calculation of such
additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Issuing Lender or such
Participant. The certificate required to be delivered pursuant to this Section
3.06 shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the
Borrower.

          SECTION 4. Commitment Commission; Fees; Reductions of Commitment.

          4.01. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
for distribution to each Non-Defaulting Lender a commitment commission (the
"Commitment Commission") for the period from and including the Effective Date to
and including the Revolving Loan Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which
the Total Commitment has been terminated) computed at a rate per annum equal to
the Applicable Commitment Commission Percentage of the Unutilized Revolving Loan
Commitment of such Non-Defaulting Lender as in effect from time to time. Accrued
Commitment Commission shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date and on the date upon which the Total Commitment is
terminated.

          (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to each Lender (based on each such Lender's respective RL
Percentage) a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the "Letter of Credit
Fee") for the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of such Letter of
Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin as in effect
from time to time during such period with respect to Revolving Loans that are
maintained as Eurodollar Loans on the daily Stated Amount of each such Letter of
Credit. Accrued Letter of Credit Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the first day on or after the
termination of the Total Commitment upon which no Letters of Credit remain
outstanding.

          (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own
account, a facing fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it (the
"Facing Fee") for the period from


                                      -78-

<PAGE>

and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the
date of termination or expiration of such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate
per annum equal to 1/8 of 1% on the daily Stated Amount of such Letter of
Credit, provided that in any event the minimum amount of Facing Fees payable in
any twelve-month period for each Letter of Credit shall be not less than $500,
it being agreed that, on the day of issuance of any Letter of Credit and on each
anniversary thereof prior to the termination or expiration of such Letter of
Credit, if $500 will exceed the amount of Facing Fees that will accrue with
respect to such Letter of Credit for the immediately succeeding twelve-month
period, the full $500 shall be payable on the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit and on each such anniversary thereof. Except as otherwise provided in the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, accrued Facing Fees shall be due
and payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and upon the
first day on or after the termination of the Total Commitment upon which no
Letters of Credit remain outstanding.

          (d) The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for its own
account, upon each payment under, issuance of, or amendment to, any Letter of
Credit issued by it, such amount as shall at the time of such event be the
administrative charge and the reasonable expenses which such Issuing Lender is
generally imposing in connection with such occurrence with respect to letters of
credit.

          (e) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such fees
as may be agreed to in writing from time to time by Holdings or any of its

the Total Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment in whole, or reduce it in part,
pursuant to this Section 4.02(a), in an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in the
case of partial reductions to the Total Unutilized Revolving Loan Commitment,
provided that each such reduction shall apply proportionately to permanently
reduce the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender.

          (b) In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to certain
proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this
Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right, subject
to obtaining the consents required by Section 13.12(b), upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which

to terminate the entire Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender, so long as all
Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and all other amounts,
owing to such Lender (including all amounts, if any, owing pursuant to Section
2.11 are repaid concurrently with the effectiveness of such termination (at
which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect such changed amounts)
and such Lender's RL Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit is cash
collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
respective Issuing Lenders, and at such time, such Lender shall no longer
constitute a "Lender" for purposes of this

(including, without limitation, Sections 2.10, 2.11, 3.06, 5.04, 12.06, 13.01

(and the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its
entirety on April 30, 2006, unless the Initial Borrowing Date has occurred on or
prior to such date.

          (b) In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions pursuant
to this Section 4.03, the Total Commitment shall terminate in its entirety upon
the earlier of (i) the Revolving Loan Maturity Date and (ii) unless the Required
Lenders otherwise agree in writing, the date on which a Change of Control
occurs.

          (c) Each reduction to, or termination of, the Total Commitment
pursuant to this Section 4.03 shall be applied to proportionately reduce or
terminate, as the case may be, the Revolving Loan Commitment of each Lender with
a Revolving Loan Commitment.

          SECTION 5. Prepayments; Payments; Taxes.

          5.01. Voluntary Prepayments. (a) The Borrower shall have the right to

Swingline Loans pursuant to this Section 5.01(a) shall be in an aggregate

to the Administrative Agent in any given case), provided that if any partial
prepayment of Euro Rate Loans made pursuant to any Borrowing shall reduce the
outstanding principal amount of Euro Rate Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing
to an amount less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, then
such Borrowing may not be continued as a Borrowing of Euro Rate Loans (and same

election of an Interest Period with respect thereto given by the Borrower or
Borrower shall have no force or effect; (iii) each prepayment pursuant to this
Section 5.01(a) in respect of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be
applied pro rata among such Loans, provided that at the Borrower's election in
connection with any prepayment of Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section

          (b) In the event of certain refusals by a Lender to consent to certain

Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, upon three Business
Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office
(which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the
Lenders), repay all Loans of such Lender (including all amounts, if any, owing
pursuant to Section 2.11), together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees and
all other amounts then owing to such Lender in accordance with, and subject to
the requirements of, said Section 13.12(b), so long as (A) in the case of the
repayment of Revolving Loans of any Lender pursuant to this clause (b), (x) the
Revolving Loan Commitment of such Lender is terminated concurrently with such
repayment pursuant to Section 4.02(b) (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed
modified to reflect the changed Revolving Loan Commitments) and (y) such
Lender's RL Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit is cash
collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
respective Issuing Lenders and (B) the consents, if any, required by Section

          5.02. Mandatory Repayments and Commitment Reductions. (a) (i) On any
day on which the (other than during an Agent Advance Period) Aggregate Exposure
exceeds the lesser of (x) the Total Commitment at such time and (y) the
Borrowing Base at such time (based on the Borrowing Base Certificate last
delivered), the Borrower shall prepay on such day the principal of Swingline
Loans and, after all Swingline Loans have been repaid in full or if no Swingline
Loans are outstanding, Revolving Loans in an amount equal to such excess. If,
after giving effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Swingline Loans and
Revolving Loans, the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Outstandings
exceeds the lesser of (A) the Total Commitment at such time, and (B) the
Borrowing Base at such time (based on the Borrowing Base Certificate (as

of such excess (up to a maximum amount equal to the Letter of Credit
Outstandings at such time), such cash and/or Cash Equivalents to be held as
security for all Obligations of the Borrower to the Issuing Lenders and the
Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral account to be established by the
Administrative Agent.

          (ii) On any day on which the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Euro Denominated Obligations exceeds the
Maximum Euro Denominated Loan Amount, the Borrower shall prepay on such day the
principal of outstanding Euro Denominated Loans in an amount (taking the Dollar
Equivalent of the amounts paid in the respective currency in which payments on
such Euro Denominated Loans are owing) equal to such excess. If, after giving
effect to the prepayment of all outstanding Euro Denominated Loans, the

          (iii) On any day on which the Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of all Sterling Denominated Loans exceeds the
Maximum Sterling Denominated Loan Amount, the Borrower shall prepay on such day
the principal of outstanding Sterling Denominated Loans in an amount (taking the

Loans, the aggregate amount of the Letter of Credit Outstandings of Sterling
Letters of Credit exceeds the Maximum Sterling Denominated Loan Amount, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office on such day
an amount of cash and/or Cash Equivalents equal to the amount of such excess (up
to a maximum amount equal to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time),
such cash and/or Cash Equivalents to be held as security for all Obligations of
the Borrower to the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder in a cash
collateral account to be established by the Administrative Agent.

          (b) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 5.02, on each date upon which Holdings or any of the its Subsidiaries
receives Net Sale Proceeds from any Asset Sale (other than the California
Disposition, to the extent the Net Sale Proceeds therefrom received by a
Subsidiary of the Borrower (exclusive of any portion thereof which is
distributed to a minority shareholder of such Subsidiary in accordance with the
requirements of Section 10.06) are promptly on-loaned to an Affiliate of the
Borrower in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.05 and 10.07), an
amount equal to 100% of the Net Sale Proceeds from such Asset Sale shall be
applied as a mandatory repayment and/or commitment reduction in accordance with
the requirements of Section 5.02(f); provided that (I) Net Sale Proceeds from
any Asset Sale (other than (x) Net Sale Proceeds from any Contemplated Asset
Sale consummated in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.02(xviii),
(y) any Net Sale Proceeds from the sale of any Principal Property pursuant to
Section 10.02(xix) and (z) Net Sale Proceeds from the sale or other disposition
of the Equity Interests of the Unrestricted Wellbeing Joint Venture pledged
pursuant to the Pledge Agreement) shall not give rise to a mandatory repayment
and/or commitment reduction on such date as otherwise required above, so long as
no Specified Default and no Event of Default exists at the time such Net Sale
Proceeds are received and an Authorized Officer of Holdings or the Borrower has
delivered a certificate to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such date
stating that such Net Sale Proceeds shall be used (or contractually committed to
be used) to purchase capital assets used or to be used in a Permitted Business
(other than inventory) within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net
Sale Proceeds from such Asset Sale (which certificate shall set forth (in
reasonable detail) the estimates of the proceeds to be so expended) and (II) Net
Sale Proceeds from one (but not more than one) sale of a Principal Property
consummated after the Effective Date in reliance on Section 10.02(xix) and
notified in writing to the Administrative Agent shall not give rise to a
mandatory repayment and/or commitment reduction on such date as otherwise
required above, so long as no Specified Default and no Event of Default exists
at the time such Net Sale Proceeds are received and an Authorized Officer of
Holdings or the Borrower has delivered a certificate to the Administrative Agent
on or prior to such date stating that such Net Sale Proceeds shall be used (or
contractually committed to be used) to purchase, construct and/or make
investments in a new Principal Property (or assets and properties that upon
completion of such purchase, construction and/or investments will become a
Principal Property) within 360 days following the date of receipt of such Net
Sale Proceeds from such sale of such Principal Property (which certificate shall
set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be so


                                      -82-

<PAGE>

expended); provided, however, that (I) if all or any portion of such Net Sale
Proceeds are not so used within such 360-day period (or contractually committed
within such period to be used), such remaining portion shall be applied on the
last day of such period as a mandatory repayment as provided above (without
giving effect to the immediately preceding proviso) and (II) if all or any
portion of such Net Sale Proceeds are not required to be applied on the last day
of such 360-day period referred to in clause (I) of this proviso because such
amount is contractually committed within such period to be used and then either
(A) subsequent to such date such contract is terminated or expires without such
portion being so used or (B) such contractually committed portion is not so used
within six months after the last day of such 360-day period referred to in
clause (I) of this proviso, such remaining portion, in the case of either of the
preceding clauses (A) or (B), shall be applied as a mandatory repayment as
provided above (without giving effect to the immediately preceding proviso).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.02(b), (x)
if any Permitted Senior Notes Document (after the execution and delivery
thereof), any Permitted Refinancing Senior Notes Document (after the execution
and delivery thereof), the Intermediate Holdings Credit Documents or the
Existing Senior Notes Documents permit a lesser amount to be retained or
reinvested, or have a shorter reinvestment period, than is provided above with
respect to any Asset Sales, then such lesser permitted retained or reinvestment
amount, and/or shorter reinvestment period, as the case may be, shall be
applicable for purposes of this Section 5.02(b) so long as such Permitted Senior
Notes, Permitted Refinancing Senior Notes, Intermediate Holdco Indebtedness or
Existing Senior Notes, as the case may be, remain outstanding, and (y) in no
event shall Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries use any proceeds from any Asset
Sale to make any voluntary or mandatory repayment or prepayment of Permitted
Senior Notes, Permitted Refinancing Senior Notes, Holdings Senior Notes,
Intermediate Holdco Indebtedness or Existing Senior Notes and, before any such
obligation to use such proceeds to make such repayment shall arise, Holdings or
the respective Subsidiary shall reinvest the respective amounts as permitted
above in this Section 5.02(b) or apply such proceeds as a mandatory prepayment
in accordance with requirements of Section 5.02(f).

          (c) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 5.02, on each date on or after the Initial Borrowing Date on which
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries receives any cash proceeds from any
incurrence of Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness permitted to be incurred
pursuant to Section 10.04 as in effect on the Initial Borrowing Date), an amount
equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds of the respective incurrence of
Indebtedness shall be applied as a mandatory repayment in accordance with the
requirements of Section 5.02(f).

          (d) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 5.02, within 10 days following each date on or after the Initial
Borrowing Date on which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries receives any
proceeds from any Recovery Event (other than proceeds from Recovery Events in an
amount less than $5,000,000 per Recovery Event), an amount equal to 100% of the
proceeds of such Recovery Event (net of reasonable costs (including, without
limitation, legal costs and expenses) and taxes incurred in connection with such
Recovery Event and the amount of such proceeds required to be used to repay any
Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness of the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement)
which is secured by the respective assets subject to such Recovery Event) shall
be applied as a mandatory repayment and/or commitment reduction in accordance
with the requirements of Section 5.02(f);


                                      -83-

<PAGE>

provided that so long as no Specified Default and no Event of Default then
exists, such proceeds shall not be required to be so applied on such date to the
extent that an Authorized Officer of Holdings or the Borrower has delivered a
certificate to the Administrative Agent on or prior to such date stating that
such proceeds shall be used (or contractually committed to be used) within 360
days following the date of receipt of such proceeds from such Recovery Event to
replace or restore any properties or assets in respect of which such proceeds
were paid (which certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be
so expended), and provided further, that (I) if all or any portion of such
proceeds are not so used (or contractually committed to be used) within such
360-day period, such remaining portion shall be applied as a mandatory repayment
and/or commitment reduction as provided above (without giving effect to the
immediately preceding proviso) and (II) if all or any portion of such proceeds
are not required to be applied on the last day of such 360-day period referred
to in clause (I) of this proviso because such amount is contractually committed
to be used and then either (A) subsequent to such date such contract is
terminated or expires without such portion being so used or (B) such
contractually committed portion is not so used within six months after the last
day of such 360-day period referred to in clause (I) of this proviso, such
remaining portion, in the case of either of the preceding clauses (A) or (B),
shall be applied as a mandatory repayment and/or commitment reduction as
provided above (without giving effect to the immediately preceding proviso).

          (e) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 5.02, on each Excess Cash Payment Date, an amount equal to the remainder
(if positive) of (x) the Applicable Prepayment Percentage of the Excess Cash
Flow for the relevant Excess Cash Flow Payment Period minus (y) the aggregate
amount of principal repayments of Term Loans (and Original Loans to the extent
(and only to the extent) that such repayments were made with internally
generated funds as a voluntary prepayment pursuant to Section 4.01 of the Term
Credit Agreement (or the Original Credit Agreement, as applicable) during the
relevant Excess Cash Flow Payment Period, shall be applied as a mandatory
repayment and/or commitment reduction in accordance with the requirements of
Section 5.02(f).

          (f) Each amount required to be applied pursuant to Sections 5.02(b),
(c), (d), and (e) in accordance with this Section 5.02(f) shall be applied
first, to repay outstanding Term Loans under the Term Credit Agreement to the
extent required thereunder, second, to cash collateralize the Pre-Funded L/Cs,
third to repay Swingline Loans, and fourth to repay Revolving Loans in each case
without any reduction in the Revolving Loan Commitment.

          (g) With respect to each repayment of Loans required by this Section
5.02, the Borrower may designate the Types of Loans of the respective Tranche
which are to be repaid and, in the case of Euro Rate Loans, the specific
Borrowing or Borrowings of the respective Tranche pursuant to which such
Eurodollar Loans were made, provided that: (i) repayments of Euro Rate Loans
pursuant to this Section 5.02 may only be made on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto unless all Euro Rate Loans of the respective Tranche
with Interest Periods ending on such date of required repayment and all Base
Rate Loans of the respective Tranche have been paid in full; (ii) if any
repayment of Euro Rate Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce
the outstanding Euro Rate Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount
less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, such Borrowing shall
be automatically converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; and (iii) each
repayment of any Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro rata
among such


                                      -84-

<PAGE>

Loans. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as described in the
preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the above, make
such designation in its sole discretion.

          (h) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 5.02, (i) all then outstanding Loans of a respective Tranche shall be
repaid in full on the respective Maturity Date for such Tranche of Loans, and
(ii) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree in writing, all then
outstanding Loans shall be repaid in full on the date on which a Change of
Control occurs.

          (i) In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant to this
Section 5.02, each Swingline Loan will be repaid (for the avoidance of doubt,
such repayment may be made with proceeds from Revolving Loans) no later than the
seventh day following the incurrence thereof; provided that, if the seventh day
is not a Business Day, the next Business Day.

          5.03. Method and Place of Payment; Payments and Computations;
Maintenance of Accounts; Statement of Accounts. (a) Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement and under any
Note shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lender or
Lenders entitled thereto not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date
when due and shall be made (x) in Dollars in immediately available funds at the
Payment Office of the Administrative Agent in respect of any obligation of the
Borrower under this Agreement except as otherwise provided in the immediately
following clauses (y) and (z), (y) Euros in immediately available funds at the
Payment Office of the Administrative Agent, if such payment is made in respect
of principal of or interest on Euro Denominated Loans and (z) Sterling in
immediately available funds at the Payment Office of the Administrative Agent,
if such payment is made in respect of principal of or interest on Sterling
Denominated Loans. Nothing in the succeeding clauses of this Section 5.03 shall
affect or alter the Borrower's obligations to the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders with respect to all
payments otherwise required to be made by the Borrower in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents. Whenever any payment to
be made hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is
not a Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, with respect to payments of principal, interest
shall be payable at the applicable rate during such extension.

          (b) Each of the Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries shall, along
with the Collateral Agent and certain financial institutions selected by the
Borrower and acceptable to the Administrative Agent (the "Collection Banks"),
enter into on or prior to the Effective Date (or such later date as provided in
Section 13.19) and thereafter maintain separate Cash Management Control
Agreements. The Borrower and each of its Domestic Subsidiaries shall instruct
all Account Debtors of the Borrower and such Domestic Subsidiaries to remit all
payments to the applicable "P.O. Boxes" or "Lockbox Addresses" of the applicable
Collection Bank with respect to all Accounts of such Account Debtor, which
remittances shall be collected by the applicable Collection Bank and deposited
in the applicable Collection Account. All amounts received by the Borrower, any
of its Domestic Subsidiaries and any Collection Bank in respect of any Account,
in addition to all other cash received from any other source, shall upon receipt
be deposited into a Collection Account or directly into the Core Concentration
Account.


                                      -85-

<PAGE>

          (c) The Borrower and its respective Domestic Subsidiaries shall, along
with the Collateral Agent and each of those banks in which the Deposit Accounts
(other than Excluded Deposit Accounts but including all Collection Accounts and
the Core Concentration Account) are maintained, enter into on or prior to the
Effective Date (or such later date as provided in Section 13.19) and thereafter
maintain separate Cash Management Control Agreements.

          (d) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Cash
Management Control Agreements, all collected amounts held in all of the
Collection Accounts, with respect to the Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries
shall be wired by the close of business on each Business Day into an account
(the "Core Concentration Account"). Except as, and to the extent, all of the
Collection Accounts shall be "zero" balance accounts. So long as no Event of
Default or Compliance Period then exists, the Borrower and its Domestic
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to transfer cash from the Core Concentration
Account to the Excluded Deposit Accounts to be used for working capital and
general corporate purposes, all subject to the requirements of this Section
5.03(d) and pursuant to procedures and arrangements to be determined by the
Administrative Agent. If an Event of Default or Compliance Period exists, all
collected amounts held in the Core Concentration Account shall be applied as
provided in Section 5.03(e).

          (e) During the continuance of a Compliance Period, all collected
amounts held in the Core Concentration Account shall be distributed and applied
on a daily basis in the following order (in each case, to the extent the
Administrative Agent has actual knowledge of the amounts owing or outstanding as
described below and any applications otherwise described in following clauses
(x) and (y), and after giving effect to the application of any such amounts (x)
otherwise required to be applied pursuant to Sections 5.02(b), (c), (d), (e),
(f) or (g) or (y) constituting proceeds from any Collateral otherwise required
to be applied pursuant to the terms of the respective Security Document): (1)
first, to the payment (on a ratable basis) of any outstanding Expenses actually
due and payable to the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent under
any of the Credit Documents and to repay or prepay outstanding Swingline Loans
and Revolving Loans advanced by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders pursuant to Sections 2.01(e) and 2.04(b); (2) second, to the extent all

Drawings and all interest thereon; (3) third, to the extent all amounts referred
to in preceding clauses (1) and (2) have been paid in full, to pay (on a ratable
basis) all accrued and unpaid interest actually due and payable on the Revolving
Loans and all accrued and unpaid Fees actually due and payable to the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders under any of the
Credit Documents; (4) fourth, to the extent all amounts referred to in preceding
clauses (1) through (3), inclusive, have been paid in full, to repay (on a
ratable basis) the outstanding principal of Revolving Loans (whether or not then
due and payable), and (5) fifth, to the extent all amounts referred to in
preceding clauses (1) through (4), inclusive, have been paid in full, to pay (on
a ratable basis) all other outstanding Obligations then due and payable to the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Lenders under any of the
Credit Documents.

          (f) Without limiting the provisions set forth in Section 13.15, the
Administrative Agent shall maintain an account on its books in the name of the
Borrower


                                      -86-

<PAGE>

(collectively, the "Credit Account") in which the Borrower will be charged with
all loans and advances made by the Lenders to the Borrower for the Borrower's
account, including the Loans, the Letter of Credit Outstandings, and the Fees,
Expenses and any other Obligations relating thereto. The Borrower will be
credited, in accordance with this Section 5.03, with all amounts received by the
Lenders from the Borrower or from others for its account, including, as set
forth above, all amounts received by the Administrative Agent and applied to the
Obligations. In no event shall prior recourse to any Accounts or other
Collateral be a prerequisite to the Administrative Agent's right to demand
payment of any Obligation upon its maturity. Further, the Administrative Agent
shall have no obligation whatsoever to perform in any respect any of the
Borrower's or any of its Subsidiaries' contracts or obligations relating to the
Accounts.

          (g) After the end of each month, the Administrative Agent shall send
the Borrower and each Lender a statement accounting for the charges, loans,

          5.04. Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrower hereunder
and under any Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or other defense.

clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of whatever nature
now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political sub-division or
taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments (but
excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax imposed
on or measured by the net income or net profits of a Lender pursuant to the laws
of the jurisdiction in which it is organized or the jurisdiction in which the
principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located or any
subdivision thereof or therein) and all interest, penalties or similar
liabilities with respect to such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
fees, assessments or other charges (all such non-excluded taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges being referred to
collectively as "Taxes"). If any Taxes are so levied or imposed, the Borrower
agrees to pay the full amount of such Taxes, and such additional amounts as may
be necessary so that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement or
under any Note, after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes,
will not be less than the amount provided for herein or in such Note. If any
amounts are payable in respect of Taxes pursuant to the preceding sentence, the
Borrower agrees to reimburse each Lender, upon the written request of such
Lender, for taxes imposed on or measured by the net income or net profits of
such Lender pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Lender is
organized or in which the principal office or applicable lending office of such
Lender is located or under the laws of any political subdivision or taxing
authority of any such jurisdiction in which such Lender is organized or in which
the principal office or applicable lending office of such Lender is located and
for any withholding of taxes as such Lender shall determine are payable by, or
withheld from, such Lender, in respect of such amounts so paid to or on behalf
of such Lender pursuant to the preceding sentence and in respect of any amounts
paid to or on behalf of such Lender pursuant to this sentence. The Borrower will
furnish to the Administrative Agent within 45 days after the date the payment of
any Taxes is due pursuant to applicable law certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing such payment by the Borrower. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and
hold


                                      -87-

harmless each Lender, and reimburse such Lender upon its written request, for
the amount of any Taxes so levied or imposed and paid by such Lender.

          (b) Each Lender that is not a United States person (as such term is
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes
agrees to deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the Effective Date or, in the case of a Lender that is an assignee or transferee
of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 2.13 or 13.04(b) (unless
the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder immediately prior to such
assignment or transfer), on the date of such assignment or transfer to such
Lender, (i) two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under
an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States
withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and
under any Note, or (ii) if the Lender is not a "bank" within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot deliver either Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under
an income tax treaty) (or any successor forms) pursuant to clause (i) above, (x)
a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit D (any such certificate, a
"Section 5.04(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y) two accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (with respect to the
portfolio interest exemption) (or successor form) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States
withholding tax with respect to payments of interest to be made under this
Agreement and under any Note. In addition, each Lender agrees that from time to
time after the Effective Date, when a lapse in time or change in circumstances
renders the previous certification obsolete or inaccurate in any material
respect, such Lender will deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
two new accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8ECI, Form W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax
treaty), or Form W-8BEN (with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a
Section 5.04(b)(ii) Certificate, as the case may be, and such other forms as may
be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender to a
continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with
respect to payments under this Agreement and any Note, or such Lender shall
immediately notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to
deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be
required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section
5.04(b). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.04(a),
but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the
Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent it is required to do so by law, to
deduct or withhold income or similar taxes imposed by the United States (or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein) from interest,
Fees or other amounts payable hereunder for the account of any Lender which is
not a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes to the extent that such Lender
has not provided to the Borrower U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms that
establish a complete exemption from such deduction or withholding and (y) the
Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to Section 5.04(a) to gross-up payments
to be made to a Lender in respect of income or similar taxes imposed by the
United States if (I) such Lender has not provided to the Borrower the Internal
Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 5.04(b) or (II) in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a
Lender described in clause (ii) above, to the extent that such forms do not
establish a complete exemption from withholding of such taxes.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or
elsewhere in this Section 5.04 and except as set forth in Section 13.04(b), the
Borrower agrees to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in
the manner set forth in Section 5.04(a) (without regard to the identity of the
jurisdiction requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts
deducted or withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as
a result of any changes that are effective after the Effective Date in any
applicable law, treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in
the interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of such

          In determining the satisfaction of the conditions specified in this
Section 6, (x) to the extent any item is required to be satisfactory to any
Lender, such item shall be deemed satisfactory to each Lender which has not
notified the Administrative Agent in writing prior to the occurrence of the
Initial Borrowing Date that the respective item or matter does not meet its
satisfaction and (y) in determining whether any Lender is aware of any fact,
condition or event that has occurred and which would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect of the type
described in Section 6.07, each Lender which has not notified the Administrative
Agent in writing prior to the occurrence of the Initial Borrowing Date of such
fact, condition or event shall be deemed not to be aware of any such fact,
condition or event on the Initial Borrowing Date. Upon the Administrative
Agent's good faith determination that the conditions specified in this Section 6
have been met (after giving effect to the preceding sentence), then the Initial
Borrowing Date shall have been deemed to have occurred, regardless of any
subsequent determination that one or more of the conditions thereto had not been
met (although the occurrence of the Initial Borrowing Date shall not release
Holdings or the Borrower from any liability for failure to satisfy one or more
of the applicable conditions contained in this Section 6).

          SECTION 7. Conditions Precedent to All Credit Events.

          The obligation of each Lender to make Loans (including Loans made on
the Initial Borrowing Date), and the obligation of each Issuing Lender to issue

Credit deemed issued, on the Initial Borrowing Date), is subject, at the time of
each such Credit Event (except as hereinafter indicated), to the satisfaction of
the following conditions:

Cash owned or held by the Borrower and its Domestic Subsidiaries (determined
after giving pro forma effect to the making of each such Revolving Loan and/or
Swingline Loan and the application of proceeds therefrom and from any other
Unrestricted Cash on hand (to the extent such proceeds and/or other Unrestricted
Cash are actually utilized by the Borrower and/or any other Subsidiary of
Holdings on the date of the incurrence of the respective such Revolving Loan
and/or Swingline Loan for a permitted purpose under this Agreement other than an
investment in Cash Equivalents)) shall not exceed $25,000,000 for more than five
consecutive Business Days (for purposes of Unrestricted Cash denominated in a
currency other than Dollars, taking the Dollar Equivalent of such Unrestricted
Cash as determined on the date of the incurrence of the respective such
Revolving Loan and/or Swingline Loan).

          7.02. No Default; Representations and Warranties. At the time of each
such Credit Event and also after giving effect thereto (i) there shall exist no
Default or Event of Default and (ii) all representations and warranties
contained herein and in the other Credit Documents shall be true and correct in
all material respects with the same effect as though such representations and
warranties had been made on the date of such Credit Event (it being understood
and agreed that any representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of
a specified date shall be required to be true and correct in all material
respects only as of such specified date).

making of each Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender shall have received the
notice referred to in Section 2.03(b)(i).

          (b) Prior to the issuance of each Letter of Credit (other than the
Existing Letters of Credit), the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing
Lender shall have received a Letter of Credit Request meeting the requirements
of Section 3.03(a).

          The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event shall constitute a
representation and warranty by each Credit Agreement Party to the Administrative
Agent and each of the Lenders that all the conditions specified in Section 6
(with respect to Credit Events on the Initial Borrowing Date) and in this
Section 7 (with respect to Credit Events on or after the Initial Borrowing Date)
and applicable to such Credit Event are satisfied as of that time. All of the
Notes, certificates, legal opinions and other documents and papers referred to
in Section 6 and in this Section 7, unless otherwise specified, shall be
delivered to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office for the account of
each of the Lenders and, except for the Notes, in sufficient counterparts or
copies for each of the Lenders and shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders.

          SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements.

          In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement, to make
(and/or continue) the Loans and issue and/or participate in the Letters of
Credit as provided for herein, each Credit Agreement Party makes the following
representations, warranties and agreements with the Lenders, in each case after
giving effect to the Transaction, all of which shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the making of the Loans and the issuance (or deemed
issuance) of the Letters of Credit a (with the occurrence of the Effective Date
and each Credit Event on or after the Effective Date being deemed to constitute
a representation and warranty that the matters specified in this Section 8 are
true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Effective Date and on
and as of the date of each such Credit Event, unless stated to relate to a
specific earlier date in which case such representations and warranties shall be
true and correct in all material respects as of such earlier date):

          8.01. Company Status. Each of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries
(i) is a duly organized and validly existing Company in good standing (or its
equivalent) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has the
Company power and authority to own its property and assets and to transact the
business in which it is engaged and presently proposes to engage and (iii) is
duly qualified and is authorized to do business and is in good standing (or its
equivalent) in all jurisdictions where it is required to be so qualified (or its
equivalent) and where the failure to be so qualified has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

          8.02. Company Power and Authority. Each Credit Party and each
Subsidiary thereof has the Company power and authority to execute, deliver and
carry out the terms and provisions of the Documents to which it is a party and
has taken all necessary Company action to


                                      -98-

<PAGE>

authorize the execution, delivery and performance of the Documents to which it
is a party. Each Credit Party and each Subsidiary thereof has duly executed and
delivered each Document to which it is a party and each such Document
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Credit Party
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the
enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws generally affecting creditors' rights
and by equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in
equity or at law).

          8.03. No Violation. (a) Neither the execution, delivery or performance
by any Credit Party or any Subsidiary thereof of the Documents to which it is a
party, nor compliance by any Credit Party or any such Subsidiary with the terms
and provisions thereof, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein or therein, (i) will contravene any material provision of any applicable
law, statute, rule or regulation, or any order, writ, injunction or decree of
any court or governmental instrumentality, (ii) will conflict or be inconsistent
with or result in any breach of, any of the terms, covenants, conditions or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, or (other than pursuant to the
Security Documents) result in the creation or imposition of (or the obligation
to create or impose) any Lien upon any of the material property or assets of
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, credit agreement or any other material
agreement, contract or instrument to which Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or by which it or any of its material property or assets are bound or
to which it may be subject (including, without limitation, the Existing Senior
Notes Documents, the Intermediate Holdco Senior Notes Indenture, the other
Existing Indebtedness Agreements, and, on and after the execution and delivery
thereof, the Holdings Senior Notes Indenture, any Wellbeing Project Financing
Document, any Permitted Senior Notes Indenture and any Permitted Refinancing
Senior Notes Document) or (iii) will violate any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, by-laws, certificate of partnership, partnership agreement,
certificate of limited liability company, limited liability company agreement or
equivalent organizational document, as the case may be, of Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries.

          (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing in Section
8.03(a):

          (i) this Agreement, together with the Term Credit Agreement,
     constitute (individually and collectively) the "Credit Agreement" under,
     and as defined in, each Existing Senior Notes Indenture;

          (ii) the incurrence by the Borrower of the Loans and other
     Indebtedness hereunder under on the Initial Borrowing Date and on the date
     of each subsequent Credit Event will not violate any of (I) Section 1014 of
     the Existing 2009 Senior Notes Indenture or any other provision thereof,
     (II) Section 4.9 of the Existing 2010 Senior Notes Indenture or any other
     provision thereof, (III) Section 4.9 of the Existing 2011 Senior Notes
     Indenture or any other provision thereof, or (IV) Section 1014 of the
     Existing 2013 Senior Notes Indenture or any other provision thereof and,
     without limiting the foregoing, on the Initial Borrowing Date, neither the
     incurrence of any Loans to be incurred on such date, nor the incurrence of
     Indebtedness in the full amount of the commitments available under the Term
     Credit Agreement and pursuant to the Total Credit-Linked Commitment (as if,
     in each case, such commitments were fully utilized on


                                      -99-

<PAGE>

     such date), would violate any of the sections specifically set forth above
     (or any other provision) of the Existing Senior Notes Indentures;

          (iii) on the Initial Borrowing Date, (x) all Subsidiary Guarantors and
     (y) all Borrowers (as defined in, and pursuant to, the Term Credit
     Agreement), are "Restricted Subsidiaries" under, and as defined in, each
     Existing Senior Notes Indenture and have executed and delivered guaranties
     in accordance with the requirements of the respective Existing Senior Notes
     Indentures; and

          (iv) for the purpose of the definition of "Permitted Indebtedness"
     under, and as defined in, each Existing Senior Notes Indenture, on the
     Initial Borrowing Date no repayment of term loans and/or permanent
     commitment reductions in the revolving credit portion of the Credit
     Agreement (as defined therein) has theretofore occurred (whether prior to,
     or on, the Initial Borrowing Date) which has resulted in any reduction to
     the maximum aggregate amount of Indebtedness permitted to be incurred
     pursuant to, or under, the Credit Agreement (as defined therein) in
     accordance with the applicable Existing Senior Notes Indenture.

          8.04. Litigation. There are no actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations pending or, to the knowledge of any Senior Officer, threatened
(i) with respect to any Credit Document, (ii) with respect to the Transaction or
any other Document or (iii) that have had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Additionally,
there does not exist any judgment, order or injunction prohibiting or imposing
material adverse conditions upon the occurrence of any Credit Event.

          8.05. Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. (a) All proceeds of
Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans shall be used for the Borrower's and its
Subsidiaries' ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate
purposes (including (x) to effect Permitted Acquisitions (to the extent
permitted by this Agreement) and (y) to (i) make intercompany loans to
Intermediate Holdco pursuant to Section 10.05(xxi) to be utilized for the
purposes described in subclause (v) thereof and/or (ii) pay Dividends to
Intermediate Holdco pursuant to Section 10.06(ix) to be utilized for the
purposes described in subclause (v) thereof but (z) excluding payments in
connection with the Transaction, except as set forth in the immediately
succeeding proviso).

          (b) At the time of each Credit Event occurring on or after the
Effective Date, the aggregate value of all Margin Stock (other than treasury
stock) owned by Holdings and its Subsidiaries (for such purpose, using the
initial purchase price paid by Holdings or such Subsidiary for the respective
shares of Margin Stock) does not exceed $10,000,000. In addition, at the time of
each Credit Event occurring on or after the Effective Date, the value of the
Margin Stock at any time owned by Holdings and its Subsidiaries does not exceed
25% of the value of the assets of Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. Neither the making of any Loan nor the use of the proceeds thereof nor
the occurrence of any other Credit Event will violate or be inconsistent with
the provisions of Regulation T, Regulation U or Regulation X.

          8.06. Governmental Approvals. Except as may have been obtained or made
on or prior to the Effective Date (and which remain in full force and effect on
the Effective Date),


                                      -100-

<PAGE>

no order, consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of, or filing,
recording or registration with, or exemption by, any foreign or domestic
governmental or public body or authority, or any subdivision thereof, is
required to authorize or is required in connection with (i) the execution,
delivery and performance of any Document or (ii) the legality, validity, binding
effect or enforceability of any Document.

          8.07. Investment Company Act. Neither Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

          8.08. True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information (taken as
a whole) heretofore or contemporaneously furnished by or on behalf of Holdings
or any of its Subsidiaries in writing to any Agent or any Lender (including,
without limitation, all information contained in the Documents) for purposes of
or in connection with this Agreement, the other Documents or any transaction
contemplated herein or therein is, and all other such factual information (taken
as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf of any such Persons in writing
to any Agent or any Lender will be, true and accurate in all material respects
on the date as of which such information is dated or certified and not
incomplete by omitting to state any material fact necessary to make such
information (taken as a whole) not misleading in any material respect at such
time in light of the circumstances under which such information was provided, it
being understood and agreed that for purposes of this Section 8.08, such factual
information shall not include the Projections or any projected financial
information contained in any financial projections delivered pursuant to Section
9.01.

          8.09. Financial Condition; Financial Statements. (a) On and as of the
Effective Date, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transaction and
to all Indebtedness (including the Loans) incurred, and to be incurred, and
Liens created, and to be created, by each Credit Party in connection therewith,
with respect to the Borrower (on a stand-alone basis), Holdings and its
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (on
a consolidated basis) (x) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of the
Borrower (on a stand-alone basis), Holdings and its Subsidiaries (on a
consolidated basis) and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) will exceed its or their debts, (y) it has or they have not incurred nor
intended to, nor believes or believe that it or they will, incur debts beyond
its or their ability to pay such debts as such debts mature and (z) it or they
will have sufficient capital with which to conduct its or their business. For
purposes of this Section 8.09(a), "debt" means any liability on a claim, and
"claim" means (i) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured or (ii) right to an
equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a
payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to
judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured
or unsecured. The amount of contingent liabilities at any time shall be computed
as the amount that, in the light of all facts and circumstances existing at such
time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an actual
or matured liability.

          (b) (i) The audited consolidated statements of financial condition of
the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries at December 28, 2002, January 3,
2004 and January 1, 2005 and the related consolidated statements of income and
cash flows and changes in


                                      -101-

<PAGE>

shareholders' equity of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the
fiscal years of the Borrower ended on such dates, in each case furnished to the
Lenders prior to the Effective Date, present fairly in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries at the date of said financial statements and the results for the
respective periods covered thereby and (ii) the Pro Forma Financial Statements
present a good faith estimate of the consolidated pro forma financial condition
of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries and the pro forma results of
operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries for the respective
periods covered thereby (after giving effect to the Transaction at the date
thereof or for the period covered thereby). All of the financial statements
referred to in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied except to the extent
provided in the notes to said financial statements.

          (c) Since December 31, 2005 (but after giving effect to the
Transaction as if same had occurred immediately prior thereto), nothing has
occurred that has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (d) Except as fully reflected in the financial statements described in
Section 8.10(b) and as otherwise permitted by Section 10.04, (i) there were as
of the Effective Date (and after giving effect to any Loans made on such date),
no liabilities or obligations with respect to Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to Holdings and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole and (ii) no Credit Agreement Party knows of any
basis for the assertion against Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries of any such
liability or obligation which, either individually or in the aggregate, has had,
or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) The Projections have been prepared on a basis consistent with the
financial statements referred to in Section 8.9(b) and are based on good faith
estimates and assumptions made by the management of Holdings, and on the
Effective Date, the Borrower believe that the Projections are reasonable and
attainable, it being recognized by the Lenders that such projections of future
events are not to be viewed as facts and that actual results during the period
or periods covered by any such Projections may differ from the projected results
contained therein. There is no fact known to any Credit Agreement Party or any
of its Subsidiaries which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect, which has not been disclosed herein or in such other
documents, certificates and statements furnished to the Lenders for use in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

          8.10. Security Interests. On and after the Effective Date, each of the
Security Documents creates (or after the execution and delivery thereof will
create), as security for the Obligations covered thereby, a valid and
enforceable perfected security interest in and Lien on all of the Collateral
subject thereto, superior to and prior to the rights of all third Persons, and
subject to no other Liens (except that, subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement, (i) the Security Agreement Collateral may be subject to
Permitted Liens, (ii) the Pledge Agreement Collateral may be subject to the
Liens described in clauses (i) and (v) of Section 10.03 and clause (y) of
Section 10.03(iii) and (iii) the security interest and mortgage lien created on
any Mortgaged Property may be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances related

as may be required or desired under local law). No filings or recordings are
required in order to perfect and/or render enforceable as against third parties
the security interests created under any Security Document except for filings or
recordings required in connection with any such Security Document which shall
have been made on or prior to the Effective Date or on or prior to the execution
and delivery thereof as contemplated by Sections 9.11, 9.14 and 10.12.

related trust, insurance contract or fund) is in compliance in all respects with
its terms and in all respects with all applicable laws, including, without

obligations with respect to which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

          (b) Each Foreign Pension Plan has been maintained in substantial
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of any and all applicable
laws, statutes, rules, regulations and orders and has been maintained, where
required, in good standing with applicable regulatory authorities, except to the
extent that such noncompliances, individually or in the aggregate, would not
result in a Material Adverse Effect. All required contributions with respect to
a Foreign Pension Plan have been made. Neither Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred any material outstanding obligation in connection with
the termination of or withdrawal from any Foreign Pension Plan. The present
value of the accrued benefit liabilities (whether or not vested) under each
Foreign Pension Plan, determined as of the end of Holdings' most recently ended
fiscal year on the basis of actuarial assumptions, each of which is reasonable,
did not exceed the current value of the assets of such Foreign Pension Plan
allocable to such benefit liabilities or alternatively, the Foreign Pension Plan
is funded in compliance with applicable law in all material respects and
Holdings and its Subsidiaries have established adequate reserves for the present
value of such accrued benefit liabilities under such Foreign Pension Plan in the
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 9.01(a) and (b).

          8.12. Capitalization. (a) On the Effective Date and after giving

shares of common stock of Holdings, the "Holdings Common Stock"), of which 1000
shares are issued and outstanding. All such outstanding shares have been duly
and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. As of the Effective Date, except as set forth on Part A of Schedule VII
hereto, Holdings does not have outstanding any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for its capital stock or outstanding any rights to subscribe for or
to purchase, or any options for the purchase of, or any agreement providing for
the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims
of any character relating to, its capital stock or any stock appreciation or
similar rights.

          (b) On the Effective Date and after giving effect to the Transaction,

Interests or outstanding any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any
options for the purchase of, or any agreement providing for the issuance
(contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls, commitments or claims of any

similar rights.

          (c) On the Effective Date and after giving effect to the Transaction,
the authorized capital stock of the Borrower shall consist of 1000 shares of
common stock, $.001 par value per share, of which 1000 shares were issued and

the Pledge Agreement. All such outstanding shares


                                      -104-

have been duly and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights. The Borrower does not have outstanding any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its capital stock or outstanding any rights
to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the purchase of, or any
agreement providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or any calls,
commitments or claims of any character relating to, its capital stock or any
stock appreciation or similar rights.

effect to the Transaction, Holdings has no Subsidiaries other than Westlake
Wellbeing Company LLC, The California Wellbeing Institute, LLC and Intermediate
Holdco and its Subsidiaries, and Intermediate Holdco has no Subsidiaries other
than those Subsidiaries listed on Schedule VIII. Schedule VIII correctly sets
forth, as of the Effective Date and after giving effect to the Transaction, (i)
the percentage ownership (direct and indirect) of Intermediate Holdco in each
class of capital stock or other Equity Interests of each of its Subsidiaries and
also identifies the direct owner thereof and (ii) the jurisdiction of

other Equity Interests of each Subsidiary of Intermediate Holdco have been duly
and validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and, in the case of
Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries of the Borrower, have been issued free of
preemptive rights. Except as set forth on Part B of Schedule VII attached

appreciation or similar rights. Except for the existing investments described on

Subsidiaries owns or has the right to use all domestic and foreign patents,

rights in computer programs and databases) and formulas, or other rights with
respect to the foregoing, and has obtained assignments of all leases, licenses
and other rights of whatever nature, in each case necessary for the conduct of
its business, without any known conflict with the rights of others which, or the
failure to obtain which, as the case may be, individually or in the aggregate,
has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.

          8.15. Compliance with Statutes; Agreements, etc. Each of Holdings and
each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with (i) all applicable statutes,
regulations, rules and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by,
all governmental bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect of the conduct of its
business and the ownership of its property and (ii) all contracts and agreements

Environmental Laws and the requirements of any permits issued under such
Environmental Laws and neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable
for any material penalties, fines or forfeitures for failure to comply with any

of its Subsidiaries (including any such claim arising out of the ownership,
lease or operation by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries of any Real Property
formerly owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries but no
longer owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries). There
are no facts, circumstances, conditions or occurrences on any Real Property
owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries (including, to
the knowledge of a Senior Officer, any Real Property formerly owned, leased or
operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries but no longer owned, leased or
operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries) or on any property adjoining or
in the vicinity of any such Real Property that would reasonably be expected (i)
to form the basis of an Environmental Claim against Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries or any such Real Property or (ii) to cause any such Real Property
to be subject to any restrictions on the ownership, occupancy, use or
transferability of such Real Property by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
under any applicable Environmental Law.

          (b) Hazardous Materials have not at any time been generated, used,
treated or stored on, or transported to or from, any Real Property owned, leased

Hazardous Materials have not at any time been Released on or from any Real
Property owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries or by

Subsidiaries (including, to the knowledge of any Credit Agreement Party, any
Real Property owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
but no longer owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries),
except in compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws in all material

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.16, the
representations made in this Section 8.16 shall only be untrue if the aggregate
effect of all conditions, failures, noncompliances, Environmental Claims,
Hazardous Materials, Releases and presence of underground storage tanks, in each
case of the types described above, has had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

          8.17. Properties. All Real Property (other than Real Property with an

vessels owned by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, and all material
leaseholds leased by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as of the
Effective Date and after giving effect to the Transaction, and the nature of the
interest therein, is correctly set forth in Schedule V (and, to the extent that
any such Real Property (or any portion thereof) constitutes "Principal Property"
(as defined in any of the Existing Senior Note Indentures), Schedule XVII
correctly identifies such Real Property (or the applicable portion thereof) as
"Principal Property"). Each of Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries has good
and marketable title to, or a validly subsisting leasehold interest in, all


                                      -106-

          8.18. Labor Relations. Neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged in any unfair labor practice that has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. There is (i) no unfair labor practice complaint pending against Holdings
or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of any Senior Officer,
threatened against any of them, before the National Labor Relations Board or any

                                     -119-

<PAGE>

December 31 of each calendar year and (ii) each of its, and each of its
Subsidiaries', fiscal quarters to end on the last day of each period described
in the definition of "Fiscal Quarter"; provided that Foreign Subsidiaries of
Holdings (other than the Bermuda Company and the Bermuda Partnership) shall not
be required to maintain the fiscal year and fiscal quarter ends described above
if it is not practicable for such Foreign Subsidiary to maintain same as a
result of foreign statutes, rules or law applicable to such Foreign Subsidiary.

          9.11. Additional Security; Additional Guaranties; Actions with Respect
to Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; Further Assurances. (a) Each Credit Agreement
Party will, and will cause its Subsidiaries which are Credit Agreement Parties
or Subsidiary Guarantors to, grant to the Collateral Agent security interests
and mortgages (each, an "Additional Mortgage") in: (i) each vessel acquired by
such Person after the Initial Borrowing Date and having a value (for such
purpose, using the initial purchase price paid by such Person for such vessel)
in excess of $5,000,000, (ii) such fee-owned (or the equivalent) Real Property
acquired by such Person after the Initial Borrowing Date and having a value (for
such purpose, using the initial purchase price paid by such Person for such Real
Property) in excess of $10,000,000 which is not covered by the original
Mortgages, and (iii) such Leasehold Properties to which a respective landlord
has granted its consent to the delivery of a Mortgage over such Leasehold
Properties (each such Real Property referred to in preceding clause (ii) and
this clause (iii), an "Additional Mortgaged Property"); provided, however, that
if the aggregate value of all Second-Tier Material Real Properties (for such
purpose, using the initial purchase price paid by such Person for the respective
Second-Tier Material Real Property) acquired by such Persons after the Initial
Borrowing Date which are not then covered by Mortgages, equals or exceeds
$20,000,000, each Credit Agreement Party and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall
grant to the Collateral Agent security interests and mortgages in all such
Second-Tier Material Real Properties owned by any such Person which are not then
covered by Mortgages (and not just those required to reduce the aggregate value
of all Second-Tier Material Real Properties (determined as provided above) at
such time below $20,000,000). All such Additional Mortgages shall be granted
pursuant to documentation substantially in the form of a relevant existing
Mortgage or in such other form as is reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent. All such Additional Mortgages shall constitute valid and
enforceable Second Priority Liens, superior to and prior to the rights of all
third Persons and subject to no other Liens (except as are permitted by Section
10.03), in favor of the Collateral Agent (or such other trustee or subagent as
may be required or desired under local law). The Additional Mortgages or
instruments related thereto shall be duly recorded or filed in such manner and
in such places as are required by law to create, maintain, effect, perfect,
preserve, maintain and protect the Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent
required to be granted pursuant to the Additional Mortgages and all taxes, fees
and other charges payable in connection therewith shall be paid in full.

          (b) Each Credit Agreement Party will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, at its own expense, make, execute, endorse, acknowledge, file
and/or deliver to the Collateral Agent from time to time such vouchers,
invoices, schedules, confirmatory assignments, confirmatory conveyances,
financing statements, transfer endorsements, confirmatory powers of attorney,
certificates, reports and other assurances or confirmatory instruments and take
such further steps relating to the Collateral covered by any of the Security
Documents as the Collateral Agent may reasonably require pursuant to this
Section 9.11. Furthermore, each Credit Agreement Party will cause to be
delivered to the Collateral Agent such opinions of counsel and


                                     -120-

<PAGE>

other related documents as may be reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent
to assure itself that this Section 9.11 has been complied with.

          (c) Subject to the provisions of following clauses (g) and (h), if at
any time any Domestic Subsidiary of the Borrower is created, established or
acquired, such Subsidiary shall be required to execute and deliver counterparts
of the Subsidiaries Guaranty, the Intercompany Subordination Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement and such Security Documents as would have been entered
into by the respective Subsidiary if same had been a Subsidiary Guarantor on the
Initial Borrowing Date, and in each case shall take all action in connection
therewith as would otherwise have been required to be taken pursuant to Section
6 herein if such Subsidiary had been a Subsidiary Guarantor on the Initial
Borrowing Date.

          (d) In addition to the requirements contained in the Pledge
Agreements, each Credit Agreement Party agrees to pledge and deliver, or cause
to be pledged and delivered, all of the Equity Interests owned by any Credit
Party of each new Unrestricted Subsidiary of Holdings established or created
(and each Subsidiary of Holdings which becomes an Unrestricted Subsidiary) after
the Initial Borrowing Date to the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Creditors pursuant to the Pledge Agreements, provided that, subject to
the provisions of Section 9.12, in the case of any Foreign Unrestricted
Subsidiary that is a corporation (or treated as such for U.S. tax purposes)
which is owned by a Credit Party, not more than 65% of the total outstanding
voting Equity Interests of such Person shall be required to be pledged in
support of such Credit Party's obligations (x) as the Borrower under the Credit
Agreement or (y) under its Guaranty in respect of the Obligations of the
Borrower.

          (e) Following any request by the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders, Holdings or any other Credit Party, shall, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law (but subject to the proviso to preceding clause (d),
to the extent applicable), (x) grant security interests in such of their
Property (other than Excluded Collateral) as may be requested by the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, in which
perfected security interests do not already exist pursuant to the Security
Documents theretofore executed and delivered and, in connection therewith, the
Credit Agreement Parties shall, or shall cause the relevant Subsidiaries of
Holdings which are Credit Parties to, execute and deliver counterparts of (and
thereby become parties to) the applicable Security Documents and/or Additional
Security Documents, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent and/or (y) with respect to pledges of Equity
Interests of, or promissory notes issued by, Persons described in Section 13.17,
take such action (including, without limitation, the execution of Additional
Security Documents, the making of filings, etc.) under the local law of the
Person whose Equity Interests or promissory notes are pledged as may be
requested in order to create, preserve, protect or perfect security interests in
such Equity Interests and/or promissory notes.

          (f) The security interests required to be granted pursuant to Sections
9.11(c), (d) and (e) shall be granted pursuant to the respective Security
Documents already executed and delivered by the Credit Parties (or other
security documentation substantially similar to such Security Documents or
otherwise reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Collateral Agent)
and shall constitute valid and enforceable first priority perfected security
interests prior to the rights of all third Persons and subject to no other Liens
(other than Permitted Liens). The


                                     -121-

<PAGE>

Credit Agreement Parties shall (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries),
(i) at their own expense, to (x) execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause the
execution, acknowledgment and delivery of, and thereafter register, file or
record in any appropriate governmental office, any document or instrument
reasonably deemed by the Collateral Agent to be necessary or desirable for the
creation, perfection, maintenance, preservation and protection of the Liens on
its assets intended to be created pursuant to the relevant Security Documents
and (y) take all other actions reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent
(including, without limitation, the furnishing of legal opinions) in connection
with the granting of the security interests required pursuant to Sections
9.11(c), (d) and (e) and (ii) pay in full all taxes, fees and other charges
payable in connection with the granting of the security interests required
pursuant to Sections 9.11(c), (d) and (e).

          (g) Each Credit Agreement Party agrees that each action required above
by Section 9.11(a) or (b) shall be completed as soon as possible, but in no
event later than 90 days (or, in the case of actions relating to assets located
outside the United States, such greater number of days (not to exceed 120 days)
as the Administrative Agent shall agree to in its sole and absolute discretion
in any given case) after such action is requested to be taken by the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders. Each Credit Agreement Party
further agrees that (x) each action required above by Section 9.11(c), (d) and
(f) with respect to a newly formed, created or acquired Domestic Subsidiary,
shall be completed contemporaneously with the formation, creation or acquisition
of such Domestic Subsidiary, (provided that (x) the Credit Documents required to
be executed and delivered pursuant to Section 9.11(c) by such newly formed,
created or acquired Domestic Subsidiary shall not be required to be so executed
and delivered until 45 days after the formation, creation or acquisition of such
Subsidiary, (y) in the case of a Shell Corporation formed, created or
established by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, such actions shall not
be required to be taken (so long as same remains a Shell Corporation) until 60
days after the formation, creation or establishment of such Shell Corporation
and (z) all actions required to be taken pursuant to the last sentence of
Section 9.11(c) and Section 9.11(e) shall be taken as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within 45 days, after Holdings or the Borrower receives the
respective request from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders.

          (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in clauses (c)
through (g) above, to the extent the taking of any action as described above by
a new Subsidiary acquired pursuant to a Permitted Acquisition, which is subject
to Permitted Acquired Debt which at such time remains in existence as permitted
by Section 10.04(b)(vi), then to the extent that the terms of the respective
Permitted Acquired Debt prohibit the taking of any actions which would otherwise
be required of such Subsidiary by this Section 9.11, then the time for taking
the respective actions (to the extent prohibited by the terms of the respective
Permitted Acquired Debt) shall be extended until 10 Business Days after the
earlier of (i) the date of repayment of such Permitted Acquired Debt and (ii)
the first date on which the taking of such actions would not violate the terms
of the respective issue of Permitted Acquired Debt. To the extent the terms of
any Permitted Acquired Debt prohibits the taking of actions otherwise required
by this Section 9.11, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or the
Required Lenders, each Credit Agreement Party shall, or shall cause the
respective Subsidiaries of Holdings to, (x) prepay any such Permitted Acquired
Debt which is permitted to be prepaid and/or (y) use reasonable efforts to
obtain such consents or approvals as are needed so that the taking of the
actions otherwise


                                     -122-

<PAGE>

specified in this Section 9.11 would not violate the terms of the respective
issue of Permitted Acquired Debt. Furthermore, to the extent any Subsidiary
which is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary is acquired pursuant to a Permitted
Acquisition (in accordance with the limitations contained in the definition
thereof), then for so long as such Subsidiary is not a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary,
to the extent Holdings in good faith determines that the respective Subsidiary
is not able, under applicable requirements of law (whether because of fiduciary
duties under applicable law or other requirements of applicable law) to execute
and deliver a Subsidiaries Guaranty or one or more Security Documents, the
respective such Subsidiary shall not be required to become a Subsidiary
Guarantor or execute and deliver such Security Documents as otherwise required
above.

          (i) In the event that the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
at any time after the Initial Borrowing Date determine in their reasonable
discretion (whether as a result of a position taken by an applicable bank
regulatory agency or official, or otherwise) that real estate appraisals
satisfying the requirements set forth in 12 C.F.R., Part 34-Subpart C, or any
successor or similar statute, role, regulation, guideline or order (any such
appraisal, a "Required Appraisal") are or were required to be obtained, or
should be obtained, in connection with any Mortgaged Property or Mortgaged
Properties, then, within 90 days after receiving written notice thereof from the
Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders, as the case may be, Holdings shall
cause such Required Appraisal to be delivered, at the expense of Holdings, to
the Administrative Agent, which Required Appraisal, and the respective
appraiser, shall be satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above in this
Section 9.11 or elsewhere in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, no
Credit Party shall be required to grant a security interest in, or Lien on, any
Excluded Collateral (so long as the respective Property constitutes Excluded
Collateral), and the value of any Excluded Collateral shall not be taken into
account in making determinations pursuant to the foregoing clauses of this
Section 9.11.

          9.12. Use of Proceeds. Holdings will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use the proceeds of the Loans for the purposes specified in
Section 8.05. No Credit Agreement Party will, nor will it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, use any of the proceeds of the Loans or any Letter of Credit to
finance the acquisition of any Person that has not been approved and recommended
by the board of directors (or functional equivalent thereof) or the requisite
shareholders of such Person.

          9.13. Ownership of Subsidiaries. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (w) Holdings shall at all times own
directly 100% of the Equity Interests of Intermediate Holdco, (x) Intermediate
Holdco shall at all times own directly 100% of the capital stock of Corporate
Holdco and the Borrower, (y) the Borrower shall at all times own directly or
indirectly 100% of the capital stock of the Bermuda Company and (z) subject to
the proviso to the first sentence of Section 9.17(a), Holdings shall at all
times own directly or indirectly (through one or more Wholly-Owned Domestic
Subsidiaries (as opposed to through Foreign Subsidiaries)) all of the capital
stock or other Equity Interests (to the extent owned by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries) of each Domestic Subsidiary of Holdings.


                                     -123-

<PAGE>

          (b) Holdings shall at all times own, directly or indirectly, 100% of
the capital stock or other Equity Interests of its Subsidiaries (except to the
extent (v) with respect to Foreign Subsidiaries, directors' qualifying shares
and other nominal amounts of shares required by applicable law to be held by
Persons (other than directors) are issued from time to time (so long as the
respective Subsidiary continues to constitute a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of
Holdings), (w) 100% of the capital stock or other Equity Interests of any such
Subsidiary are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of pursuant to a
transaction permitted by Section 10.02, (x) less than 100% of the capital stock
or other Equity Interests are acquired in the respective Subsidiary pursuant to
a Permitted Acquisition which meets the criteria specified in the definition of
Permitted Acquisition contained herein, (y) such capital stock or other Equity
Interests are acquired pursuant to an Investment permitted by Sections 10.05(xv)
and (xix) or (z) set forth on Schedule IX).

          9.14. Permitted Acquisitions. (a) Subject to the provisions of this
Section 9.14 and the requirements contained in the definition of Permitted
Acquisition, the Borrower and any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries may from time
to time effect Permitted Acquisitions, so long as (in each case except to the
extent the Required Lenders otherwise specifically agree in writing in the case
of a specific Permitted Acquisition): (i) no Default, Event of Default or
Compliance Period shall be in existence at the time of the consummation of the
proposed Permitted Acquisition or immediately after giving effect thereto; (ii)
the Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the
Lenders) at least 10 Business Days' prior written notice of the proposed
Permitted Acquisition; (iii) all representations and warranties contained herein
and in the other Credit Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects with the same effect as though such representations and warranties had
been made on and as of the date of such Permitted Acquisition (both before and
after giving effect thereto), unless stated to relate to a specific earlier
date, in which case such representations and warranties shall be true and
correct in all material respects as of such earlier date; (iv) the Borrower
provides to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Lenders) as soon as
available but not later than 5 Business Days after the execution thereof, a copy
of any executed purchase agreement or similar agreement with respect to such
Permitted Acquisition; (v) after giving effect to such Permitted Acquisition and
the payment of all post-closing purchase price adjustments required (in the good
faith determination of Holdings) in connection with such Permitted Acquisition
(and all other Permitted Acquisitions for which such purchase price adjustments
may be required to be made) and all capital expenditures (and the financing
thereof) reasonably anticipated by Holdings to be made in the business acquired
pursuant to such Permitted Acquisition within the 180-day period (such period
for any Permitted Acquisition, a "Post-Closing Period") following such Permitted
Acquisition (and in the businesses acquired pursuant to all other Permitted
Acquisitions with Post-Closing Periods ended during the Post-Closing Period of
such Permitted Acquisition), there shall exist no Compliance Period; (vi) such
proposed Permitted Acquisition shall be effected in accordance with the relevant
requirements of Section 9.17; (vii) the Borrower determines in good faith that
Holdings and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are not likely to assume or
become liable for material increased contingent liabilities as a result of such
proposed Permitted Acquisition (excluding, however, Indebtedness permitted to be
incurred pursuant to Section 10.04 in connection therewith); (viii)
substantially all of the Acquired Entity or Business acquired pursuant to the
respective Permitted Acquisition is in a Qualified Jurisdiction, provided,
however, the respective proposed Permitted Acquisition shall not be required to
meet the requirements set forth above in this clause (viii) if the Maximum
Permitted Consideration payable in connection with such Permitted Acquisition,
when aggregated with the Maximum


                                     -124-

<PAGE>

Permitted Consideration payable in connection with all other Permitted
Acquisitions consummated after the Initial Borrowing Date in which all or
substantially all of the Acquired Entity or Business so acquired were not in
Qualified Jurisdictions, does not exceed $300,000,000; and (ix) the Borrower
shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent on the date of the consummation
of such proposed Permitted Acquisition, an officer's certificate executed by an
Authorized Officer of the Borrower, certifying to the best of his knowledge,
compliance with the requirements of preceding clauses (i) through (iii),
inclusive, and clauses (v) through (viii), inclusive, and containing the
calculations required by the preceding clauses (iii) and (viii).

          (b) At the time of each Permitted Acquisition involving the creation
or acquisition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary, or the acquisition of capital
stock or other Equity Interests of any Person (other than a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Borrower), all capital stock or other Equity Interests thereof
created or acquired in connection with such Permitted Acquisition shall be
pledged for the benefit of the Secured Creditors as, and to the extent required
by, Section 9.11 and the relevant Security Documents.

          (c) Each Credit Agreement Party shall cause each Subsidiary that is
formed to effect, or is acquired pursuant to, a Permitted Acquisition to comply
with, and to execute and deliver, all of the documentation required by, Sections
9.11 and 10.13, to the satisfaction of the Administrative Agent.

          (d) The consummation of each Permitted Acquisition shall be deemed to
be a representation and warranty by each Credit Agreement Party that the
certifications by each Credit Agreement Party (or by one or more of its
respective Authorized Officers) pursuant to Section 9.14 are true and correct
and that all conditions thereto have been satisfied and that same is permitted
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which representation and
warranty shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty for all purposes
hereunder, including, without limitation, Sections 8 and 11.

          9.15. Maintenance of Company Separateness. Each Credit Agreement Party
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, satisfy customary Company
formalities, including the holding of regular board of directors' and
shareholders' meetings or action by directors or shareholders without a meeting
and the maintenance of Company records. Neither Holdings nor any other Credit
Party shall make any payment to a creditor of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary in
respect of any liability of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, and no bank account of
any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary shall be commingled with any bank account of
Holdings or any other Credit Party. Any financial statements distributed to any
creditors of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary shall clearly establish or indicate
the corporate separateness of such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary from Holdings and
its other Subsidiaries. Finally, neither Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall take any action, or conduct its affairs in a manner, which is likely to
result in the Company existence of any Credit Agreement Party, any other Credit
Party or any Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries being ignored, or in the assets and
liabilities of Holdings or any other Credit Party being substantively
consolidated with those of any other such Person or any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary
in a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency proceeding.


                                     -125-

<PAGE>

          9.16. Performance of Obligations. Each Credit Agreement Party will,
and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, perform all of its obligations under
the terms of each mortgage, deed of trust, indenture, loan agreement or credit
agreement and each other material agreement, contract or instrument by which it
is bound, except such non-performances as, individually or in the aggregate,
have not caused, and could not reasonably be expected to cause, a Default or
Event of Default hereunder or a Material Adverse Effect.

          9.17. Conduct of Business. (a) The Credit Agreement Parties shall take
all actions so that, at all times from and after the Initial Borrowing Date, all
the assets of Holdings and its Subsidiaries located within the United States,
all Equity Interests in all Domestic Subsidiaries or other U.S. Persons and all
or substantially all of the business of Holdings and its Subsidiaries conducted
in the United States, are, in each case, owned or conducted, as the case may be,
by Holdings and one or more Qualified Obligors which are not direct or indirect
Subsidiaries of any Subsidiary of Holdings which is a Foreign Subsidiary,
provided that if a Foreign Subsidiary (not itself created or established in
contemplation of a Permitted Acquisition) is acquired pursuant to a Permitted
Acquisition which Foreign Subsidiary has (either directly or through one or more
Domestic Subsidiaries) assets or operations in the United States, Holdings shall
have a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 60 days) to effect the transfer
of U.S. assets and operations (including all Equity Interests in any Domestic
Subsidiaries or other U.S. Persons held by it) of the respective Foreign
Subsidiary to one or more Qualified Obligors, provided further, that the
respective transfer shall not be required to be made if Holdings in good faith
determines that such transfer would give rise to adverse tax consequences to
Holdings and its Subsidiaries or would give rise to any material breach or
violation of law or contract (in which case, Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall
transfer such assets and operations at such time, if any, as such adverse tax
consequences or breach or violation would not exist and, until such time, shall
use good faith efforts so that any growth in the assets or operations of the
entity so acquired, to the extent located in the United States, are made within
one or more Qualified Obligors).

          (b) For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the
foregoing provisions of this Section 9.17 shall not prohibit the acquisition of,
or Investments in, Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries as contemplated by Section
9.13(b), provided that the Equity Interest owned by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries in such Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries, to the extent organized
under the laws of any Qualified Jurisdiction, shall be subject to the
requirements of preceding clause (a).

          9.18. Margin Stock. Each Credit Agreement Party shall take all actions
so that at all times the aggregate value of all Margin Stock (other than
treasury stock) owned by Holdings and its Subsidiaries (for such purpose, using
the initial purchase price paid by Holdings or such Subsidiary for the
respective shares of Margin Stock) shall not exceed $10,000,000. So long as the
aggregate value of Margin Stock (other than treasury stock) owned by Holdings
and its Subsidiaries (determined as provided in the preceding sentence) does not
exceed $10,000,000, all Margin Stock at any time owned by Holdings and its
Subsidiaries shall not constitute Collateral and no security interest shall be
granted therein pursuant to any Credit Document. Without excusing any violation
of the first sentence of this Section 9.18, if at any time the aggregate value
of all Margin Stock (other than treasury stock) owned by Holdings and its
Subsidiaries (determined as provided in the first sentence of this Section 9.18)
exceeds


                                     -126-

<PAGE>

$10,000,000, then (x) all Margin Stock owned by the Credit Parties (except to
the extent constituting Excluded Collateral) shall be pledged, and delivered for
pledge, pursuant to the relevant Security Documents and (y) the Borrower shall
execute and deliver to the Lenders appropriate completed forms (including,
without limitation, Forms G-3 and U-1, as appropriate) establishing compliance
with the Margin Regulations. If at any time any Margin Stock is required to be
pledged as a result of the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence,
repayments of outstanding Obligations shall be required to be made, and
subsequent Credit Events shall only be permitted, in compliance with the
applicable provisions of the Margin Regulations.

          9.19. Landlords' Agreements, Mortgagee Agreements, Bailee Letters and
Real Estate Purchases. Each Credit Party shall use its reasonable efforts to
obtain a landlord's agreement, mortgagee agreement or bailee letter, as
applicable, from the lessor of each leased property (including, without
limitation, farms), mortgagee of owned property or bailee with respect to any
warehouse, processor or converter facility or other location where ABL Priority
Collateral with a book value in excess of $5,000,000 is stored or located, which
agreement or letter shall (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by
Administrative Agent) contain a waiver or subordination of all Liens or claims
that the landlord, mortgagee or bailee may assert against the Collateral at that
location, and shall otherwise be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance
to Administrative Agent. With respect to such locations or warehouse space
leased or owned as of the Initial Borrowing Date and thereafter, if the
Collateral Agent has not received a landlord or mortgagee agreement or bailee
letter as of the Initial Borrowing Date (or, if later, as of the date such
location is acquired or leased), any Eligible Inventory at that location shall,
in Administrative Agent's reasonable discretion, be subject to such Reserves as
may be established by Administrative Agent in its Permitted Discretion. Each
Credit Party shall timely and fully pay and perform its obligations under all
leases and other agreements with respect to each leased location or public
warehouse where any Collateral is or may be located except to the extent that
the same are being contested in good faith.

          9.20. Post-Closing Refinancing. To the extent that the condition set
forth in Section 6.07(a)(i) was not satisfied in accordance with its terms on
the Initial Borrowing Date, on the Intermediate Holdco Prepayment Date,
Intermediate Holdco and Corporate Holdco shall, or shall cause the Intermediate
Holdco Paying Agent (for and on behalf of Intermediate Holdco and Corporate
Holdco) to, prepay all of the outstanding Intermediate Holdco Indebtedness
(other than indemnities not then due and payable) (including, without
limitation, the call or other premiums payable in connection therewith and all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to and including the Intermediate Holdco
Prepayment Date) in accordance with, and pursuant to, the terms of the
Intermediate Holdco Credit Agreement and the other Intermediate Holdco Credit
Documents (the "Intermediate Holdco Prepayment Consummation"). In connection
therewith, and the satisfaction of Section 6.07(a)(i), on the Initial Borrowing
Date (with respect to the satisfaction of Section 6.07(a)(i)) or the
Intermediate Holdco Prepayment Date (in connection with the Intermediate Holdco
Prepayment Consummation) and at any time, respectively, thereafter (at the
request of the Administrative Agent or the Intermediate Holdco Paying Agent, as
the case may be, from time to time), the Credit Parties shall take (and use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the respective lenders to take) such
actions (including, without limitation, executing or obtaining appropriate lien
releases and other documents) as the Administrative Agent or the Intermediate
Holdco Paying Agent, as the case may be, may deem


                                     -127-

<PAGE>

reasonably necessary or desirable to (x) release any Lien granted to or held by
any Person under, and pursuant to the terms of, the Intermediate Holdco Credit
Documents and (y) terminate and satisfy in full all of the liabilities and
obligations at any time arising under or in respect of the Intermediate Holdco
Credit Documents (including, without limitation, the Intermediate Holdco
Indebtedness).

          SECTION 10. Negative Covenants. Each Credit Agreement Party hereby
covenants and agrees that as of the Effective Date and thereafter for so long as
this Agreement is in effect and until the Total Commitment has terminated, no
Letters of Credit, Bank Guaranties or Notes are outstanding and the Loans,
together with interest, Fees and all other Obligations (other than any
indemnities described in Section 13.13 which are not then due and payable)
incurred hereunder, are paid in full:

          10.01. Changes in Business; etc. (a) Holdings and its Subsidiaries
will not engage in any business other than a Permitted Business.

jurisdiction or jurisdictions (determined on a book basis without regard to any
write-down or write-off of such assets as a result of such judgment(s) or
decree(s)); or

take any or all of the following actions, without prejudice to the rights of any
Agent or any Lender to enforce its claims against any Credit Party (provided
that if an Event of Default specified in Section 11.05 shall occur with respect
to the Borrower, the result which would occur upon the giving of written notice
by the Administrative Agent as specified in clauses (i) and (ii) below shall

held as security by the Administrative Agent, as is equal to the aggregate
Stated Amount of all Letters of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower
and then outstanding; and (vi) apply any cash collateral held by the

          SECTION 12. The Administrative Agent.

          12.01. Appointment. The Lenders hereby irrevocably designate and
appoint DBNY as Administrative Agent (for purposes of this Section 12 and
Section 13.01, the term "Administrative Agent" also shall include DBNY in its
capacity as Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as
specified herein and in the other Credit Documents. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Note by the acceptance of such


                                      -161-

<PAGE>

Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative Agent to take
such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement, the other
Credit Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to herein or
therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties hereunder and
thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the Administrative
Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of its respective
duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents, employees or
affiliates.

          12.02. Nature of Duties. (a) The Administrative Agent shall not have
any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and in the other Credit Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any
other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by
its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of
the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the
Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder
of any Note; and nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon
the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

          (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or any
provision of any other Credit Document, the Lead Arranger is named as such for
recognition purposes only, and in its capacity as such shall have no powers,
duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to this Agreement or the
other Credit Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; it
being understood and agreed that the Lead Arranger shall be entitled to all
indemnification and reimbursement rights in favor of the Administrative Agent
as, and to the extent, provided for under Sections 12.06 and 13.01. Without
limitation of the foregoing, the Lead Arranger shall not, solely by reason of
this Agreement or any other Credit Documents, have any fiduciary relationship in
respect of any Lender or any other Person.

          12.03. Lack of Reliance on the Administrative Agent. Independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the holder of
each Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made and shall continue to
make (i) its own independent investigation of the financial condition and
affairs of Holdings and its Subsidiaries in connection with the making and the
continuance of the Loans and the taking or not taking of any action in
connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of
Holdings and its Subsidiaries and, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility,
either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender or the holder
of any Note with any credit or other information with respect thereto, whether
coming into its possession before the making of the Loans or at any time or
times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender or the holder of any Note for any recitals, statements, information,
representations or warranties herein or in any document, certificate or other
writing delivered in connection herewith or for the execution, effectiveness,
genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection, collectibility, priority or
sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the financial
condition of Holdings or any of its


                                      -162-

<PAGE>

Subsidiaries or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the
performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the financial condition of Holdings
or any of its Subsidiaries or the existence or possible existence of any Default
or Event of Default.

          12.04. Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent requests instructions from the Required Lenders with
respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders;
and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Lender by reason
of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, neither any Lender nor the
holder of any Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or
refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit Document in
accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders.

          12.05. Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely,
and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing, resolution,
notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier message,
cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message signed, sent
or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be the proper
Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this Agreement and
any other Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder, upon advice
of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent.

          12.06. Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent (or any
affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower, the
Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any affiliate
thereof) in proportion to their respective "percentage" as used in determining
the Required Lenders (determined as if there were no Defaulting Lenders) for and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of whatsoever kind
or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent (or any affiliate thereof) in performing its duties
hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's (or such affiliate's)
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          12.07. The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity. With
respect to its obligation to make Loans, or issue or participate in Letters of
Credit, under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the rights and
powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same rights and
powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein; and the
term "Lender," "Required Lenders," "Holders of Notes" or any similar terms
shall, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, include the
Administrative Agent in its respective individual capacities. The Administrative
Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally
engage in any kind of banking, investment banking, trust or other business with,
or provide debt financing, equity capital or other services (including financial


                                      -163-

<PAGE>

advisory services) to any Credit Party or any Affiliate of any Credit Party (or
any Person engaged in a similar business with any Credit Party or any Affiliate
thereof) as if they were not performing the duties specified herein, and may
accept fees and other consideration from any Credit Party or any Affiliate of
any Credit Party for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise
without having to account for the same to the Lenders.

          12.08. Holders. (a) The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until
a written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as the case
may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any request,
authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such request or
giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Note shall be conclusive
and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee or endorsee, as the
case may be, of such Note or of any Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.

          (b) Without limiting the provisions of preceding clause (a), the
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Agent hereunder may also act in
individual or agency capacities in connection with other financings, including,
without limitation, pursuant to the Term Credit Documents. The parties hereto
agree to each of the Agents acting in such other individual and agency
capacities, and shall not raise any claim in connection therewith (except to the
extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
respective such Person as an Agent hereunder).

          12.09. Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative
Agent may resign from the performance of all its respective functions and duties
hereunder and/or under the other Credit Documents at any time by giving 15
Business Days' prior written notice to the Lenders and, unless a Default or an
Event of Default under Section 11.05 then exists, the Borrower. Any such
resignation by an Administrative Agent hereunder shall also constitute its
resignation as an Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender, in which case the
resigning Administrative Agent (x) shall not be required to issue any further
Letters of Credit or make any additional Swingline Loans hereunder and (y) shall
maintain all of its rights as Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender, as the case
may be, with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it, or Swingline Loans
made by it, prior to the date of such resignation. Such resignation shall take
effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative Agent pursuant to
clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.

          (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by the Administrative Agent,
the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor Administrative Agent hereunder or
thereunder who shall be a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Borrower, which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(provided that the Borrower's approval shall not be required if an Event of
Default then exists).

          (c) If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been so
appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with the
consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be required if an Event
of Default then exists), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until


                                      -164-

<PAGE>

such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative
Agent as provided above.

          (d) If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed pursuant
to clause (b) or (c) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such notice
of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent's
resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall thereafter
perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or under any
other Credit Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

          (e) Upon a resignation of the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 12.09, the Administrative Agent shall remain indemnified to the extent
provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the provisions of
this Section 12 (and the analogous provisions of the other Credit Documents)
shall continue in effect for the benefit of the Administrative Agent for all of
its actions and inactions while serving as the Administrative Agent.

          12.10. Collateral Matters. (a) Each Lender authorizes and directs the
Collateral Agent to enter into the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement. Each Lender hereby agrees, and each holder of any Note by the
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, that, except as otherwise set forth
herein, any action taken by the Required Lenders in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement or the Security Documents, and the exercise by the
Required Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and
binding upon all of the Lenders. The Collateral Agent is hereby authorized on
behalf of all of the Lenders, without the necessity of any notice to or further
consent from any Lender, from time to time prior to an Event of Default, to take
any action with respect to any Collateral or Security Documents which may be
necessary to perfect and maintain perfected the security interest in and liens
upon the Collateral granted pursuant to the Security Documents.

          (b) The Lenders hereby authorize the Collateral Agent, at its option
and in its discretion, to release any Lien granted to or held by the Collateral
Agent upon any Collateral (i) upon termination of the Revolving Loan Commitments
(and all Letters of Credit) and payment and satisfaction of all of the
Obligations (other than inchoate indemnification obligations) at any time
arising under or in respect of this Agreement or the Credit Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) constituting property being
sold or otherwise disposed of (to Persons other than Holdings and its
Subsidiaries) upon the sale or other disposition thereof in compliance with
Section 10.02, (iii) if approved, authorized or ratified in writing by the
Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders hereunder, to the extent required by
Section 13.12) or (iv) as otherwise may be expressly provided in the relevant
Security Documents. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the
Lenders will confirm in writing the Collateral Agent's authority to release
particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section 12.10.

          (c) The Collateral Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to the
Lenders or to any other Person to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned
by any Credit Party or is cared for, protected or insured or that the Liens
granted to the Collateral Agent herein or


                                      -165-

<PAGE>

pursuant hereto have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created,
perfected, protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or
to exercise or to continue exercising at all or in any manner or under any duty
of care, disclosure or fidelity any of the rights, authorities and powers
granted or available to the Collateral Agent in this Section 12.10 or in any of
the Security Documents, it being understood and agreed that in respect of the
Collateral, or any act, omission or event related thereto, the Collateral Agent
may act in any manner it may deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, given the
Collateral Agent's own interest in the Collateral as one of the Lenders and that
the Collateral Agent shall have no duty or liability whatsoever to the Lenders,
except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

          12.11. Delivery of Information. The Administrative Agent shall not be
required to deliver to any Lender originals or copies of any documents,
instruments, notices, communications or other information received by the
Administrative Agent from any Credit Party, any Subsidiary, the Required
Lenders, any Lender or any other Person under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Credit Document except (i) as specifically provided in
this Agreement or any other Credit Document and (ii) as specifically requested
from time to time in writing by any Lender with respect to a specific document,
instrument, notice or other written communication received by and in the
possession of the Administrative Agent at the time of receipt of such request
and then only in accordance with such specific request.

          SECTION 13. Miscellaneous.

          13.01. Payment of Expenses, etc. The Borrower hereby agrees to: (i)
whether or not the transactions herein contemplated are consummated, pay all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent

Case LLP and the Administrative Agent's other counsel and consultants) in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments
referred to herein and therein and any amendment, waiver or consent relating
hereto or thereto, of the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates in connection
with its or their syndication efforts with respect to this Agreement and of the
Administrative Agent and, after the occurrence of an Event of Default, each of
the Issuing Lenders and Lenders in connection with the enforcement of this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the documents and instruments
referred to herein and therein or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings
(including, in each case without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and consultants (including, without limitation, any
inventory consultants) for the Administrative Agent and, after the occurrence of
an Event of Default, counsel for each of the Issuing Lenders and Lenders); (ii)
pay and hold the Administrative Agent, each of the Issuing Lenders and each of
the Lenders harmless from and against any and all present and future stamp,
excise and other similar documentary taxes with respect to the foregoing matters
and save the Administrative Agent, each of the Issuing Lenders and each of the
Lenders harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent attributable to
the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender) to pay such taxes;
and (iii) indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each
Lender, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,


                                      -166-

<PAGE>

representatives, advisors, agents, affiliates, trustees and investment advisors
from and hold each of them harmless against any and all liabilities, obligations
(including removal or remedial actions), losses, damages, penalties, claims,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements (including
reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and disbursements) incurred by,
imposed on or assessed against any of them as a result of, or arising out of, or
in any way related to, or by reason of, (a) any investigation, litigation or
other proceeding (whether or not the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or
any Lender is a party thereto and whether or not such investigation, litigation
or other proceeding is brought by or on behalf of any Credit Party) related to
the entering into and/or performance of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the use of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds of any Loans
hereunder or the consummation of the Transaction or any other transactions
contemplated herein or in any other Credit Document or the exercise of any of
their rights or remedies provided herein or in the other Credit Documents, or
(b) the actual or alleged presence of Hazardous Materials in the air, surface
water or groundwater or on the surface or subsurface of any Real Property at any
time owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, the
generation, storage, transportation, handling or disposal of Hazardous Materials
by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries at any location, whether or not owned,
leased or operated by Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries, the non-compliance by
Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries with any Environmental Law (including
applicable permits thereunder) applicable to any Real Property, or any
Environmental Claim asserted against Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Real Property at any time owned, leased or operated by Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries, including, in each case, without limitation, the reasonable fees
and disbursements of counsel and other consultants incurred in connection with
any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding (but excluding any
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses to the extent incurred by
reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Person to be
indemnified (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable decision)). To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay
or hold harmless the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender set
forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is violative of
any law or public policy, the Borrower shall make the maximum contribution to
the payment and satisfaction of each of the indemnified liabilities which is
permissible under applicable law.

          13.02. Right of Setoff. (a) In addition to any rights now or hereafter
granted under applicable law or otherwise, and not by way of limitation of any
such rights, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Lender and each Lender is hereby
authorized at any time or from time to time, without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind to any Credit Party or to any other Person,
any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to appropriate and
apply any and all deposits (general or special) and any other Indebtedness at
any time held or owing by the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such
Lender (including, without limitation, by branches and agencies of the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender wherever located) to or
for the credit or the account of Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries against and
on account of the Obligations and liabilities of the Credit Parties to the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender under this Agreement or
under any of the other Credit Documents, including, without limitation, all
interests in Obligations purchased by such Lender pursuant to Section 13.04(b),
and all other claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected
with this Agreement or any other Credit Document, irrespective of whether or not
the Administrative Agent, such Issuing Lender or such Lender shall have made any
demand


                                      -167-

<PAGE>

hereunder and although said Obligations, liabilities or claims, or any of them,
shall be contingent or unmatured.

          (b) NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING SUBSECTION (A), AT ANY TIME THAT THE
LOANS OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION SHALL BE SECURED BY REAL PROPERTY LOCATED IN
CALIFORNIA, NO LENDER SHALL EXERCISE A RIGHT OF SETOFF, LIEN OR COUNTERCLAIM OR
TAKE ANY COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION OR INSTITUTE ANY PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE
ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY NOTE UNLESS IT IS TAKEN WITH THE CONSENT
OF THE REQUIRED LENDERS OR APPROVED IN WRITING BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, IF
SUCH SETOFF OR ACTION OR PROCEEDING WOULD OR MIGHT (PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA CODE
OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTIONS 580A, 580B, 580D AND 726 OF THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF
CIVIL PROCEDURE OR SECTION 2924 OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, IF APPLICABLE, OR
OTHERWISE) AFFECT OR IMPAIR THE VALIDITY, PRIORITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THE
LIENS GRANTED TO THE COLLATERAL AGENT PURSUANT TO THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS OR THE
ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND ANY ATTEMPTED
EXERCISE BY ANY LENDER OF ANY SUCH RIGHT WITHOUT OBTAINING SUCH CONSENT OF THE
REQUIRED LENDERS OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT SHALL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS
SUBSECTION (B) SHALL BE SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EACH OF THE LENDERS AND THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREUNDER.

          13.03. Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing
(including telegraphic, telecopier or cable communication) and mailed,
telegraphed, telecopied, cabled or delivered: if to any Credit Party, at the
address specified opposite its signature below or in the other relevant Credit
Documents; if to any Lender, at its address specified on Schedule II; and if to
the Administrative Agent, at the Notice Office; or, as to any Credit Party or
the Administrative Agent, at such other address as shall be designated by such
party in a written notice to the other parties hereto and, as to each Lender, at
such other address as shall be designated by such Lender in a written notice to
the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. All such notices and communications
shall, when mailed, telegraphed, telecopied, or cabled or sent by overnight
courier, be effective when deposited in the mails, delivered to the telegraph
company, cable company or overnight courier, as the case may be, or sent by
telecopier, except that notices and communications to the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower shall not be effective until received by the Administrative
Agent or the Borrower, as the case may be.

          13.04. Benefit of Agreement; Assignments; Participations. (a) This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto; provided,
however, neither Holdings nor the Borrower may assign or transfer any of its
rights, obligations or interest hereunder without the prior written consent of
the Lenders and, provided further, that, although any Lender may transfer,
assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder, such Lender shall remain
a "Lender" for all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or assign all or any
portion of its Revolving Loan Commitments hereunder except as provided in
Sections 2.13 and 13.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or


                                      -168-

<PAGE>

participant, as the case may be, shall not constitute a "Lender" hereunder and,
provided, further, that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation
under which the participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or
waiver of this Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such
amendment or waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan,
Note or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended beyond
the Revolving Loan Maturity Date) in which such participant is participating, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon
(except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default
increase in interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being
understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in
this Agreement or to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the
rate of interest or Fees payable hereunder), or increase the amount of the
participant's participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being
understood that a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory
reduction in the Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of
such participation, and that an increase in any Revolving Loan Commitment (or
the available portion thereof) or Loan shall be permitted without the consent of
any participant if the participant's participation is not increased as a result
thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by Holdings or the Borrower
of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all
or substantially all of the Collateral under all of the Security Documents
(except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) supporting the Loans or
Letters of Credit hereunder in which such participant is participating. In the
case of any such participation, the participant shall not have any rights under
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents (the participant's rights
against such Lender in respect of such participation to be those set forth in
the agreement executed by such Lender in favor of the participant relating
thereto) and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined
as if such Lender had not sold such participation.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender together
with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its Revolving
Loan Commitments and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Revolving Loan
Commitments with respect to the relevant Tranche have terminated, outstanding
Obligations) hereunder to (i)(A) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such
Lender which is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company or (B)
to one or more other Lenders or any affiliate of any such other Lender which is
at least 50% owned by such other Lender or its parent company (provided that any
fund that invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same investment
advisor of another fund which is a Lender (or by an Affiliate of such investment
advisor) shall be treated as an affiliate of such other Lender for the purposes
of this sub-clause (x)(i)(B)), or (ii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund
that invests in loans, any other fund that invests in loans and is managed or
advised by the same investment advisor of any Lender or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a portion equal to at
least $10,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender or assigning
Lenders, of such Revolving Loan Commitments and related outstanding Obligations
(or, if the Revolving Loan Commitments with respect to the relevant Tranche have
terminated, outstanding Obligations) hereunder to one or more Eligible
Transferees (treating any fund that invests in loans and any other fund that
invests in loans and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of
such fund or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor as a single Eligible
Transferee), each of which assignees shall become a party to this Agreement as a
Lender by execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, provided that (i)
at such time, Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the Revolving Loan


                                      -169-

<PAGE>

Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, of such new Lender and
of the existing Lenders, (ii) upon the surrender of the relevant Notes by the
assigning Lender (or, upon such assigning Lender's indemnifying the Borrower for
any lost Note pursuant to a customary indemnification agreement) new Notes will
be issued, at the Borrower's expense, to such new Lender and to the assigning
Lender upon the request of such new Lender or assigning Lender, such new Notes
to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 2.05 (with appropriate
modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised Revolving Loan
Commitments and/or outstanding Loans, as the case may be, (iii) the consent of
the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Lender and, so long as no Default or
Event of Default then exists and the Syndication Date has theretofore occurred,
the Borrower, shall be required in connection with any such assignment pursuant
to clause (y) above (such consent, in any case, not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), (iv) the Administrative Agent shall receive at the time
of each such assignment, from the assigning or assignee Lender, the payment of a
non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 and (v) no such transfer or assignment
will be effective until recorded by the Administrative Agent on the Register
pursuant to Section 13.15. To the extent of any assignment pursuant to this
Section 13.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be relieved of its obligations
hereunder with respect to its assigned Revolving Loan Commitments and
outstanding Loans. At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section
13.04(b) to a Person which is not already a Lender hereunder and which is not a
United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code) for Federal income tax purposes, the respective assignee Lender shall, to
the extent legally entitled to do so, provide to the Borrower the appropriate
Internal Revenue Service Forms (and, if applicable, a Section 5.04(b)(ii)
Certificate) described in Section 5.04(b). To the extent that an assignment of
all or any portion of a Lender's Revolving Loan Commitments and related
outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 2.13 or this Section 13.04(b) would,
at the time of such assignment, result in increased costs under Section 2.10,
3.06 or 5.04 from those being charged by the respective assigning Lender prior
to such assignment, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such
increased costs (although the Borrower, in accordance with and pursuant to the
other provisions of this Agreement, shall be obligated to pay any other
increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the
date of the respective assignment).

          (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any Lender
from pledging its Loans and Notes hereunder to a Federal Reserve Bank in support
of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal Reserve Bank and, with prior
notification to the Administrative Agent (but without the consent of the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower), any Lender which is a fund may pledge all
or any portion of its Loans and Notes to its trustee or to a collateral agent
providing credit or credit support to such Lender in support of its obligations
to such trustee, such collateral agent or a holder of such obligations, as the
case may be. No pledge pursuant to this clause (c) shall release the transferor
Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute (by foreclosure or
otherwise) any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party thereto.

          (d) Any Lender which assigns all of its Revolving Loan Commitments
and/or Loans hereunder in accordance with Section 13.04(b) shall cease to
constitute a "Lender" hereunder, except with respect to indemnification
provisions under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 2.10,
2.11, 3.06, 5.04, 12.06, 13.01 and 13.06), which shall survive as to such
assigning Lender.

          13.05. No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on the part
of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any
Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any other
Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing
Lender or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights,
powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to
any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

          13.06. Payments Pro Rata. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt of
each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of the Obligations
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders
entitled thereto (other than any Lender that has consented in writing to waive
its pro rata share of any such payment) pro rata based upon their respective
shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such payment was
received.

          (b) Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive any amount
hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon security, by the
exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by counterclaim or cross
action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit Documents, or
otherwise), which is applicable to the payment of the principal of, or interest
on, the Loans, Unpaid Drawings, Commitment Commission or Letter of Credit Fees,
of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums received by other Lenders
is in a greater proportion than the total of such Obligation then owed and due
to such Lender bears to the total of such Obligation then owed and due to all of
the Lenders immediately prior to such receipt, then such Lender receiving such
excess payment shall purchase for cash without recourse or warranty from the
other Lenders an interest in the Obligations of the respective Credit Party to
such Lenders in such amount as shall result in a proportional participation by
all the Lenders in such amount; provided that if all or any portion of such
excess amount is thereafter recovered from such Lenders, such purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions of the preceding Sections 13.06(a) and (b) shall be subject to the
express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit, differing
payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting Lenders.

          13.07. Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements to be
furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods involved
(except as set forth in the notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing
by Holdings to the Lenders), provided that (i) except as otherwise


                                      -171-

<PAGE>

specifically provided herein, all computations determining the Excess Cash Flow,
the Senior Leverage Ratio, the Total Leverage Ratio and compliance with Sections
3, 9.14 and 9, including in each case definitions used therein, shall, in each
case, utilize United States accounting principles and policies in effect at the
time of the preparation of, and in conformity with those used to prepare, the
historical consolidated audited financial statements of the Borrower delivered
to the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.10(b) of the Original Credit Agreement for
Fiscal Year 2005, (ii) to the extent expressly required pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, certain calculations shall be made on a Pro Forma
Basis and (iii) for purposes of determining compliance with any incurrence or
expenditure tests set forth in Sections 9 and/or 10, any amounts so incurred or
expended (to the extent incurred or expended in a currency other than Dollars)
shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the exchange rates (as shown on
Reuters ECB page 37 or, if same does not provide such exchange rates, on such
other basis as is reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) as in
effect on the date of such incurrence or expenditure under any provision of any
such Section that has an aggregate Dollar limitation provided for therein (and
to the extent the respective incurrence or expenditure test regulates the
aggregate amount outstanding at any time and it is expressed in terms of
Dollars, all outstanding amounts originally incurred or spent in currencies
other than Dollars shall be converted into Dollars on the basis of the exchange
rates (as shown on Reuters ECB page 37 or, if same does not provide such
exchange rates, on such other basis as is reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent) as in effect on the date of any new incurrence or
expenditures made under any provision of any such Section that regulates the
Dollar amount outstanding at any time).

          (b) All computations of interest, Commitment Commission and other Fees
hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days (except for interest
calculated by reference to (x) the Prime Lending Rate, which shall be based on a
year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable and (y) Sterling LIBOR, which shall be
based on a year of 365 days) for the actual number of days (including the first
day but excluding the last day; except that in the case of Letter of Credit Fees
and Facing Fees, the last day shall be included) occurring in the period for
which such interest, Commitment Commission or Fees are payable.

          13.08. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE; WAIVER OF
JURY TRIAL. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS AND
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE
PROVIDED IN ANY MORTGAGE, BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND BE GOVERNED BY THE

OBJECTION TO SUCH SERVICE OF PROCESS AND FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND AGREES
NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING COMMENCED HEREUNDER OR UNDER
ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS WAS IN ANY WAY INVALID OR
INEFFECTIVE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT,
ANY LENDER OR THE HOLDER OF ANY NOTE TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER
PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST
HOLDINGS OR THE BORROWER IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.

          (b) EACH OF HOLDINGS AND THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY

SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM.

          (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES
ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING

hereof (whether the same or different counterparts) and shall have delivered the
same to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office or, in the case of the
Lenders, shall have given to the Administrative Agent

          13.12. Amendment or Waiver; etc. (a) Neither this Agreement nor any
other Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed, waived,
discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or termination is
in writing signed by the respective Credit Parties party hereto or thereto and
the Required Lenders (although additional parties may be added to (and annexes
may be modified to reflect such additions), and Subsidiaries of the Borrower may
be released from, the Subsidiaries Guaranty and the Security Documents in
accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof without the consent of the
other Credit Parties party thereto or the Required Lenders), provided that no

Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) (with Obligations being directly
affected in the case of following clause (i) or clause (ix)), (i) extend the
final scheduled maturity of any Loan or Note or extend the stated expiration
date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, or reduce
the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in
connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in
interest rates), or reduce (or forgive) the principal amount thereof (it being
understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in
this Agreement or to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the
rate of interest or Fees for the purposes of this clause (i)), (ii) release all
or substantially all of (x) the Collateral (except as expressly provided in the
Credit Documents) under all the Security Documents or (y) the Guarantors under
the Guaranties, (iii) amend, modify or waive any provision of this Section

hereof, will not be deemed such an increase in advance rates), (vii) increase
the percentage of the Borrowing Base for which Agent Advances may be made
pursuant to Section 2.01(e), (viii) increase the Total Commitment (other than as
contemplated by Section 2.14) or (ix) or increase the Revolving Loan Commitment
of any Lender; provided further, that no such change, waiver, discharge or

or waive any provision of Section 1 or alter its rights or obligations with
respect to Letters of Credit, (2) without the consent of the Swingline Lender,
alter the Swingline Lender's rights or obligations with respect to Swingline
Loans,

(3) without the consent of the Administrative Agent, amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 12 or any other provision as same relates to the rights or
obligations of the Administrative Agent, or (4) without the consent of
Collateral Agent, amend, modify or waive any provision relating to the rights or

          (b) If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination of or to any of the provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by
clauses (i) through (v), inclusive, of the first proviso to Section 13.12(a),
the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the consent of one or more
of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not obtained, then the
Borrower shall have the right, so long as all non-consenting Lenders whose
individual consent is required are treated as described in either clause (A) or
(B) below, to either (A) replace each such non-consenting Lender or Lenders (or,
at the option of the Borrower, if the respective Lender's consent is required
with respect to less than all Tranches of Loans (or related Revolving Loan
Commitments), to replace only the Revolving Loan Commitments and/or Loans of the
respective non-consenting Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such
Lender's individual consent) with one or more Replacement Lenders pursuant to
Section 2.13 so long as at the time of such replacement, each such Replacement
Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or termination or (B)
terminate such non-consenting Lender's Revolving Loan Commitment (if such
Lender's consent is required as a result of its Revolving Loan Commitment) the
outstanding Loans of such Lender which gave rise to the need to obtain such
Lender's consent and/or cash collateralize its applicable RL Percentage of the
Letter of Credit of Outstandings, in accordance with Sections 4.02(b) and/or
5.01(b), provided that, unless the Revolving Loan Commitments which are
terminated and Loans which are repaid pursuant to preceding clause (B) are
immediately replaced in full at such time through the addition of new Lenders or
the increase of the Revolving Loan Commitments and/or outstanding Loans of
existing Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto), then in
the case of any action pursuant to preceding clause (B), the Required Lenders
(determined after giving effect to the proposed action) shall specifically
consent thereto, provided, further, that the Borrower shall not have the right
to replace a Lender, terminate its Revolving Loan Commitment or repay its Loans
solely as a result of the exercise of such Lender's rights (and the withholding
of any required consent by such Lender) pursuant to the second proviso to
Section 13.12(a).

          13.13. Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including, without
limitation, in Sections 2.10, 2.11, 3.06, 5.04, 12.06 and 13.01 shall survive
the execution, delivery and termination of this Agreement and the Notes and the
making and repayment of the Obligations.

          13.14. Domicile of Loans. Each Lender may transfer and carry its Loans
at, to or for the account of any office, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Lender.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the extent that a
transfer of Loans pursuant to this Section 13.14 would, at the time of such
transfer, result in increased costs under Section 2.10, 2.11, 3.06 or 5.04 from
those being charged by the respective Lender prior to such transfer, then the
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased costs (although the
Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type
described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective
transfer).

          13.15. Register. The Borrower hereby designates the Administrative
Agent to serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section 13.15, to
maintain a register (the


                                      -175-

<PAGE>

"Register") on which it will record the Revolving Loan Commitments from time to
time of each of the Lenders, the Loans made by each of the Lenders and each
repayment in respect of the principal amount of the Loans of each Lender.
Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in such recordation, shall
not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such Loans. With respect to
any Lender, the transfer of the Revolving Loan Commitments of such Lender and
the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Loan made pursuant to such
Revolving Loan Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is
recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to
ownership of such Revolving Loan Commitments and Loans and prior to such
recordation all amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Revolving
Loan Commitments and Loans shall remain owing to the transferor. The
registration of assignment or Revolving Loan transfer of all or part of any
Revolving Loan Commitments and Loans shall be recorded by the Administrative
Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the Administrative Agent of a
properly executed and delivered Assignment and Assumption Agreement pursuant to
Section 13.04(b). Coincident with the delivery of such an Assignment and
Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for acceptance and registration
of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Loan, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender shall surrender the Note (if
any) evidencing such Loan, and thereupon one or more new Notes in the same
aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the assigning or transferor Lender
and/or the new Lender at the request of any such Lender. The Borrower agrees to
indemnify the Administrative Agent from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages and liabilities of whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted
against or incurred by the Administrative Agent in performing its duties under
this Section 13.15.

          13.16. Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of clause (b) of
this Section 13.16, each Lender agrees that it will use its reasonable efforts
not to disclose without the prior consent of Holdings (other than to its
employees, auditors, advisors or counsel or to another Lender if such Lender or
such Lender's holding or parent company in its sole discretion determines that
any such party should have access to such information, provided such Persons
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 13.16 to the same extent as
such Lender) any information with respect to Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries
which is now or in the future furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Credit Document, provided that any Lender may disclose any such information (i)
as has become generally available to the public other than by virtue of a breach
of this Section 13.16(a) by the respective Lender, (ii) as may be required or
appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal,
state or Federal regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over
such Lender or to the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere)
or their successors, (iii) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any
summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation, (iv) in order to
comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (v)
to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, (vi) to any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar agreement (or to
any such contractual counterparty's professional advisor), so long as such
contractual counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by
the provisions of this Section 13.16 and (vii) to any prospective or actual
transferee or participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or
participation of any of the Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by such
Lender, provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the
confidentiality provisions contained in this Section 13.16.

          (b) Each of Holdings and the Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees
that each Lender may share with any of its affiliates, and such affiliates may
share with such Lender, any information related to Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, any non-public customer information
regarding the creditworthiness of Holdings and its Subsidiaries), provided such
Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 13.16 to the same
extent as such Lender.

          13.17. Special Provisions Regarding Pledges of Equity Interests in,
and Promissory Notes Owed by, Persons Not Organized in the United States. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the provisions of the various Security
Documents executed and delivered by the Credit Parties require that, among other
things, all promissory notes executed by, and capital stock and other Equity
Interests in, various Persons owned by the respective Credit Party be pledged,
and delivered for pledge, pursuant to the Security Documents. The parties hereto
further acknowledge and agree that each Credit Party shall be required to take
all actions under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Credit Party is
organized to create and perfect all security interests granted pursuant to the
various Security Documents and to take all actions under the laws of the United
States and any State thereof to perfect the security interests in the capital
stock and other Equity Interests of, and promissory notes issued by, any Person
organized under the laws of said jurisdictions (in each case, to the extent said
capital stock, other Equity Interests or promissory notes are owned by any
Credit Party). Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, to the
extent any Security Document requires or provides for the pledge of promissory
notes issued by, or capital stock or other Equity Interests in, any Person
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than those specified in the
immediately preceding sentence, it is acknowledged that, as of the Initial
Borrowing Date, no actions have been required to be taken to perfect, under
local law of the jurisdiction of the Person who issued the respective promissory
notes or whose capital stock or other Equity Interests are pledged, under the
Security Documents. The Borrower hereby agrees that, following any request by
the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders to do so, the Borrower will,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take such actions (including, without
limitation, the execution of Additional Security Documents, the making of any
filings and the delivery of appropriate legal opinions) under the local law of
any jurisdiction with respect to which such actions have not already been taken
as are determined by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders to be
necessary or desirable in order to fully perfect, preserve or protect the
security interests granted pursuant to the various Security Documents under the
laws of such jurisdictions. If requested to do so pursuant to this Section
13.17, all such actions shall be taken in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 13.17 and Section 9.12 and within the time periods set forth therein.
All conditions and representations contained in this Agreement and the other
Credit Documents shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to effect the
foregoing and so that same are not violated by reason of the failure to take
actions under local law (but only with respect to capital stock of, other Equity
Interests in, and promissory notes issued by, Persons organized under laws of
jurisdictions other than the United States and any State thereof) not required
to be taken in accordance with the provisions of this Section 13.17, provided
that to the extent any representation or warranty would not be true because the
foregoing actions were not taken, the respective representation of warranties
shall be required to be true and correct in all material respects at such time
as the respective action is required to be taken in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of Section 9.12 and this Section 13.17.

          13.18. Patriot Act. Each Lender subject to the USA PATRIOT ACT (Title
111 of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act") hereby
notifies Holdings and the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Act,
it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
Holdings, the Borrower and the other Credit Parties and other information that
will allow such Lender to identify Holdings, the Borrower and the other Credit
Parties in accordance with the Act.

          13.19. Post-Closing Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that:

          (a) UCC Filings; Filings with respect to Intellectual Property; etc.
(i) Holdings and its Subsidiaries were not required to have filed (or cause to
have filed) on or prior to the Initial Borrowing Date Financing Statements (Form
UCC-1) or any filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or the
United States Copyright Office necessary to perfect the security interest
purported to be created by the Security Agreement or the Pledge Agreement, as
applicable. Not later than the fifth day (or such later date as may be agreed by
the Administrative Agent) after the Initial Borrowing Date, Holdings and its
Subsidiaries shall have filed (or cause to have filed) all of such Financing
Statements (Form UCC-1) and any filings with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office or the United States Copyright Office necessary to perfect the
security interest purported to be created by the Security Agreement or the
Pledge Agreement, as the case may be.

          (b) Real Estate. Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall be required to
take the actions specified in Part A of Schedule XII as promptly as practicable,
and in any event within the time periods set forth in Part A of said Schedule
XII. The provisions of Part A of said Schedule XII shall be deemed incorporated
by reference herein as fully as if set forth herein in its entirety.

          (c) Cash Management Control Agreements. Within 45 days or such later
date the Administrative Agent agrees to, following the Initial Borrowing Date,
(i) the applicable Credit Agreement Parties, the Collateral Agent and the
applicable Collection Banks shall have entered into one or more Cash Management
Control Agreements pursuant to Section 5.03 with respect to each Collection
Account listed on Schedule III, (ii) the applicable Credit Agreement Parties,
the Collateral Agent and the applicable banks shall have entered into one or
more Cash Management Control Agreements with respect to each other Deposit
Account (other than the Excluded Deposit Accounts) and (iii) the Borrower, the
Collateral Agent and the applicable bank shall have entered into a Cash
Management Control Agreement with respect to the Core Concentration Account.

          (d) (d) Other Actions. Holdings and its Subsidiaries shall be required
to take the actions specified in Parts B and C of Schedule XII as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within the time periods set forth in Parts B and C
of said Schedule XII. The provisions of Parts B and C of said Schedule XII shall
be deemed incorporated by reference herein as fully as if set forth herein in
its entirety.

          All conditions precedent and representations contained in this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be deemed modified to the extent
necessary to effect the foregoing


                                      -178-

<PAGE>

(and to permit the taking of the actions described above within the time periods
required above, rather than as elsewhere provided in the Credit Documents),
provided that (x) to the extent any representation and warranty would not be
true because the foregoing actions were not taken on the Initial Borrowing Date,
the respective representation and warranty shall be required to be true and
correct in all material respects at the time the respective action is taken (or
was required to be taken) in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 13.19 and (y) all representations and warranties relating to the
Security Documents shall be required to be true immediately after the actions
required to be taken by Section 13.19 have been taken (or were required to be
taken). The acceptance of the benefits of each Credit Event shall constitute a
representation, warranty and covenant by the Borrower to each of the Lenders
that the actions required pursuant to this Section 13.19 will be, or have been,
taken within the relevant time periods referred to in this Section 13.19 and
that, at such time, all representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall then be true and correct without
any modification pursuant to this Section 13.19, and the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the failure to take any of the actions required
above, within the relevant time periods required above, shall give rise to an
immediate Event of Default pursuant to this Agreement.

          SECTION 14. Credit Agreement Party Guaranty.

          14.01. The Guaranty. In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this
Agreement and to extend credit hereunder, and in recognition of the direct
benefits to be received by each Credit Agreement Party from the proceeds of the
Loans, the issuance of the Letters of Credit, each Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor hereby agrees with the Lenders as follows: each Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, as primary obligor
and not merely as surety the full and prompt payment when due, whether upon
maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all of its Guaranteed
Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors. If any or all of the Guaranteed
Obligations of any Credit Agreement Party Guarantor to the Guaranteed Creditors
becomes due and payable hereunder, each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor
unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed Creditors,
or order, on demand, together with any and all expenses which may be incurred by
the Guaranteed Creditors in collecting any of the Guaranteed Obligations. This
Credit Agreement Party Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not of collection.
This Credit Agreement Party Guaranty is a continuing one and all liabilities to
which it applies or may apply under the terms hereof shall be conclusively
presumed to have been created in reliance hereon. If claim is ever made upon any
Guaranteed Creditor for repayment or recovery of any amount or amounts received
in payment or on account of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and any of the
aforesaid payees repays all or part of said amount by reason of (i) any
judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative body having
jurisdiction over such payee or any of its property or (ii) any settlement or
compromise of any such claim effected by such payee with any such claimant
(including the Borrower), then and in such event the respective Credit Agreement
Party Guarantor agrees that any such judgment, decree, order, settlement or
compromise shall be binding upon such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor,
notwithstanding any revocation of this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty or any
other instrument evidencing any liability of the Borrower, and each Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor shall be and remain liable to the aforesaid payees
hereunder for the amount so repaid or recovered to the same extent as if such
amount had never originally been received by any such payee.


                                      -179-

<PAGE>

          14.02. Bankruptcy. Additionally, each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment of any and all of the
Guaranteed Obligations to the Guaranteed Creditors whether or not due or payable
by the Borrower upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in Section
11.05, and unconditionally promises to pay such indebtedness to the Guaranteed
Creditors, or order, on demand.

          14.03. Nature of Liability. The liability of each Credit Agreement
Party Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or
other guaranty of the Guaranteed Obligations whether executed by such Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor, any other guarantor or by any other party, and the
liability of each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor hereunder is not affected or
impaired by (a) any direction as to application of payment by the Borrower or
any other party, or (b) any other continuing or other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of a guarantor or of any other party as to the Guaranteed
Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other guaranty or
undertaking, or (d) any dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change
in personnel by the Borrower, or (e) any payment made to the Guaranteed
Creditors on the Guaranteed Obligations which any such Guaranteed Creditor
repays to the Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and
each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or
modification of its obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding, or
(f) any action or inaction of the type described in Section 14.05, or (g) the
lack of validity or enforceability of any Credit Document or any other
instrument relating thereto.

          14.04. Independent Obligation. No invalidity, irregularity or
unenforceability of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations or of any
security therefor shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Credit Agreement
Party Guaranty, and this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty shall be primary,
absolute and unconditional notwithstanding the occurrence of any event or the
existence of any other circumstances which might constitute a legal or equitable
discharge of, or a defense available to, a surety or guarantor except
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations. The
obligations of each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor hereunder are independent
of the obligations of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party and a
separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against any Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor whether or not action is brought against the Borrower,
any other guarantor or any other party and whether or not the Borrower, any
other guarantor or any other party be joined in any such action or actions. Each
Credit Agreement Party Guarantor waives, to the full extent permitted by law,
the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or
the enforcement thereof. Any payment by the Borrower or other circumstance that
operates to toll any statute of limitations as to the Borrower shall operate to
toll the statute of limitations as to the relevant Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor.

          14.05. Authorization. Each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor authorizes
the Guaranteed Creditors without notice or demand (except as shall be required
by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing
its liability hereunder, from time to time to:

          (a) change the manner, place or terms of payment of, and/or change or
     extend the time of payment of, renew, increase, accelerate or alter, any of
     the Guaranteed


                                      -180-

<PAGE>

     Obligations (including any increase or decrease in the rate of interest
     thereon), any security therefor, or any liability incurred directly or
     indirectly in respect thereof, and this Credit Agreement Party Guaranty
     shall apply to the Guaranteed Obligations as so changed, extended, renewed,
     increased or altered;

          (b) take and hold security for the payment of the Guaranteed
     Obligations and sell, exchange, release, impair, surrender, realize upon or
     otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property by
     whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever
     securing, the Guaranteed Obligations or any liabilities (including any of
     those hereunder) incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or
     hereof, and/or any offset there against;

          (c) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the
     Borrower or others or otherwise act or refrain from acting;

          (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, the
     Borrower or other obligors;

          (e) settle or compromise any of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
     security therefor or any liability (including any of those hereunder)
     incurred directly or indirectly in respect thereof or hereof, and may
     subordinate the payment of all or any part thereof to the payment of any
     liability (whether due or not) of the Borrower to its creditors other than
     the Guaranteed Creditors;

          (f) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or howsoever realized to any
     liability or liabilities of the Borrower to the Guaranteed Creditors
     regardless of what liability or liabilities of the Borrower remain unpaid;

          (g) consent to or waive any breach of, or any act, omission or default
     under, this Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any of the instruments
     or agreements referred to herein or therein, or otherwise amend, modify or
     supplement this Agreement, any other Credit Document, or any of such other
     instruments or agreements; and/or

          (h) take any other action that would, under otherwise applicable
     principles of common law, give rise to a legal or equitable discharge of,
     or a defense available to, such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor from its
     liabilities under this Credit Agreement Party Guarantor Guaranty.

          14.06. Reliance. It is not necessary for the Guaranteed Creditors to
inquire into the capacity or powers of the Borrower or the officers, directors,
partners or agents acting or purporting to act on their behalf, and any
Guaranteed Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise
of such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.

          14.07. Subordination. Any of the indebtedness of the Borrower now or
hereafter owing to any Credit Agreement Party Guarantor is hereby subordinated
to the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower owing to the Guaranteed Creditors;
and if the Administrative Agent so requests at a time when an Event of Default
exists, all such indebtedness of the Borrower to such Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor shall be collected, enforced and received by such Credit


                                      -181-

<PAGE>

Agreement Party Guarantor in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors
and be paid over to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed
Creditors on account of the Guaranteed Obligations of the Borrower to the
Guaranteed Creditors, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the
liability of any Credit Agreement Party Guarantor under the other provisions of
this Credit Agreement Party Guarantor Guaranty. Prior to the transfer by any
Credit Agreement Party Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing
any of the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor, such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor shall mark such note or
negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this
subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors that it
will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise
have as a result of this Credit Agreement Party Guarantor Guaranty (whether
contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until all
Guaranteed Obligations have been irrevocably paid in full in cash.

          14.08. Waiver. (a) Each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor waives any
right (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived)
to require any Guaranteed Creditor to (i) proceed against any the Borrower, any
other guarantor or any other party, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security
held from the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party or (iii) pursue
any other remedy in any Guaranteed Creditor's power whatsoever. Each Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor waives any defense based on or arising out of any
defense of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other party, other than
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations, based on or
arising out of the disability of the Borrower, any other guarantor or any other
party, or the unenforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof
from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of the Borrower
other than indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations.
The Guaranteed Creditors may, at their election, foreclose on any security held
by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Guaranteed
Creditor by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every
aspect of any such sale is commercially reasonable (to the extent such sale is
permitted by applicable law), or exercise any other right or remedy the
Guaranteed Creditors may have against the Borrower or any other party, or any
security, without affecting or impairing in any way the liability of any Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Guaranteed
Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. Each Credit Agreement
Party Guarantor waives any defense arising out of any such election by the
Guaranteed Creditors, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish
any right of reimbursement or subrogation or other right or remedy of such
Credit Agreement Party Guarantor against the Borrower or any other party or any
security.

          (b) Each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor waives all presentments,
demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation,
notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of
acceptance of this Credit Agreement Party Guarantor Guaranty, and notices of the
existence, creation or incurring of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.
Each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and
keeping itself informed of the Borrower's financial condition and assets, and of
all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Guaranteed
Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of the risks which such Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that the
Guaranteed Creditors shall have no duty to advise any


                                      -182-

<PAGE>

Credit Agreement Party Guarantor of information known to them regarding such
circumstances or risks.

          (c) Until such time as the Guaranteed Obligations have been paid in
full in cash, each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor hereby waives all rights of
subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Credit
Agreement Party Guarantor Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of
the Bankruptcy Code, or otherwise) to the claims of the Guaranteed Creditors
against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations and
all contractual, statutory or common law rights of reimbursement, contribution
or indemnity from the Borrower or any other guarantor which it may at any time
otherwise have as a result of this Credit Agreement Party Guarantor Guaranty.

          (d) Each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor hereby acknowledges and
affirms that it understands that to the extent the Guaranteed Obligations are
secured by Real Property located in California, such Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder
notwithstanding the foreclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any
other reason impairing such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor's or any Guaranteed
Creditor's right to proceed against the Borrower or any other guarantor of the
Guaranteed Obligations. In accordance with Section 2856 of the California Code
of Civil Procedure, each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor hereby waives:

          (i) all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and
     contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become
     available to such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor by reason of Sections
     2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433 of the California Code of Civil
     Procedure;

          (ii) all rights and defenses that such Credit Agreement Party
     Guarantor may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real
     Property located in California, meaning, among other things, that: (A) the
     Guaranteed Creditors may collect from such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor
     without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral
     pledged by any Credit Party, and (B) if the Guaranteed Creditors foreclose
     on any Real Property collateral pledged by any Credit Party, (1) the amount
     of the Guaranteed Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which
     that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is
     worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Guaranteed Creditors may
     collect from such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor even if the Guaranteed
     Creditors, by foreclosing on the Real Property collateral, have destroyed
     any right such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor may have to collect from
     the Borrower, it being understood that this is an unconditional and
     irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses such Credit Agreement Party
     Guarantor may have because the Guaranteed Obligations are secured by Real
     Property (including, without limitation, any rights or defenses based upon
     Section 580a, 580d or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure); and

          (iii) all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies
     by the Guaranteed Creditors, even though that election of remedies, such as
     a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for the Guaranteed
     Obligations, has destroyed such Credit Agreement Party Guarantor's rights
     of subrogation and reimbursement against the

     Borrower by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil
     Procedure or otherwise.

          (e) Each Credit Agreement Party Guarantor warrants and agrees that
each of the waivers set forth above is made with full knowledge of its
significance and consequences and that if any of such waivers are determined to
be contrary to any applicable law of public policy, such waivers shall be
effective only to the maximum extent permitted by law.

          14.09. Payments. All payments made by a Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor pursuant to this Section 14 shall be made in the respective Applicable
Currency in which the Guaranteed Obligations are then due and payable (giving
effect, in the circumstances contemplated by Section 2.14, to any conversion
occurring pursuant thereto). All payments made by a Credit Agreement Party
Guarantor pursuant to this Section 14 will be made without setoff, counterclaim
or other defense, and shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 5.03, 5.04
and 13.23.
