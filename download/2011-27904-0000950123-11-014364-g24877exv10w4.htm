by this reference and shall be binding on Delta; <U><I>provided that</I></U>, other than as expressly
provided in Article&nbsp;34, Delta shall have no other environmental obligations or liabilities under
Article&nbsp;18A of the Port/IAT Lease. Delta shall enter into all Phase I IAT Project Construction

construction contracts for the Phase I IAT Project shall be fixed priced contracts or guaranteed
maximum cost contracts obtained through a competitive bidding process acceptable to Delta and IAT
in all respects; <U><I>provided, however, that</I></U> Delta (with IAT&#146;s approval) may select other
construction delivery methods or formats for specific portions of the Phase I IAT Project. Delta

reasonable, equitable and nondiscriminatory and shall at all times comply with the requirements of

the attention of the Management Committee for expedited resolution. Pending a decision by the
Management Committee on the matter in dispute, IAT shall continue to carry out day-to-day
operations regarding the matter in dispute in accordance with best management practices. The
Operations Advisory Committee shall also act with respect to the following matters: (i)
consultation in connection with the scheduling and use of Gates and times, including accommodations
necessary for the Phase I IAT Project (and Phase II and Phase III, as applicable), (ii)&nbsp;the matters

In addition, no Alteration shall (i)&nbsp;decrease the value, utility or useful life of Terminal 4 from

in writing to IAT the proposed schedule for use of the Delta Gates and Hardstand Positions included
within the Delta Premises (&#147;<B>Delta Hardstand Positions</B>&#148;) for the scheduled flights of Delta and
Delta Affiliate Carriers during such upcoming scheduling season. Delta shall update the proposed
schedule with the official scheduling information loaded into the publicly available scheduling
database operated by OAG (or any successor industry-wide commercial airline scheduling database),

Scheduled Aircraft Operators to become Contract Carriers for such designated Delta Gates, for a

lessees and permittees thereon. The performance by Delta of the covenants, promises and
obligations contained in this Agreement is therefore a special consideration and inducement to the
Port Authority&#146;s consent to this Agreement, and if the Administrator of the Federal Aviation
Administration or any other governmental officer or body having jurisdiction over the enforcement
of the obligations of the Port Authority in connection with the Federal Airport Aid, shall make any

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">For purposes of this Section&nbsp;V.B, &#147;<B>Delta Flights</B>&#148; means flights operated by Delta or a Delta
Affiliate Carrier and &#147;<B>non-Delta Flights</B>&#148; means all other flights operating at Terminal 4. &#147;<B>Delta

Passenger</B>&#148; means a passenger arriving at Terminal 4 who is considered by the United States Customs
and Border Protection to be an international passenger entering the United States through the
Airport. To calculate Delta Rental for Delta Premises in the Terminal Cost Center, the cost per
square foot of Usable Area for each Terminal Sub-Cost Center (calculated in Table F below) shall be
multiplied by the number of square feet of Usable Area within each functional area of such Terminal
Sub-Cost Center (shown in Table G, below) resulting in the &#147;<B>Functional Area Requirement</B>&#148; for each
&#147;<B>Functional Area</B>&#148; and in the Requirement for each Terminal Sub-Cost Center as shown in Table H.
Lastly, costs allocated to each of the Terminal Functional Area in Table H shall be allocated to
IAT Carriers and Delta as defined below and summarized in Table I.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">B. As part of the budgeting process, the upcoming Annual Period&#146;s Terminal 4 Gate Use Fee will
be established by determining the average number of turns (rounded to the nearest tenth) per day
per gate during the just-ending fiscal year (annualizing any partial year periods that a gate was
in service), resulting in the &#147;Average Turn Number&#148;. The Terminal 4 Gate Use Fee for the upcoming
Annual Period will be established by dividing the Daily Gate Cost Allocation by the Average Turn
Number.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">C. Where applicable, the Terminal 4 Gate Use Fee will be paid or credited, as the case may be, for
each Turn. A &#147;Turn&#148; means the arrival and departure of an aircraft, excluding returns to ramp not
involving a change of load. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one-half (1/2) of the Terminal 4 Gate
Use Fee will be paid or credited, as the case may be, for aircraft diversions using a Delta Gate or
IAT Gate as appropriate that do not involve the deplanement of passengers or a change of load.
