The Borrowers or other Loan Party, upon the request of such Lender Party, shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, repay to such Lender Party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (g) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such Lender Party is required to repay such refund to the relevant Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will the Lender Party be required to pay any amount to a Loan Party the payment of which would place the Lender Party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Lender Party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid.

Each Lender Party hereby irrevocably appoints, designates and authorizes each of the Agents to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, no Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall any Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender Party or participant, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against such Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each Issuing Bank shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each Issuing Bank shall have all of the benefits (including indemnities) and immunities (i)&nbsp;provided to each Agent in this Article&nbsp;VII with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Issuing Bank in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the applications and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term &#8220;Agent&#8221; as used in this Article&nbsp;VII and in the definition of &#8220;Agent-Related Person&#8221; included such Issuing Bank with respect to such acts or omissions, and (ii)&nbsp;as additionally provided herein with respect to such Issuing Bank. The provisions of this Article&nbsp;VII are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties, and neither any Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any such provisions.</p>

In particular, none of the Administrative Agent nor any of its Agent-Related Persons (i)&nbsp;shall have, and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of itself and each of its Agent-Related Persons, hereby disclaims, any duty to ascertain or inquire as to whether or not a Lender Party has or has not limited its access to Restricting Information, such Lender Party&#8217;s policies or procedures regarding the safeguarding of material, nonpublic information or such Lender Party&#8217;s compliance with applicable laws related thereto or (ii)&nbsp;shall have, or incur, any liability to any Loan Party or Lender Party or any of their respective Agent-Related Persons arising out of or relating to the Administrative Agent or any of its Agent-Related Persons providing or not providing Restricting Information to any Lender Party.</p>
