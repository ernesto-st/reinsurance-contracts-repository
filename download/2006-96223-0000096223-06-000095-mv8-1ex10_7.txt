                                   Definitions

                  "Applicable Margin" means for any Interest Period with respect

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
             2                Baa2/BBB                          0.625%
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
             3                Baa3/BBB-                         0.750%
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
             4                Bal/BB+                           0.875%

are separated by one or more other Rate Levels in the table above), the
Applicable Margin shall be as set forth in the next Rate Level below the Rate
Level in which the highest rating falls. If the rating system of Moody's or S&P
shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the business
of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders shall
negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed rating

                                   The Credit

                  2.01. Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, each Lender agrees to make Revolving Loans in Dollars and/or any
Optional Currency to the Borrower from time to time during the Availability

                                       15
<PAGE>
                  (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but
subject to Section 2.05(c), at no time shall the Dollar Equivalent of the sum of
the aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding (after giving
effect to all Loans requested) and all Swingline Loans outstanding exceed the
Total Commitment of the Lenders then in effect. The Dollar Equivalent of the
principal amount of the Revolving Loans outstanding from each Lender to the
Borrower shall not at any time exceed in the aggregate an amount (after giving
effect to all Loans requested) equal to such Lender's pro rata portion (based on
its Commitment) times (i) the Total Commitment minus (ii) the sum of the

foregoing limits, and subject to all of the other terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the Borrower may borrow, prepay pursuant to Section 2.11
hereof, and reborrow Revolving Loans.

                  2.02. Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be
made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders
ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any
Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other
Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the
Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender's
failure to make Loans as required.

                  (b) Subject to Section 2.14, (i) each Revolving Borrowing
shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or Eurocurrency Loans as the Borrower
may request in accordance herewith. Each Swingline Loan shall be an ABR Loan.
Each Lender at its option may make any Eurocurrency Loan by causing any domestic
or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that
any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to
repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Each ABR Loan or
Swingline Loan shall be denominated in Dollars, and each Eurocurrency Loan shall
be denominated in Dollars or, subject to Section 2.04, in an Optional Currency.

                  (c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any
Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount
that is an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $5,000,000. At the
time that each ABR Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $250,000 and not less than
$5,000,000; provided that an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate
amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the total Commitments. Each
Swingline Loan shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000
and not less than $1,000,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and Class may be
outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any time be more
than a total of 10 Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowings outstanding.

                  (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end
after the Maturity Date.

                  2.03. Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a
Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
request by telephone (a) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of the
proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00
a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before the date of the proposed
Borrowing. Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall
be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent
of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by the Borrower. Each such telephonic and written Borrowing Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:


                                       16
<PAGE>
                      (i) the aggregate amount of the requested Borrowing stated
           in either Dollars or (subject to Section 2.04) an Optional Currency;

                      (ii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business
           Day;

                      (iii) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or
           a Eurocurrency Borrowing (and, if a Eurocurrency borrowing
           denominated in an Optional Currency is requested, such Borrowing
           Request must comply with the requirements of a OC Request pursuant to
           Section 2.04 hereof);

                      (iv) in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, the initial
           Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
           contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

                      (v) the location and number of the Borrower's account to
           which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
           requirements of Section 2.06.

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing is specified, then the
requested Revolving Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing,
then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one
month's duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in
accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender
of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender's Loan to be made as
part of the requested Borrowing.

                  2.04. Procedure for Optional Currencies. (a) Request for
Optional Currency. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.01, the
Borrower may upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, request that one or more Revolving Loans be made as
Eurocurrency Loans in an Optional Currency (an "OC Request"); provided that any
Eurocurrency Loan requested shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000, and
shall be in an integral multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof. Each OC Request
shall be in writing (or by confirmed electronic communication or by telephone
confirmed in writing) and shall specify (in addition to compliance with the
requirements of a Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 2.03): (i) the Optional
Currency in which the Eurocurrency Loan is requested to be made and (ii) in the
case of an Optional Currency which is the legal tender of a country in which the
Administrative Agent has no office, the Borrower's account with a depository in
such country to which payment of the proceeds of such Eurocurrency Loan is
requested to be made. If any Lender, on or prior to the second Business Day
preceding the first day of any Interest Period for which an OC Request has been
delivered requesting a Eurocurrency Loan in an Optional Currency or on any
funding date, determines (which determination shall be conclusive) that the
Optional Currency requested is not freely transferable and convertible into
Dollars or that it will be impracticable for such Lender to fund the requested
Revolving Loan in such Optional Currency, then such Lender shall so notify the
Administrative Agent, which notification shall be given immediately by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower, and such Lender's portion of the requested
Revolving Loan shall, notwithstanding any contrary election by the Borrower or
any other provisions hereof, be denominated in Dollars as an ABR Loan unless the
Borrower, one Business Day prior to the commencement of such Interest Period and
by notice complying with the requirements of Section 2.03 hereof, elects to have
such Lender's Revolving Loan denominated in Dollars as a Eurocurrency Loan. In
the event that the Borrower repays such portion of a Revolving Loan denominated
in Dollars as an ABR Loan or a Eurocurrency Loan, as the case may be, in
accordance with Section 2.01 and such repayment results in Revolving Loans
outstanding that are not pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Credit
Exposure of the Lenders, then all subsequent principal repayments denominated in
the Optional Currency which the applicable Lender did not advance shall be made
by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the respective accounts of such


                                       17
<PAGE>
Lenders other than the Lender which did not advance the Optional Currency on a
pro rata basis until such time as the Revolving Loans are outstanding on a pro
rata basis. Subject to the foregoing and to the satisfaction of the terms and
conditions of Article IV, each Revolving Loan requested to be made in an
Optional Currency shall be made on the date specified therefor in the related
Borrowing Request, in the currency requested in the related OC Request and, upon
being so made, will have the Interest Period requested in the related Borrowing
Request.

                  (b) Exchange Rate. For purpose of this Agreement the amount in
one currency which shall be equivalent on any particular date to a specified
amount in another currency shall be that amount (as conclusively ascertained by
the Administrative Agent by its normal banking practices, absent manifest error)
in the first currency which is or could be purchased by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with its normal banking practices with such specified amount in
the second currency in any recognized Eurocurrency Interbank Market selected by
the Administrative Agent in good faith for delivery on such date at the spot
rate of exchange prevailing at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time), or as soon
thereafter as practicable, on such date.

                  (c) Denominations. In the event that any portion of the funds
available under the terms of this Agreement is denominated in an Optional
Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of such portion of the funds shall be calculated
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) above. The amount so determined shall then be added
to the amount already outstanding in Dollars for the purpose of determining the
remaining availability of funds under Section 2.01 and any required repayments
under clause (d) of this Section 2.04.

                  (d) Repayment. If at any time prior to the Maturity Date, the
Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of all Revolving
Loans and Swingline Loans shall exceed the Total Commitment for three or more
consecutive Business Days as a result of fluctuations in applicable conversion
rates between Dollars and any Optional Currencies, the Borrower shall pay or
cause to be paid immediately, upon demand made by the Administrative Agent, such
amounts as are sufficient to eliminate such excess and to reduce the aggregate
principal amount outstanding to the Dollar Equivalent of the Total Commitment.
In the event there are any Revolving Loans outstanding which are denominated in
an Optional Currency, the Administrative Agent shall provide the Lenders and the
Borrower with calculations on the last day of each calendar month that such
Loans are outstanding as to the Dollar Equivalents of such Revolving Loans.

                  (e) Funding. Each Lender may make any Eurocurrency Loan
denominated in an Optional Currency by causing any of its foreign branches or
foreign affiliates to make such Eurocurrency Loan (whether or not such branch or
affiliate is named as a lending office on the signature pages hereof); provided
that in such event the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Eurocurrency
Loan shall nevertheless be to such Lender and shall, for all purposes of this
Agreement (including without limitation for purposes of the definition of the
term "Required Lenders") be deemed made by such Lender, to the extent of such
Eurocurrency Loan, for the account of such branch or affiliate.

                  2.05. Swingline Loans. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the
Borrower from time to time during the Availability Period, in an aggregate
principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $10,000,000;
provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline
Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan. Within the foregoing limits and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may borrow,
prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.


                                       18
<PAGE>
                  (b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such request (a "SL Loan Request") by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy), not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the
day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of
the requested Swingline Loan. The Administrative Agent will promptly advise the
Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. Upon
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by
means of a credit to the general deposit account of the Borrower with the
Swingline Lender by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such
Swingline Loan; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not advance any
Swingline Loans after it has received notice that a Default has occurred and has
not been cured or waived in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
The Swingline Lender shall not be obligated to make any Swingline Loans at any
time when any Lender is a Delinquent Lender unless the Swingline Lender has
entered into arrangements satisfactory to it to eliminate the Swingline Lender's
risk with respect to such Delinquent Lender, including by cash collateralizing
such Delinquent Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure of the outstanding Swingline
Loans and any such additional Swingline Loans to be made.

                  (c) The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the
Administrative Agent not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on any
Business Day require the Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day
in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall
specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Lenders will
participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will
give notice thereof to each Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender's
Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender hereby
absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above,
to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender,
such Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans. Each Lender
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations in
Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute, irrevocable and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever,
including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or
termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without
any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Lender shall
comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to
Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to
the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall
promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the
Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower of any
participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to this paragraph, and
thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the
Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts received by
the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the
Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender
of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be promptly remitted
to the Administrative Agent; any such amounts received by the Administrative
Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders that
shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline
Lender, as their interests may appear; provided that any such payment so
remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent,
as applicable, if and to the extent such payment is required to be refunded to
the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan
pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the
payment thereof.

                  2.06. Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each
Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, New York City time, to the account of
the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by
notice to the Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided


                                       19
<PAGE>
in Section 2.05. The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the
Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an
account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent in New York
City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.

                  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate
and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking
industry rules on interbank compensation; provided that in the case of Loans
denominated in an Optional Currency such Lender shall pay the rate of interest
per annum on which overnight deposits in such Optional Currency would be offered
for such day by the Administrative Agent to major banks in the London interbank
market, or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR
Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such
amount shall constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

                  2.07. Interest Elections. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing
initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request
and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, shall have an initial
Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Borrower
may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and , in the case of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, may elect
Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may
elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected
Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the
Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising
each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section shall
not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

                  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower
shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower
were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest
Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.

                  (c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request
shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.03.

                      (i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
           applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
           different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to
           each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
           specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified
           for each resulting Borrowing);


                                       20
<PAGE>
                      (ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to
           such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

                      (iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
           Borrowing or a Eurocurrency Borrowing; and

                      (iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurocurrency
           Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving
           effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the
           definition of the term "Interest Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurocurrency Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

                  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election
Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

                  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing prior to the
end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, (i) as to any Eurocurrency
Loan denominated in Dollars, such Eurocurrency Loan shall be automatically
converted to an ABR Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating
thereto, and (ii) as to any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Optional
Currency, such Eurocurrency Loan shall be repaid on the last day of the Interest
Period relating thereto. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at
the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as
an Event of Default is continuing (x) as to any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in
Dollars, no such Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such but shall be
automatically converted to an ABR Loan on the last day of the first Interest
Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Event of Default;
(y) as to any Eurocurrency Loan denominated in an Optional Currency, no such
Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such but shall be repaid by the Borrower
on the last day of the Interest Period relating thereto.

                  2.08. Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

                  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to
time reduce, the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the
Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and
not less than $10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce
the Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the
Loans in accordance with Section 2.11, the Revolving Credit Exposures would
exceed the total Commitments.

                  (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any
election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this
Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such
termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date
thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent
shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice
of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such
notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in
which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such
condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments
shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably
among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. Termination


                                       21
<PAGE>
of Commitments shall also terminate the obligation of the Lenders to make Loans.

                  2.09. Increase of Total Commitment; Additional Lenders. The
Borrower shall have the right upon one or more occasions by written notice to
the Administrative Agent (a "Commitment Increase Request") to request an
increase in the Total Commitment (the amount of increase requested on any
occasion being referred to herein as the "Increase Amount"), up to a maximum
Total Commitment of $175,000,000; provided that, at the time of the Commitment
Increase Request and at the time such request would become effective, no Default
has occurred and is continuing or would exist after giving effect to such
increase in the Total Commitment. Following a Commitment Increase Request, one
or more other Persons (other than individuals) (an "Additional Lender") that
have agreed to provide the Increase Amount and that are acceptable to each of
the Administrative Agent and Borrower may be admitted as a Lender party to this
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.04(e); provided that
the Commitment of any such Additional Lender shall not be less than $10,000,000
nor greater than the difference between the new Total Commitment and the
aggregate Commitments of the other Lenders (including the Commitment of any
other Additional Lender being admitted at the same time as a Lender party to
this Agreement). Any such increase in the Total Commitment shall become
effective only upon written notice by the Administrative Agent to the Borrower
and the Lenders specifying the effective date of such increase in Total
Commitment, together with a revised Schedule 2.01 stating the new Total
Commitment, and, in respect thereof, the Commitment Amount of each Additional
Lender, the respective continuing Commitment Amounts of the other Lenders and
the new Revolving Credit Exposure of the Lenders. Upon the effective date of the
increased Total Commitment, each Additional Lender shall make all (if any) such
payments to the Administrative Agent for distribution to the other Lenders as
may be necessary to result in the respective Revolving Loans held by such
Additional Lender and the other Lenders being equal to such applicable Lender's
Revolving Credit Exposure (as set forth in the revised Schedule 2.01) of the
aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Loans outstanding as of such date.
The Borrower hereby agrees that any Additional Lender so paying any such amount
to the other Lenders pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be entitled to all
the rights of a Lender having Commitments hereunder in respect of such amounts,
that such payments to such other Lenders shall thereafter constitute Revolving
Loans made by such Additional Lender hereunder and that such Additional Lender
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all of its right of
payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such amounts as fully
as if such Additional Lender had initially advanced to the Borrower directly the
amount of such payments. If any such adjustment payments pursuant to the
preceding sentences of this Section 2.09 are made by an Additional Lender to
other Lenders at a time other than the end of an Interest Period in the case of
all or any portion of Revolving Loans constituting Eurocurrency Loans, the
Borrower shall pay to each of the Lenders receiving any such payment, at the
time that such payment is made pursuant to this Section 2.09, the amount that
would be required to be paid by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.16 had such
payments been made directly by the Borrower.

                  2.10. Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower
hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan
on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first
date after such Swingline Loan is made that is the 15th or last day of a
calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is
made; provided that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the
Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding. On the Maturity Date,
there shall become absolutely due and payable and the Borrower will pay all of
the Loans outstanding, together with any and all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon.

                                       22
<PAGE>
                  (b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which
it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by
the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each
Lender's share thereof.

                  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be conclusive evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein absent manifest error;
provided that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation
of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

                  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender
(or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced
by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04(a)) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

                  2.11. Prepayment of Loans. (a) The Borrower shall have the
right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in
part, subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

                  (b) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and,
in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurocurrency Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case
of prepayment of an ABR Revolving Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, one Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case
of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall
specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or
portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a notice of prepayment is given
in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as
contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if
such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08. Promptly
following receipt of any such notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
partial prepayment of any Revolving Borrowing shall be in an amount equal to
$100,000 or a whole multiple thereof. Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing
shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by
Section 2.13.

                  2.12. Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender an annual facility fee (the
"Facility Fee"), calculated at the rate per annum equal to the Facility Fee Rate
on the daily amount of the Commitment of such Lender (whether used or unused)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the
date on which such Commitment terminates; provided that, if such Lender
continues to have any Revolving Credit Exposure after its Commitment terminates,


                                       23
<PAGE>
then such Facility Fee shall continue to accrue on the daily amount of such
Lender's Revolving Credit Exposure from and including the date on which its
Commitment terminates to but excluding the date on which such Lender ceases to
have any Revolving Credit Exposure. Accrued Facility Fees shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of
each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate, commencing on the
first such date to occur after the date hereof; provided that any Facility Fees
accruing after the date on which the Commitments terminate shall be payable on
demand. The Facility Fee shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days
and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day).

                  (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or
the Lead Arranger, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the
times provided in the Fee Letter or as separately agreed upon from time to time
between the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and/or the Lead Arranger.

                  (c) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due,
in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in
the case of Facility Fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

                  2.13. Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing
shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternative Base Rate.

                  (b) The Loans comprising each Swingline Loan shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate.

                  (c) Each Eurocurrency Borrowing shall bear interest, for the
period commencing on the Borrowing Date thereof and ending on the last day of
the Interest Period with respect thereto, on the unpaid principal amount thereof
at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined by the
Administrative Agent for the Interest Period therefor plus the Applicable
Margin.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if any principal of or
interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or
otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before
judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the overdue principal
of any Loan, 2% above the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in
the preceding clauses of this Section or (y) in the case of any other amount, 2%
above the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section, and (ii) during the continuance of a Default and until the same has
been cured, remedied or waived pursuant to Section 9.02, at the request of the
Required Lenders the principal of any Loan not overdue shall bear interest,
after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to 2% above the rate
otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding clauses of this
Section.

                  (e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination of the
Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of
this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior
to the end of the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount
repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment
and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan
prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on
such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.


                                       24
<PAGE>
                  (f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or
Eurocurrency Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  2.14. Alternate Rate of Interest. If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Eurocurrency Borrowing:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
not exist for ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate, for such Interest Period; or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required
Lenders that the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders (or Lender) of making or maintaining
their Loans (or its Loan) included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Eurocurrency Borrowing shall be
ineffective, (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurocurrency Revolving
Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing; provided that if
the circumstances giving rise to such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings,
then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.

                  2.15. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:

                      (i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special
           deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
           for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any
           such reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate); or

                      (ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market
           any other condition affecting this Agreement or Eurocurrency Loans
           made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurocurrency Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

                  (b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if
any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a
level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's
policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender,


                                       25
<PAGE>
as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  (c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case
may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.

                  (d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such
Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

                  2.16. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment
of any principal of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurocurrency Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurocurrency Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.11(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith), (d) the making of
adjustment payments relating to Eurocurrency Loans other than on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable there to with respect to an increase in the Total
Commitment pursuant to Section 2.09, or (e) the assignment of any Eurocurrency
Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a
result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such
event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurocurrency Loan, such loss, cost
or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Eurocurrency Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the
period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the
amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period
at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the
commencement of such period, for Dollar deposits (or, in the case of Loans
denominated in an Optional Currency, deposits in such Optional Currency) of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the Eurocurrency market. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

                  2.17. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without
deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the
Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from
such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent or Lender
receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental
Authority in accordance with applicable law.


                                       26
<PAGE>
                  (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

                  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and
each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount
of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or
on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

                  (e) Any Foreign Lender that is a Non-U.S. Person shall, at the
time or times such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender hereunder (or, in the case of
a Participant that is a Non-U.S. Person, becomes a Participant hereunder),
deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (or, in the case of a
Participant, to the relevant Lender), properly completed originals, as
applicable, of the following: (A) IRS Form W-8ECI (claiming an exemption from
U.S. federal withholding tax because the income at issue is effectively
connected with a U.S. trade or business); (B) in the case of a Foreign Lender
claiming exemption under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, IRS Form W-8BEN
(or any successor form) and a certificate that such Foreign Lender (i) is not a
"bank" for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (ii) is not a ten
percent (10%) shareholder for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code and
(iii) is not a controlled foreign corporation receiving interest from a related
person for purposes of Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, (C) in the case of a
Foreign Lender that is a pass-through entity, or that ceases to act for its own
account with respect to any payments paid to such Foreign Lender hereunder, an
IRS Form W-8IMY (with required supporting documentation), and (D) any other
documentation prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service certifying as to the
entitlement of such Lender to an exemption from United States withholding tax as
to payments to be made to such Lender under this Agreement. Each Lender that is
not a Foreign Lender shall, at the time or times such Lender becomes a Lender
hereunder (or, in the case of a Participant that is a Non-U.S. Person, becomes a
Participant hereunder), deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
(or, in the case of a Participant, to the relevant Lender), properly completed
originals of IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying as to such Person's
eligibility for an exemption from United States federal backup withholding. If
any Lender determines that it is unable to submit any form or certificate
otherwise required under this Section 2.17(e), or that it is required to
withdraw or cancel any such form or certificate, or that any such form or
certificate previously submitted pursuant to this Section 2.17(e) has become
incorrect or ineffective, such Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower or
Administrative Agent of that fact.

                  (f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its
reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the
Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.17, it shall pay
over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments
made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with
respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without


                                       27
<PAGE>
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the request of
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to
the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to
require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns
(or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to
the Borrower or any other Person.

                  (g) The Borrower shall not be obligated to gross up any
payments to any Lender or Administrative Agent, nor to indemnify any Lender or
Administrative Agent, pursuant to this Section 2.17 to the extent that any Taxes
are imposed as a result of the failure of any of the exemption forms delivered
by such Lender or Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.17(e) to establish
a complete exemption from the relevant Tax (other than as a result of a Change
in Law occurring after the Closing Date) or that results from a change in the
branch or lending office of such Lender, provided that the Borrower shall be
obligated to gross up any payments to any such Lender pursuant to Section
2.17(a) and to indemnify any such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(c) in respect
of United States federal withholding Taxes if (i) the redesignation of the
Lender's lending office was made at the request of the Borrower or (ii) the
obligation to gross up payments to any such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(a)
or to indemnify any such Lender pursuant to Section 2.17(c) is with respect to
an assignee Lender that becomes an assignee Lender as a result of an assignment
made at the request of any Borrower.

                  2.18. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
Set-offs. (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or of amounts payable under
Sections 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City
time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 270
Park Avenue, New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 2.15, 2.16 or 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the
next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments
hereunder shall be made in Dollars; provided that payments of principal and
interest in respect of a Loan denominated in an Optional Currency shall be made
in such Optional Currency.

                  (b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first,
towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal then due to such parties.

                  (c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans resulting in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the Dollar Equivalent of the
aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)


                                       28
<PAGE>
participations in the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to
the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by
the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans;
provided that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such
recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not
be construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a
Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph
shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.

                  (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, as the case may be,
the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.

                  (e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to
be made by it pursuant to Sections 2.04(a), 2.05(c), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or
9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding
any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's
obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully
paid.

                  2.19. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If
any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment
of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in
connection with any such designation or assignment.

                  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to


                                       29
<PAGE>
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and
Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts
payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a
claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such
compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such
assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such
Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such
assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

                  The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

                  3.01. Organization; Powers. Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the
failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

                  3.02. Authorization; Enforceability. The Transactions are
within the Borrower's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder action. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium
or other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to general
principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity
or at law.

                  3.03. Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts. The Transactions
(a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with, or
any other action by, any Governmental Authority, except such as have been
obtained or made and are in full force and effect, (b) will not violate any
Requirements of Law applicable to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any
order of any Governmental Authority, (c) will not violate or result in a default
under any Contractual Obligation binding upon the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any
payment to be made by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, and (d) will not
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (c) or (d) violations of
Contractual Obligations and/or incurrence of Liens which would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  3.04. Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change. (a) The
Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet
and statements of income, statements of changes in stockholders equity and
statements of cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2005, reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent public accountants,
and (ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2006, certified by a
Responsible Officer. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position and results of operations and cash flows of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and for such period


                                       30
<PAGE>
in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, subject to the absence of full
footnote disclosure in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii)
above.

                  (b) Except as set forth in the filings of the Borrower with
the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to the date hereof, since December
31, 2005, there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations,
assets, financial or other condition, of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

                  3.05. Properties. (a) Each of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (i) has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its
real and personal property material to its business (except that such
representation is not made for any such property with a book value of $1,000,000
or less provided that the aggregate book value of such property for which such
representation is not made shall not exceed $10,000,000), and (ii) none of such
property is subject to any Lien, except as permitted in Section 6.04, except
(with reference to clauses (i) and (ii)), for minor defects in title or Liens
which in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.

                  (b) Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries owns, or is
licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and other
intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other
Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  3.06. Litigation and Environmental Matters. (a) There are no
actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve this Agreement or the Transactions.

                  (b) Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect
to any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any
Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or
other approval required under any Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to
any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect
to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental
Liability.

                  (c) Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change
in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  3.07. Compliance with Laws and Agreements. Each of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all Requirements of Law
applicable to it or its property and all Contractual Obligations binding upon it
or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. No Default has occurred and is continuing.

                  3.08. Investment and Holding Company Status. The Borrower is
not (a) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under,
the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.


                                       31
<PAGE>
                  3.09. Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports which to the
knowledge of the Borrower or such Subsidiaries are required to be filed and has
paid or caused to be paid all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns
or reports, except (a) Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  3.10. ERISA. No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that, when taken together with all other such ERISA Events for
which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. The present value of all accumulated
benefit obligations of all Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of
the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than the sum of (i) $30,000,000, (ii) the amount of the WilTel Underfunding and
(iii) the amount of the Acquired Entity Underfunding, the fair market value of
the assets of all such Plans.

                  3.11. Disclosure. None of the reports, financial statements,
certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of
this Agreement or delivered hereunder (as modified or supplemented by other
information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that,
with respect to projected financial information, the Borrower represents only
that such information was prepared in good faith based upon assumptions believed
to be reasonable at the time.

                  3.12. Nonrecourse Indebtedness. Schedule 3.12 sets forth the
aggregate outstanding amount on a consolidated basis of the Nonrecourse Debt as
of March 31, 2006.

                  3.13. No Burdensome Restrictions. No Contractual Obligation of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and no Requirement of Law would
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                  3.14. Subsidiaries. The Borrower's annual report to
shareholders on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005, as filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, contains a list of all material
Subsidiaries of the Borrower as of December 31, 2005 that is true, correct and
complete in all material respects. Since December 31, 2005 through the Effective
Date, any new material Subsidiary of the Borrower that has been organized or
acquired (directly or indirectly) by the Borrower has been disclosed in a report
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                  3.15. Federal Regulations. Neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries is engaged or will engage, principally or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of "purchasing"
or "carrying" any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the
quoted terms under Regulations U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System as now and from time to time hereafter in effect. No part of the
proceeds of any Loans hereunder will be used (a) for "purchasing" or "carrying"
"margin stock" as so defined unless (i) the Borrower shall have theretofore
furnished to the Lenders a statement on Federal Reserve Form U-1 with respect to
such Loans or (ii) not more than 25% of the value of the assets of either the
Borrower or the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis,
respectively, is represented by "margin stock" as so defined, or (b) for any
purpose which violates, or which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of
the Regulations of such Board of Governors.

Loans hereunder shall not become effective until the date on which each of the
following conditions is satisfied (or waived in accordance with Section 9.02):

                  (a) The Administrative Agent (or its counsel) shall have

                  (b) The Administrative Agent shall have received a favorable
written opinion (addressed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and dated
the Effective Date) of Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, counsel for the Borrower,
substantially in the form of Exhibit C, and covering such other matters relating
to the Borrower, this Agreement or the Transactions as the Required Lenders
shall reasonably request. The Borrower hereby requests such counsel to deliver
such opinion.

                  (c) The Administrative Agent shall have received such
documents and certificates as the Administrative Agent or its counsel may
reasonably request relating to the organization, existence and good standing of
the Borrower, the authorization of the Transactions and any other legal matters
relating to the Borrower, this Agreement or the Transactions, all in form and
substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel.

                  (d) The Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate, dated the Effective Date and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Borrower, confirming compliance with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)

instruments as are customary for transactions of this type or as they may
reasonably request.

The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the
Effective Date, and such notice shall be conclusive and binding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans hereunder shall not
become effective unless each of the foregoing conditions is satisfied (or waived

being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and the Borrower or
such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect
thereto in accordance with GAAP or (b) the failure to make payment would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; provided that for
purposes of this Section 5.04 the term "Indebtedness" shall not include any

representatives, to visit and inspect any of its properties and examine and make
abstracts from any of its books and records at any reasonable time and as often

independent directors on the board of directors of the Borrower; or, in the
event that at the time of any such transaction or series of related transactions
there are no independent directors serving on the board of directors of the
Borrower, such transaction or series of related transactions shall be approved
by a nationally recognized expert with experience in appraising the terms and
conditions of the type of transaction for which approval is required.

default in the observance or performance of any other agreement or condition
relating to any such Indebtedness or Contingent Obligation or contained in any

                  (g) (i) the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall commence any

unbonded for a period of 60 days; or (iii) there shall be commenced against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary any case, proceeding or other action seeking issuance
of a warrant of attachment, execution, distraint or similar process against all
or any substantial part of its assets which results in the entry of an order for

<PAGE>
                  (h) an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of
the Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have
occurred, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
or

                  (i) one or more judgments or decrees shall be entered against
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries involving in the aggregate a liability
(not paid or fully covered by insurance) of $30,000,000 or more and all such
judgments or decrees shall not have been vacated, discharged, or stayed or
bonded pending appeal within 60 days from the entry thereof;

then, and in every such event (other than an event with respect to the Borrower
described in sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of clause (g) above), and at any time
thereafter during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may,
and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower,
take either or both of the following actions, at the same or different times:
(i) terminate the Commitments, and thereupon the Commitments shall terminate
immediately, and (ii) declare the Loans then outstanding to be due and payable
in whole (or in part, in which case any principal not so declared to be due and
payable may thereafter be declared to be due and payable), and thereupon the
principal of the Loans so declared to be due and payable, together with accrued
interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued
hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
the Borrower; and in case of any event with respect to the Borrower described in
sub-clauses (i), (ii) or (iv) of clause (g) above, the Commitments shall
automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding,
together with accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the
Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable, without
presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Borrower.

                  7.02. Termination. (a) This Agreement shall terminate in the
event (i) Ian Cumming and Joseph Steinberg cease to own, directly or indirectly,
32% or more of the Voting Stock of the Borrower; provided that Messrs. Cumming
and/or Steinberg may cease to own, directly or indirectly, 32% or more of the
Voting Stock of the Borrower if: (A) in the aggregate, they own, directly or
indirectly, at least 23% of the outstanding Voting Stock, and (B)(x) if during
the lifetime of Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg, the aggregate Market Value of the
Voting Stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, is at least $200,000,000 or
(y) if upon the death of either Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg, the aggregate
Market Value of the Voting Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by the survivor
would be at least $100,000,000 or (ii) either Mr. Cumming or Mr. Steinberg
ceases (if as a result of death, effective as provided below) to be a principal
executive officer (which shall include the office of Chairman of the board of
directors) of the Borrower. Such termination shall be immediate if it arises
from any event other than the death of either or both of Ian Cumming and Joseph
Steinberg. If such termination shall arise from the death of either or both of
Ian Cumming and Joseph Steinberg such termination shall take effect 130 days
after such event. Upon any such termination, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for the accounts of the Lenders all amounts owing under
this Agreement. No such termination shall affect any rights acquired by the
Lender under this Agreement prior to or as a result of such termination.

                  (b) For purposes hereof:

                      (i) The term "owned, directly or indirectly" shall be
           deemed to include all Voting Stock received from Mr. Cumming or Mr.
           Steinberg by any member of their respective immediate families or by
           any trust for the benefit of either of them or any member of their
           respective immediate families (a "Recipient"), which Voting Stock is
           held by a Recipient during the lifetime of Mr. Cumming or Mr.
           Steinberg. In determining the number of outstanding Common Shares
           then held by Messrs. Cumming and Steinberg and the total number of
           outstanding Common Shares, there shall be excluded Common Shares
           issued by the Borrower after December 31, 1991, or the conversion


                                       43
<PAGE>
           into or exchange for, after December 31, 1991, Common Shares or
           securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares.

                      (ii) The term "Market Price" shall mean, with reference to
           the Borrower's common stock ("Common Shares") for any Trading Day,
           the last reported sale price of a Common Share as reported on the New
           York Stock Exchange or on any principal stock exchange on which the
           Common Shares are then listed or admitted to trading or on the
           National Association of Securities Dealers National Market System, if
           quoted; or, if the Common Shares are not then listed or admitted to
           trading on any national securities exchange and there is no reported
           last sale price or bid and asked prices available, the average of the
           reported high-bid and low-asked prices on such day as reported by a
           reputable quotation service or a newspaper of general circulation in
           the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, customarily
           published on each business day; or, in the absence of one or more
           such quotations, the current market price determined in good faith by
           the board of directors of the Borrower on the basis of such
           quotations or factors as it deems appropriate.

                      (iii) The term "Market Value" shall mean, with reference
           to the Borrower's Common Shares, the average Market Price of such
           Common Shares for the twenty Trading Days immediately preceding the
           date of the sale, transfer or disposition giving rise to the need to
           determine Market Value.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                            The Administrative Agent

                  Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the
Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to
take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.

                  The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender
and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and
such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or
other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

                  The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
obligations except those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except
as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that is
communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any
of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable
for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of
the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall
be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default other than a payment


                                       44
<PAGE>
Default, unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative
Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement,
warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii)
the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any
other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

                  The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and
shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed
by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The
Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not
incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult
with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such
counsel, accountants or experts.

                  The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties
and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

                  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor.
Unless a Default then exists, such successor shall be reasonably acceptable to
the Borrower. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required
Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York,
or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the
Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

                  Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and
without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its


                                       45
<PAGE>
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

                  The Lead Arranger shall have no duties, responsibilities or
obligations to, no authority to act for, any other party to this Agreement by
virtue of its status as Lead Arranger hereunder.

<PAGE>
                  9.02. Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Borrower
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not
be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent, any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

                  (b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without
the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan
or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest
thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv)
change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, or (v)
change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required
Lenders" or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the
Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be.

                  9.03. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Borrower
shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent or the Lead Arranger, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arranger, in connection with the syndication of the Revolving Loans provided for
herein, the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of this
Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated), and (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent, or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any
counsel for the Administrative Agent, or any Lender, in connection with the
enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement,
including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans issued
hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans.

                  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Lead Arranger and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by
the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation


                                       47
<PAGE>
of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan
or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any actual or alleged presence or
release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in
any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

                  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent, or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such
Lender's Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent, or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as
such.

                  (d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

                  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable
promptly following written demand therefor.

                  9.04. Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i)
the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be
null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

                  (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph
(b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) of:

                      (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower
           shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
           Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and
           is continuing, any other assignee;


                                       48
<PAGE>
                      (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of
           the Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of any
           Commitment to an assignee that is a Lender with a Commitment
           immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment; and

                      (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following
           additional conditions:

                      (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
           Affiliate of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount
           of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the
           amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to
           each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
           Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
           Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $2,500,000 unless each
           of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent;
           provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an
           Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

                      (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment
           of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
           obligations under this Agreement; provided that this clause shall not
           be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of
           all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one
           Class of Commitments or Loans;

                      (C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and
           deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,
           together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

                      (D) the assignee, if it shall not have been a Lender prior
           to the effective date of such assignment, shall deliver to the
           Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire in which the
           assignee designates one or more credit contacts to whom all
           syndicate-level information (which may contain material non-public
           information about the Borrower and its related parties or its
           securities) will be made available and who may receive such
           information in accordance with the assignee's compliance procedures
           and applicable laws, including Federal and state securities laws.

                  For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term "Approved
Fund" has the following meaning:

                  "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and
similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is
administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an
entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

                      (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant
           to paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective
           date specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee
           thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
           assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and
           obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
           Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
           such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
           under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
           Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
           obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
           party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
           Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a
           Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not


                                       49
<PAGE>
           comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this
           Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights
           and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

                      (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as
           an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy
           of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for
           the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
           Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each
           Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
           "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
           Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each
           Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
           hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
           notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
           available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any
           reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

                      (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and
           Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
           assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the
           assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
           recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any
           written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this
           Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
           Assumption and record the information contained therein in the
           Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the
           assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by
           it pursuant to Sections 2.04(a), 2.05(c), 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or
           9.03(c), the Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to accept
           such Assignment and Assumption and record the information therein in
           the Register unless and until such payment shall have been made in
           full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment shall
           be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
           recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

                  (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or
more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender's
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of
this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a
Lender.

                      (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any
           greater payment under Sections 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable
           Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
           participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the
           participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior
           written consent to such greater payment. A Participant that would be
           a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
           benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower is notified of the


                                       50
<PAGE>
           participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees,
           for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as
           though it were a Lender.

                      (iii) Each Lender that sells a Participation to a
           Participant shall, as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, keep a
           register of each Participant, specifying such Participant's
           entitlement to payments of principal and interest pursuant to such
           Participation. The entries in such register shall be conclusive, and
           each Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in such
           register as a Participant, unless it receives notice to the contrary.

                  (d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section
shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release
a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                  (e) On one or more occasions, one or more Additional Lenders
may be admitted as Lenders party to this Agreement in connection with an
increase of the Total Commitment pursuant to Section 2.09, subject to (i)
execution and delivery by any such Additional Lender to the Administrative
Agent, for recording in the Register, of an Instrument of Adherence
substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto (an "Instrument of Adherence"),
(ii) acceptance of such Instrument of Adherence by each of the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower by their respective executions thereof, and (iii) the
completion of an Administrative Questionnaire by such Additional Lender promptly
delivered to the Administrative Agent. Upon the satisfaction of the foregoing
conditions, from and after the effective date specified in each such Instrument
of Adherence, which effective date shall be at least five Business Days after
the execution thereof, the Additional Lender shall be a Lender party hereto and
have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder.

                  9.05. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty
at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force
and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or
any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and so
long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of
Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in
full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans and the Commitments or the
termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

                  9.06. Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement
may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any
separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative
Agent or the Lead Arranger constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and


                                       51
<PAGE>
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

                  9.07. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

                  9.08. Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

                  9.09. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
Process. (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
by the law of the State of New York.

                  (b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the
United States District Court of the Southern District of New York sitting in New
York County, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such New York State or, to the extent
permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement against the Borrower or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

                  (c) The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court
referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

                  (d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

                  9.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES,
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER


                                       52
<PAGE>
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

                  9.11. Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of
Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

                  9.12. Confidentiality. (a) Each of the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as
defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its
Affiliates' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by
applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d)
to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing
provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee
of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of
its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective
counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to
the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a
result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower. For the purposes of
this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower or
a Subsidiary of the Borrower relating to the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the
Borrower or their businesses, other than any such information that is available
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided that, in
the case of information received from the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the
Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the
time of delivery as confidential. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

                  (b) EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION AS DEFINED IN
SECTION 9.12(A) FURNISHED TO IT PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY INCLUDE MATERIAL
NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BORROWER AND ITS RELATED PARTIES OR THEIR
RESPECTIVE SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES
REGARDING THE USE OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION AND THAT IT WILL HANDLE
SUCH MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE PROCEDURES AND
APPLICABLE LAW, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

                  (c) ALL INFORMATION, INCLUDING REQUESTS FOR WAIVERS AND
AMENDMENTS, FURNISHED BY THE BORROWER OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT PURSUANT TO,
OR IN THE COURSE OF ADMINISTERING, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE SYNDICATE-LEVEL


                                       53
<PAGE>
INFORMATION, WHICH MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE
BORROWER AND ITS RELATED PARTIES OR ITS SECURITIES. ACCORDINGLY, EACH LENDER
REPRESENTS TO THE BORROWER AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT THAT IT HAS IDENTIFIED
IN ITS ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONNAIRE A CREDIT CONTACT WHO MAY RECEIVE INFORMATION
THAT MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS
COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES AND APPLICABLE LAW.

                  9.13. USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into
law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act") hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to
the requirements of the Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name
and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to
identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.
