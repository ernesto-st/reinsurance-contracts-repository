                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into
effective as of the 19th day of January, 2001 by and among HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("HCC"), HCC Employee Benefits, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of HCC ("Merger Sub," Merger
Sub and HCC are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the "Purchasers");
James Scott Schanen ("Schanen"), Lisa Rae Schanen ("LRS"), Connor Schanen qsst
("Connor"), Austin Schanen qsst ("Austin") and Kevin Tolbert ("Tolbert")
(Schanen, LRS, Connor, Austin, and Tolbert being herein sometimes collectively
called the "Shareholders" or the "Sellers"); and Schanen Consulting Corporation,
a Georgia corporation ("SCC" which, unless the context otherwise requires,
includes its predecessor and subsidiary, The Schanen Consulting Group, LLC).
Sellers and Purchasers are sometimes referred to herein as the "Parties."

                                    RECITALS:

         A. The Boards of Directors of each of HCC, Merger Sub and SCC have
determined to engage in a transaction pursuant to which (i) SCC will merge with
and into Merger Sub (the "Merger") in accordance with the laws of the State of
Georgia and the State of Delaware and the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) at
the Effective Time (as defined herein) the capital stock of SCC (the "SCC Common
Stock") shall be converted into shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of HCC (the "HCC Common Stock") in the manner herein described, all upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

         B. The Board of Directors of SCC has approved and has resolved, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, to recommend that shareholders of SCC approve
the Merger, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger (as defined herein) in
accordance with Georgia law.

         C. The Board of Directors of HCC has approved the Merger, this
Agreement and the Articles of Merger. HCC, as the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub, has approved the Merger, this Agreement and the Articles of Merger in
accordance with Delaware law.

         D. The parties intend for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to qualify as a plan of reorganization in accordance with the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and to be accounted for as a "pooling-of-interests" for accounting
purposes.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the
parties hereto do hereby agree as follows:



                                      1

                                  ARTICLE 1
                                 THE MERGER

         SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SCC will be
merged with and into Merger Sub in accordance with the laws of the State of
Georgia ("Georgia Law") and the laws of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"),
whereupon the separate existence of SCC shall cease, and Merger Sub shall be the
surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

         (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, SCC and Merger Sub
shall (i) file articles of merger, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit "A-1" (the "Articles of Merger"), in the Office of the Secretary of the
State of Georgia, and make all such other filings or recordings required by
Georgia Law and as required by the Georgia Business Corporation Act in
connection with the Merger and (ii) file a certificate of merger, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A-2" (the "Certificate of
Merger"), in the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and
make all such other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law and as
required by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). The Merger shall
become effective upon completion of the filing of the Articles of Merger with
the Office of the Secretary of the State of Georgia and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the office of the Secretary of State of Delaware, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Georgia Law or Delaware Law, as
applicable (the "Effective Time"). The date on which the Effective Time shall
occur is referred to herein as the "Effective Date."

         (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all
of the restrictions, disabilities and duties of SCC and Merger Sub, all as
provided under Georgia Law or Delaware Law, as applicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time (i) all
the rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, of a public as well
as of a private nature, and all property, real, personal and mixed, and all
debts due on whatever account, including without limitation subscriptions to
shares, and all other choses in action, and all and every other interest of or
belongings to or due to the Merger Sub or SCC shall be taken and deemed to be
transferred to, and vested in, the Surviving Corporation without further act or
deed; and all property, rights and privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as effectually
the property of the Surviving Corporation, as they were of Merger Sub and SCC,
and (ii) all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of Merger Sub and SCC,
subject to the terms hereof, shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall thenceforth be
responsible and liable for all the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of
Merger Sub and SCC, and neither the rights of creditors nor any liens upon the
property of Merger Sub or SCC shall be impaired by the Merger, and may be
enforced against the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.2 CONVERSION OF STOCK. At the Effective Time, each share of
SCC Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof cease to
be outstanding and be converted into the right to receive 797.44 shares of HCC
Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

         No fractional shares shall be issued and each holder of SCC Common
Stock shall be entitled to the nearest whole share of HCC Common Stock rounded
upwards if such fractional share exceeds 0.5 and otherwise rounded downwards,
provided, however, that HCC shall under no circumstances be obligated hereunder
to issue shares of HCC Common Stock in excess of an aggregate of 996,800 shares
of HCC Common Stock.

         Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and
outstanding as one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         SECTION 1.3 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

         (a) As of the Effective Time, all shares of SCC Common Stock other than
shares of SCC Common Stock held by Stockholders ("Dissenting Shareholders") duly
exercising appraisal rights pursuant to Georgia Law ("Dissenting Shares") that
are outstanding immediately prior thereto will, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action, cease to exist, and all such shares of SCC Common Stock
will be converted into the right to receive from HCC the number of shares of HCC
Common Stock determined as set forth in Section 1.2 hereof.

         (b) At and after the Effective Time, each certificate representing
outstanding shares of SCC Common Stock will represent the number of shares of
HCC Common Stock into which such shares of SCC Common Stock are converted and
such shares of HCC Common Stock will be deemed registered in the name of the
holder of such certificate. At the Effective Time, each holder of shares of SCC
Common Stock will surrender the certificates for such shares (the "SCC
Certificates") to HCC for cancellation. Promptly following the Effective Time
and receipt of the SCC Certificates, HCC will cause to be issued to such
surrendering holder certificates for the number of shares of HCC Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to the terms hereof. Shares of SCC Common
Stock held by Dissenting Shareholders shall thereafter represent the right to
require the Surviving Corporation to purchase such shares of SCC Common stock
for their "fair value" as determined in accordance with Georgia Law.

         (c) All shares of HCC Common Stock delivered upon the surrender of SCC
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be delivered to the
registered holder. After the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers of the shares of SCC Common Stock on the stock
transfer books of SCC. If, after the Effective Time, SCC Certificates are
presented for transfer or for any other reason, they will be canceled and
exchanged and certificates therefor will be delivered as provided for herein.



                                       3
<PAGE>   8
         (d) Until SCC Certificates representing SCC Common Stock outstanding
prior to the Merger are surrendered pursuant to this Section 1.3, such
certificates will be deemed, for all purposes, to evidence ownership of the
number of whole shares of HCC Common Stock into which the shares of SCC Common
Stock will have been converted.

         (e) If prior to the Merger, HCC recapitalizes either through a split-up
of its outstanding shares into a greater number, or through a combination of its
outstanding shares into a lesser number, or reorganizes, reclassifies or
otherwise changes its outstanding shares into the same or a different number of
shares of other classes, or declares a dividend on its outstanding shares
payable in shares or securities convertible into shares (but not cash), the
number of shares of HCC Common Stock into which the shares of SCC Common Stock
are to be converted will be adjusted in proportion to such change.

         SECTION 1.4 ESCROW. Pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to be entered into
on or before the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) in substantially the form
of Exhibit 1.4 (the "Escrow Agreement"), among HCC, each of the Shareholders and
First Union National Bank as escrow agent, HCC will withhold for a period of 36
months following the Closing Date, an amount equal to 10% of the Merger
Consideration (the "Escrow Amount"). On the Closing Date, HCC will deposit, or
cause to be deposited in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the number of
shares representing the Escrow Amount. The Escrow Amount shall be provided by
each of the Shareholders in an amount equal to 10% of the number of shares such
Shareholder will receive upon the consummation of the Merger. The Escrow Amount
will be held as collateral for the indemnification obligations of the
Shareholders pending its release from escrow in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.

         SECTION 1.5 DISSENTERS' RIGHTS. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall be
entitled to require SCC to purchase such Shareholders' shares for their "fair
value" as provided in Section 14-2-1302 of the Georgia Business Corporation
Code, SCC shall give HCC notice thereof, and HCC shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Neither SCC nor the Surviving Corporation shall, except with the prior
written consent of HCC, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or offer
to settle, any such demand for payment. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail
to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the right to dissent, the
shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be entitled to be
surrendered in exchange for HCC Common Stock as provided by Section 1.3 hereof.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                            THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

         SECTION 2.1 CERTIFICATES OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS

         Except as otherwise set forth with appropriate section references in
the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, each of which exception shall specifically
identify or cross reference to provisions of this Article 3 to which such
exception relates, and in order to induce Purchasers to enter into and perform
this Agreement, and the Operative Agreements (as herein defined) each of the
Sellers represent and warrant to Purchasers as of the date of this Agreement and
as of the Closing Date as follows:

         SECTION 3.1 CORPORATE EXISTENCE AND POWER. SCC is a corporation duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the state of Georgia, and has
all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals (collectively, "Governmental Authorizations") required to
carry on its business as now conducted, except such Governmental Authorizations
the failure of which to have obtained would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
as hereinafter defined, on SCC. Sellers have delivered to Purchasers true and
complete copies of SCC's Articles or Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as
currently in effect. SCC is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Material Adverse Effect," with respect to any person or entity, means a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise), business,
properties, assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities), results of
operations or prospects of such person or entity; provided, however, that a
Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change in general economic
conditions or changes that affect a person or entity's industry generally; and
"Material Adverse Change" means a change or a development involving a
prospective change which is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

         SECTION 3.2 AUTHORIZATION. Each Seller represents and warrants that
such Seller has full right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and
each other agreement to be entered into by such Seller in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Operative Agreements") and that this
Agreement and such Operative Agreements constitute, or upon execution will
constitute, valid and binding agreements of such Seller, enforceable against
such Seller in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency



                                       5
<PAGE>   10

or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally
or by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding of equity or at law.

         SECTION 3.3 GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Sellers of this Agreement and the Operative
Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder require no action by any of the Sellers or any filing by them with
any governmental body, agency, official or authority other than in respect of:

         (a) compliance with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder;

         (b) compliance with any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue
sky" laws;

         (c) compliance with any requirements of any federal, state, foreign or
other insurance or reinsurance or intermediaries, or agent or managing general
agent or third party administrators' laws, including licensing or other related
laws;

         (d) Compliance with any applicable requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE"); or

         (e) such other filings or registrations with, or authorizations,
consents or approvals of, governmental bodies, agencies, officials or
authorities, the failure of which to make or obtain (i) would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC, or (ii) would not materially
adversely affect the ability of either of SCC or Purchasers to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to operate their businesses as heretofore
operated.

         SECTION 3.4 NON-CONTRAVENTION. The execution, delivery and performance
by each of the Sellers of this Agreement and the Operative Agreements, and the
consummation by each of the Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not:

         (a) contravene or conflict with SCC's Articles or Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws;

         (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 3.3,
contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of any provision of any
law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon or
applicable to the Sellers;

         (c) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of, or constitute
a default under, or result in a contractual right to cause the termination or
cancellation of or loss of



                                       6

a material benefit under, or right to accelerate, any material agreement,
contract or other instrument binding upon SCC or any material license,

         (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (as hereinafter
defined) on any material asset of SCC; or

         (e) invalidate or adversely affect any permit, license or authorization
or status used in connection with SCC's business;

except, with respect to clauses (b), (c) and (d) above, for contraventions,
defaults, losses, Liens and other matters referred to in such clauses that would
not be reasonably expected to have individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on SCC. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Lien" means,
with respect to any asset, any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest
or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset.

         SECTION 3.5 CAPITALIZATION.

         (a) As of the date of this Agreement, the authorized capital stock of
SCC consists of 100,000 shares of a single class designated as common stock,
1,250 shares of which are issued and outstanding. All of such outstanding shares
are owned by the Shareholders free of any Liens or other encumbrances in the
amounts set forth on Schedule 3.5 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule.

         (b) All outstanding shares of SCC have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and free from any preemptive rights.
Except as set forth in and as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, for SCC
there are outstanding (i) no shares of capital stock or other voting securities,
(ii) no securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of its capital
stock or voting securities, (iii) no options or other rights to acquire, and no
obligation to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for its capital stock or other voting
securities (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this subsection (b)
being referred to collectively as the "SCC Securities"), (iv) no obligations to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any SCC Securities, and (v) no
contractual rights of any person or entity to include any SCC Securities in any

         SECTION 3.6 SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES.

         (a) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Subsidiary" means, with
respect to any entity, any corporation of which securities or other ownership
interests having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of
directors or other persons performing similar functions are directly or
indirectly owned by such entity, and (ii) "Joint Venture" means, with respect to
any entity, any corporation or organization (other than such entity and any
Subsidiary thereof) of which such entity or any Subsidiary thereof is, directly
or indirectly, the beneficial owner of 25% or more of any class of equity
securities or equivalent profit participation interest.

         (b) As of the date hereof SCC owns all of the membership interests
("Interests") in The Schanen Consulting Group, LLC ("LLC") and no person or
entity is entitled to acquire any Interests in LLC nor are there any securities
exchangeable or convertible into such Interests, and LLC is not required to
redeem or repurchase any Interests. Except for such ownership of LLC, SCC does
not have any Subsidiary and is not a party to any Joint Venture.

         SECTION 3.7 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Sellers have delivered to Purchasers
the audited balance sheets as of December 31, 1999, and unaudited balance sheets
for December 31, 1998, and December 31, 1997, audited income statements for the
annual period ended December 31, 1999, and unaudited income statements for the
annual periods ending December 31, 1998, and December 31, 1997 and unaudited
balance sheets and income statements for the period as of or ending September
30, 2000 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Balance Sheet Date" shall mean December 31, 1999, unless the
Effective Date is later than January 30, 2001, in which case it shall mean
December 31, 2000. The Financial Statements present fairly in all material
respects, substantially in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied (except as indicated in the notes thereto), the
financial position of SCC as of the dates thereof and results of operations and
cash flows for the periods therein indicated (subject to normal year-end
adjustments in the case of any interim financial statements and the absence of
certain footnotes in the case of unaudited financial statements). SCC does not
have any material debt, liability or obligation of any nature, whether accrued,

reflected, reserved against or disclosed in the Financial Statements except for
(i) those that are not required to be reported in accordance with the aforesaid
accounting principles; (ii) normal or recurring liabilities incurred since
December 31, 1999 in the ordinary course of business or (iii) as disclosed in

         SECTION 3.8 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Since December 31, 1999, SCC
has in all material respects conducted its business in the ordinary course and
there has not been:

         (a) any Material Adverse Change with respect thereto or any event,
occurrence or development of a state of circumstances or facts known to any of
the



                                       8
<PAGE>   13

would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC;

         (f) any increase in indebtedness for borrowed money or capitalized
lease obligations of SCC, except in the ordinary course of business;

         (g) any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any tangible
or intangible asset material to the business of SCC, except in the ordinary
course of business and for a fair and adequate consideration;

         (h) any amendment, termination or waiver by SCC of any right of
substantial value under any agreement, contract or other written commitment to
which it is a party or by which it is bound which could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on SCC;

or properties of SCC;

         (j) any (i) grant of any severance or termination pay to any director,

agreement) with any director, officer or employee of SCC other than the
Non-Competition Agreements contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any increase in
benefits payable under any existing severance or termination pay policies or
employment agreements, or (iv) any increase in compensation, bonus or other

                                       9

financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999
(including the notes thereto) of SCC;

         (b) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since December 31, 1999; or

         (c) liabilities under this Agreement or indicated in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule.

         SECTION 3.10 ACCOUNTING MATTERS. Neither SCC nor any of the
Shareholders has taken or agreed to take any action that (without giving effect
to any action taken or agreed to be taken by HCC or any of its affiliates) would
prevent HCC from accounting for the business combination to be effected by the
Merger as a pooling-of-interests.

         SECTION 3.11 LITIGATION. Other than actions, suits, proceedings, claims
or investigations occurring in the ordinary course of business involving
respective amounts in controversy of less than $10,000 each and $20,000 in the
aggregate, there is no action, suit, proceeding, claim or investigation pending
against, nor has SCC or any Seller received notice of a claim threatened against
SCC or any of its assets or against or involving any of its officers, directors
or employees in connection with the business or



                                       10
<PAGE>   15

affairs of SCC, including, without limitation, any such claims for
indemnification arising under any agreement to which SCC is a party. SCC has not
received notice that it is subject, or in default with respect, to any writ,
order, judgment, injunction or decree which could, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.12 TAXES.

         (a) SCC and LLC (i) have filed when due (taking into account
extensions) with the appropriate federal, state, local, foreign and other
governmental agencies, all tax returns, estimates and reports required to be
filed by it, (ii) either paid when due and payable or established adequate
reserves or otherwise accrued on the Financial Statements all federal. state,
local or foreign taxes, levies, imposts, duties, licenses and registration fees
and charges of any nature whatsoever, and unemployment and social security taxes
and income tax withholding, including interest and penalties thereon (each
individually a "Tax" and collectively the "Taxes") and there are no tax
deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority that, in the aggregate,
would result in any tax liability in excess of the amount of the reserves or
accruals and (iii) has or will establish in accordance with its normal
accounting practices and procedures accruals and reserves that, in the
aggregate, are adequate for the payment of all Taxes not yet due and payable and
attributable to any period preceding the Effective Date. The Sellers Disclosure
Schedule sets forth those tax returns for all periods that currently are the
subject of audit or extension by any federal, state, local or foreign taxing
authority.

         (b) There are no Taxes, interest, penalties, assessments or
deficiencies claimed in writing by any taxing authority to be due in respect of
any tax returns filed by SCC (or any predecessor corporations). Neither SCC nor
any predecessor corporation or entity, has executed or filed with the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") or any other taxing authority any agreement or other
document extending, or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment
or collection of any Taxes.

         (c) SCC is not a party to nor bound by (or will prior to the Effective
Date become a party to or bound by) any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax

affiliated group or filed or been included in a combined, consolidated or
unitary Tax return.

         (d) SCC has maintained a valid S election pursuant to the Code since
its incorporation and there is no corporate income tax due from SCC.

         SECTION 3.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS, ERISA.

         (a) SCC is not a party to any oral or written (i) employment,
severance, collective bargaining or consulting agreement not terminable on 60
days' or less notice, (ii) agreement with any executive officer or other key
employee (A) the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving SCC of the
nature of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) providing
any term of employment or compensation guarantee extending



                                       11
<PAGE>   16

for a period longer than one year, or (C) providing severance benefits or other
benefits after the termination of employment of such executive officer or key
employee regardless of the reason for such termination of employment, (iii)
agreement, plan or arrangement under which any person may receive payments
subject to the tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, or (iv) agreement or
plan, including, without limitation, any stock option plan, stock appreciation
right plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan, the benefits of which
would be increased, or the vesting of benefits of which will be accelerated, by
the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         (b) Neither SCC nor any corporation or other entity which under Section
4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA"), is under common control with SCC (an "ERISA Affiliate") maintains or
within the past five years has maintained, contributed to, or been obligated to
contribute to, any "Employee Pension Benefit Plan" ("Pension Plan") or any
"Employee Welfare Benefit Plan" ("Welfare Plan") as such terms are defined in
Sections 3(2) and 3(l) respectively of ERISA, which is subject to ERISA, except
as described on Schedule 3.13(b). Each Pension Plan and Welfare Plan disclosed
in Schedule 3.13(b) and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (which Plans have been
heretofore delivered to Purchasers) and maintained by SCC has been maintained in
all material respects in compliance with their terms and all provisions of ERISA
and the Code (including rules and regulations thereunder) applicable thereto.

         (c) No Pension Plan or Welfare Plan is currently subject to an audit or
other investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor (the "DOL"), the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other governmental agency or office nor are
any such Plans subject to any lawsuits or legal proceedings of any kind or to
any material pending disputed claims by employees or beneficiaries covered under
any such Plan or by any other parties.

         (d) No "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, resulting in liability to SCC or any ERISA Affiliate
has occurred with respect to any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan. None of the
Sellers has any knowledge of any breach of fiduciary responsibility under Part 4
of Title I of ERISA which may result in liability of SCC or any ERISA Affiliate,
any trustee, administrator or fiduciary of any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan.

         (e) Neither SCC nor any ERISA Affiliate, since January 1, 1986, has
maintained or contributed to, or been obligated or required to contribute to, a
"Multiemployer Plan," as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA.
Neither SCC nor any ERISA Affiliate has either withdrawn, partially or
completely, or instituted steps to withdraw, partially or completely, from any
Multiemployer Plan nor has any event occurred which would enable a Multiemployer
Plan to give notice of and demand payment of any withdrawal liability with
respect to SCC or any ERISA Affiliate.



                                       12
<PAGE>   17
         (f) There is no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement covering any
employee or former employee of SCC or any ERISA Affiliate that, individually or
collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be
deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections 162(a)(1) or 280G of the Code.

         (g) With respect to either of SCC and each ERISA Affiliate. Schedule
3.13(b) and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule correctly identifies each material
agreement, policy, plan or other arrangement, whether written or oral, express
or implied, fixed or contingent, to which SCC is a party or by which SCC or any
property or asset of SCC is bound, which is or relates to a pension, option,
bonus, deferred compensation, retirement, stock purchase, profit-sharing,
severance pay, health, welfare, incentive, vacation, sick leave, medical
disability, hospitalization, life or other insurance or fringe benefit plan,
policy or arrangement. Each such agreement, policy, plan or other arrangement
has been maintained in all material respects in compliance with its terms and
all provisions of ERISA and the Code (including rules and regulations
thereunder) applicable thereto.

         (h) Neither SCC nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or has maintained or
contributed to any Pension Plan that is or was subject to Section 302 of Title
IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Sellers have made available to
Purchasers, for each Pension Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, a copy of the most recent determination
letter issued by the IRS to the effect that each such Plan is so qualified and
that each trust created thereunder is tax exempt under Section 501 of the Code,
and each of the Sellers is unaware of any fact or circumstances that would
jeopardize the qualified status of each such Pension Plan or the tax exempt
status of each trust created thereunder.

         (i) One or more of the benefit plans of SCC listed in the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule may be subject to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"). If so, each such plan has been
operated in, and is in compliance with COBRA. All notices required to be given
under COBRA have been timely and properly given in accordance with COBRA, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and no employee, former
employee or "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in COBRA) has any claim or
contingent claim against SCC or any ERISA Affiliate. SCC does not provide
retiree benefits of any kind, including health, medical, life, etc. and SCC has
not agreed to continue any employee benefits after termination of employment
other than COBRA.

         SECTION 3.14 MATERIAL AGREEMENTS.

         (a) The Sellers Disclosure Schedule includes a complete and accurate
list of all contracts, agreements, leases (other than Property Leases, as
hereinafter defined), and instruments to which SCC is a party or by which it or
its properties or assets are bound (1) which individually involve net payments
or receipts in excess of $10,000 per annum, inclusive of contracts entered into
with customers and suppliers in the ordinary course of business, or (2) that
pertain to employment or severance benefits for any officer, director or
employee of SCC, whether written or oral, but exclusive of contracts,
agreements,



                                       13
<PAGE>   18

leases and instruments terminable without penalty upon 60 days' or less prior
written notice to the other party or parties thereto, or (3) to which any of the
Shareholders is the opposing contracting party (the "Material Agreements").

         (b) Neither SCC nor, to the knowledge of any of the Sellers, any other
party is in default under any Material Agreement and no event has occurred which
(after notice or lapse of time or both) would become a breach or default under,
or would permit modification, cancellation, acceleration or termination of, any
Material Agreement or result in the creation of any security interest upon, or
any person obtaining any right to acquire, any properties, assets or rights of
SCC, which, in any such case, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) To the knowledge of each of the Sellers, each such Material
Agreement is in full force and effect and is valid and legally binding and there
are no unresolved disputes involving or with respect to any Material Agreement.
No party to a Material Agreement has advised SCC that it intends either to
terminate a Material Agreement or to refuse to renew a Material Agreement upon
the expiration of the term thereof. No representation or warranty is made that
all benefits contemplated in the Material Agreements will be received.

         (d) SCC is not in violation of, or in default with respect to, any term
of its Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.

         (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.14 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule, SCC has no:

             (1) noncompetition agreement or other arrangement that would
         prevent SCC from carrying on its business anywhere in the world;

             (2) material dispute with any of its suppliers, customers, or
         distributors;

             (3) joint venture contracts, arrangements or any other agreement
         that involves the sharing of profits with any other person; or

             (4) agreements or commitments to provide indemnification.

         SECTION 3.15 PROPERTIES. SCC does not own any real estate, and all
leases of real property to which SCC is a party or by which it is bound
("Property Leases") are in full force and effect and are set forth in Sellers
Disclosure Schedule. There exists no default under such Property Leases, nor any
event (other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) which with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default thereunder. All of
the properties and assets which are owned by SCC are owned free and clear of any
Lien, except for Liens which do not have a Material Adverse Effect. SCC has good
and indefeasible title subject to no Liens, other than those permitted under
this Section 3.15, to all of the properties and assets necessary for the



                                       14
<PAGE>   19

conduct of its business other than to the extent that the failure to have such
title would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

         (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the
following meanings:

             "Environmental Laws" shall mean any and all federal, state, local

         injunctions. permits, concessions, grants, franchises, licenses.

         processing, distribution, use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport
         or handling of pollutants, contaminants, Hazardous Substances or wastes

         SECTION 5.12 NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY.
Schanen and Tolbert agree as follows:

         (a) During the period of three (3) years after the termination
("Employment Termination") of their respective employment with HCC, SCC or any
of their successors, affiliates or subsidiaries (collectively, the "Employer"),
Schanen or Tolbert shall not for any reason, within any of the markets in which
Employer or its affiliates has sold products or services or formulated a plan to
sell products or services into a market during the last twelve (12) months of
their respective employment, as the case may be, engage in or contribute their
knowledge to any work which is competitive with or similar to a product,
process, apparatus, service, or development on which the person in question
worked or with respect to which such person had access to Confidential
Information while employed by Employer. Following the expiration of said three
(3) year period, Schanen and Tolbert each shall continue to be obligated under
the Confidential Information set forth in paragraph (d) of this Section not to
use or to disclose Confidential Information of Employer so long as it shall not
be publicly available. It is understood that the geographical area set forth in
this covenant is divisible so that if this clause is invalid or unenforceable in
an included geographic area, that area is severable and the clause remains in
effect for the remaining included geographic areas in which the clause is valid.

         (b) That for a period of three (3) years after their respective
Employment Termination, neither will solicit or accept any business from any
customer or client or prospective customer or client with whom he dealt or
solicited while employed by Employer.

         (c) For a period of three (3) years after their respective Employment
Termination, neither will either directly or indirectly, on his own behalf or on
behalf of others, solicit, attempt to hire, or hire any person employed by
Employer to work for him or for another entity, firm, corporation, or
individual.

         (d) Neither Schanen nor Tolbert will, except as Employer may otherwise
consent or direct in writing, reveal or disclose, sell, use, lecture upon,
publish or otherwise disclose to any third party any Confidential Information,
or authorize anyone else to do these things at any time either during or
subsequent to his employment. This paragraph shall continue in full force and
effect after termination of Schanen or Tolbert's employment. Schanen and
Tolbert's obligations under this paragraph with respect to any specific
Confidential Information shall cease when that specific portion of the
Confidential Information becomes publicly known, in its entirety and without
combining portions of such information obtained separately. It is understood
that such Confidential Information of Employer include matters that Schanen and
Tolbert conceive or develop, as well as matters Schanen and Tolbert learn from
other employees of Employer. Confidential Information is defined to include
information: (1) disclosed to or known by Schanen or Tolbert, as applicable, as
a consequence of or through his employment with SCC; (2) not generally known
outside of Employer; and (3) which relates to any aspect of Employer or its

Employer's trade secrets, proprietary information, financial documents, long
range plans, customer lists, employer compensation, marketing strategy, existing
contracts and contractual forms and terms, data bases, costing data, computer
software developed by Employer, investments made by Employer, and any
information provided to Employer by a third party under restrictions against
disclosure or use by Employer or others.

         (e) Upon termination of his employment with Employer, Schanen or
Tolbert, if requested by Employer, shall reaffirm in writing his recognition of
the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of Employer's Confidential
Information and proprietary information, and reaffirm any other obligations set
forth in this Agreement.

         (f) Neither Schanen nor Tolbert has used or disclosed any Confidential
Information he may have obtained from Employer prior to signing this Agreement,
in any way inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.

         (g) Any breach of paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above cannot be remedied
solely by money damages, and that in addition to any other remedies Employer may
have, Employer shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against Schanen or
Tolbert, as the case may be. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed as
limiting Employer's right to pursue any other available remedy at law or in
equity, including recovery of damages.

         (h) In the event either of Schanen or Tolbert breaches paragraphs (a),
(b) or (c) of this Section, the restrictive time periods contained in those
provisions will be extended by the period of time he was in violation of such
provisions.

         (i) The agreements contained in this Section are independent of the
other agreements contained herein. Accordingly, failure of Employer to comply
with any of its obligations outside of this Section do not excuse Schanen and
Tolbert from complying with the agreements contained herein.

         (b) By Purchasers or by the Shareholders if there has been a material
breach by the other of any representation or warranty contained in this

under Section 10.1 is in addition to any other rights it may have under this

except that the obligations in Section 7.7, Section 13.3, Section 13.5, Section
13.6 and Section 13.11 will survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement

terminating Party's right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.

Shareholder, jointly and severally (the "Indemnifying Parties") to the extent
hereinafter set forth, covenants and agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and
hold harmless HCC, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, assigns, successors and
affiliates (individually, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, "Indemnified
Parties") from, against and in respect of:

         (a) all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, punitive damages, causes
of action, lawsuits, administrative proceedings (including informal
proceedings), investigations, audits, demands, assessments, adjustments,
judgments, settlement payments, deficiencies, penalties, fines, interest
(including interest from the date of such damages) and costs and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements of
every kind, nature and description) (collectively, "Damages") suffered,
sustained, incurred or paid by the Indemnified Parties in connection with,
resulting from or arising out of, directly or indirectly:

             (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of SCC or the
         Shareholders set forth in this Agreement or any schedule or
         certificate, delivered by or on behalf of SCC or the Shareholders in
         connection herewith; or

             (ii) any nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement by the
         Shareholders, or, prior to the Effective Time, SCC, under this
         Agreement; or

             (iii) the business, operations or assets of SCC prior to the
         Closing Date or the actions or omissions of SCC's officers, employees
         or agents prior to the Closing Date; or



                                       36
<PAGE>   41
             (iv) the matters disclosed on the Disclosure Schedule or the
         nonfulfillment of any representation, covenant or agreement described
         in Section 3.5, Section 3.6, Section 3.10, Section 3.12 or Section
         3.13; or

             (v) the failure of SCC or any Shareholder to obtain any necessary
         consent relating to the leasing by SCC of the leasehold property
         utilized by SCC; or

             (vi) fraud; and

         (b) any and all Damages incident to any of the foregoing or to the
enforcement of this Section 12.1; and

         (c) all representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this
Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules, the supplements to the Disclosure
Schedules, the certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any other
certificate or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the
Closing. The right to indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedies
based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations will not be
affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to
indemnification, payment of Damages or other remedies based on such
representation, warranties, covenants and obligations.

         SECTION 12.2 LIMITATION AND EXPIRATION. Notwithstanding the above:

         (a) (i) there shall be no liability for indemnification under Section
12.1 unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds $100,000 (the "Franchise
Deductible"); provided, however, if Damages exceed the Franchise Deductible, the
Indemnifying Persons shall be liable for all such Damages and (ii) provided,
further that the Franchise Deductible shall not apply to Damages arising out of
any breaches of the covenants of the Shareholders set forth in this Agreement or
representations and warranties made in Section 3.1, Section 3.5, Section 3.6,
Section 3.10 or Section 3.12 or for fraud (the "Deductible Exclusions");

         (b) the aggregate amount of any Shareholders' liability under this
Article 12 except for matters referred to as Deductible Exclusions shall not
exceed an amount equal to the Merger Consideration valued at the Closing Date
Price, defined below and received by such Shareholder;

         (c) the indemnification obligations under this Article 12, or under any
certificate or writing furnished in connection herewith, shall terminate at the
date that is the later of clause (i) or (ii) of this Section 12.2(c):



                                       37
<PAGE>   42
                  (i) (1) with respect to claims relating to or arising out of
         (i) any Taxes arising out of or relating to the business of SCC; or
         (ii) any taxes arising out of the payment of salaries, wages, bonuses,
         commissions, distributions or the granting of options or stock to any
         shareholder during their entire term as an employee, whether a
         shareholder at the time of payment or not; (iii) any taxes arising out
         of the reorganization of the shareholdings or the reorganization of the
         structure of the entities prior to the Closing Date; or (iv) the
         irrevocable assignment of all commissions, fees or other amounts due to
         SCC; or (v) any damages or expenses arising from or related to the
         claims alleged by Dr. Arun Misra against Tolbert, SCC or any other
         employee or shareholder of SCC: (A) the date that is six (6) months
         after the expiration of the longest applicable federal or state statute
         of limitation (including extensions thereof), or (B) if there is no
         applicable statute of limitation, ten (10) years after the Closing
         Date; or

                       (2) with respect to claims other than those specified in
         clause (i)(1) of this Section 12.2(c) that are of a nature and of
         sufficient materiality typically expected to be encountered in the
         audit process, on the completion of the first independent audit of the
         financial statements of the combined operations of HCC and SCC; or

                       (3) with respect to all claims other than those referred
         to in clause (i)(1) or (2) of this Section 12.2(c), twelve (12) months
         after the Effective Time; or

                  (ii) the final resolution of claims or demands pending as of
         the relevant dates described in clause (i) of this Section 12.2(c)
         (such claims referred to as "Pending Claims") and Possible Claims. For
         purposes of this Agreement, a Possible Claim shall be one in which an
         Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying Party that a possible
         claim or demand may be made against the Indemnified Party for which
         indemnification under this Article 12, might be applicable, provided,
         however, that a Possible Claim, which has not become a Pending Claim,
         shall not extend the term of the Escrow Agreement beyond the Escrow
         Agreement's termination date by more than three (3) months.

         SECTION 12.3 AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article 12 and except as set forth in Section 12.2, each
Shareholder shall be liable severally and Pro Rata (as hereinafter defined)
(hereafter in this Section 12.3 referred to as "HCC Damages"). "Pro Rata" for
purposes of Section 12.1 and Section 12.2 with respect to each Shareholder shall
mean the proportion that such Shareholder's holdings of SCC Common Stock as of
the time immediately prior to the Effective Time bears to the total shares of
SCC Common Stock held by all Shareholders as of the time immediately prior to
the Effective Time. In seeking indemnification for HCC Damages under this
Article 12 following the Closing, the Indemnified Persons' remedy will be
limited to receiving up to that number of shares of HCC Common Stock determined
by dividing (a) the amount of the HCC Damages by (b) the closing sale price of
HCC's Common




                                       38
<PAGE>   43

Stock on the NYSE on the Effective Date (the "Closing Date Price"). Provided,
however, that irrespective as to the number of claims asserted by Indemnified
Persons hereunder and the amount of the HCC Damages for which indemnification is
sought, any such Shareholder, in the aggregate, shall under no circumstances be
required to make indemnification payments hereunder beyond the Closing Date
Price multiplied by the number of shares of HCC Common Stock received by such
Shareholder at the time of the Merger (the "Maximum Shareholder Liability").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event that at
the time of the resolution of any such indemnification claim, such Shareholder
does not hold the number of shares of HCC Common Stock (including any shares
otherwise acquired at any time before or after the Effective Time or at any time
after any claim is made for indemnification) necessary to settle any
indemnification claim, then such Shareholder shall pay in cash or other
immediately available funds the cash equivalent of the remainder of his in-stock
indemnification obligations under this Section 12.3 up to his Maximum
Shareholder Liability. In lieu of HCC Common Stock, any Shareholder shall have
the option to pay in cash or other immediately available funds the cash
equivalent of all or any part of his in-stock Maximum Shareholder Liability.

         SECTION 12.4 HCC AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article 12, HCC will indemnify and hold harmless SCC, and the SCC
Shareholders and their officers, shareholders, directors, administrators,
successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, demands, actions,
causes of action, losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses including,
without limitation, reasonable legal fees, (hereafter in this Section 12.4
referred to as "SCC Damages") arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of
or default under any of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements given or made by HCC or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any
certificate or exhibit delivered by or on behalf of HCC or Merger Sub pursuant
hereto. In seeking indemnification for SCC Damages under this Section 12.4
following the Closing, the Indemnified Party's remedy will be limited to
receiving that number of additional shares of HCC Common Stock determined by
dividing (a) the amount of the SCC Damages by (b) the Closing Date Price.
Provided, however, that irrespective of the number of claims asserted by
Indemnified Persons hereunder in the amount of the SCC Damages for which
indemnification is sought, HCC, in the aggregate, shall under no circumstances
be obligated to make an indemnification payment hereunder beyond that number of
additional shares of HCC Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of HCC
Common Stock provided to the SCC Shareholders on the Effective Date (the
"Maximum HCC Liability"). The indemnification provided for in this Section 12.4
will not apply unless and until the aggregate SCC Damages for which one or more
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate, in
which event the indemnification provided for will include all SCC Damages (a
Franchise Deductible) up to the Maximum HCC Liability. The Franchise Deductible
and Maximum HCC Liability shall not apply to damages arising from fraud.

         SECTION 12.5 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION; THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

         (a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party under this Article
12 of notice of a claim or if the Indemnified Party believes it is or could be
entitled to indemnification under this Article 12 (collectively a "Claim"), the
Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be made against an Indemnifying Party,
give prompt written notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Claim, but the
failure to promptly notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of any Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party,
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense
of such action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to give such
prompt notice. Such notice shall contain a description in reasonable detail of
facts upon which such Claim is based and, to the extent known, the amount
thereof. Such notice shall serve to preserve the Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnity against the Indemnifying Party without regard to the expiration of the
time periods set forth in Section 12.2 hereof.

         (b) If any Claim referred to in this Article 12 is made by a third
party against an Indemnified Party and such Indemnified Party gives written
notice to the Indemnifying Party of the Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled to participate in the defense of Claim but under all circumstances HCC
shall be entitled to assume the defense of the Claim and, thereafter, if HCC has
so assumed the defense, no other Party hereto will be liable under this Article
12 for any fees of counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense of
the Claim in each case subsequently incurred in connection with the defense of
the Claim unless such other Party elects to retain its separate counsel. If HCC
is not the Indemnifying Party and elects, in writing, not to assume the defense,
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense and HCC will not be liable for
any fees or expenses with respect to the defense of the Claim, unless HCC elects
to retain its separate counsel.

         SECTION 12.6 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. It is a fundamental point of
mutual agreement among all Parties hereto that the Parties' liability for and in
respect of this Agreement and the Merger shall, except for matters relating to
Deductible Exclusions, be limited to the absolute, fixed dollar amounts and for
the absolute, fixed time limitations specified in this Article 12. These
limitations of amount of liability and time to assert any such liability shall
apply to all claims and other demands, charges, allegations, liabilities,
responsibilities, exposures and the like.

                                   ARTICLE 13
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 13.1 APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE. Subject to the
successorship provisions of this Section 13.1, Schanen (the "Representative") is
hereby irrevocably appointed as the attorney-in-fact and representative of the
interests of the Shareholders for all purposes of this Agreement, and notice is
hereby given thereof to HCC and Merger Sub, and, without independent
verification, HCC and Merger Sub may rely upon Representative's undertakings in
such capacity. The Representative shall have full and irrevocable authority on
behalf of the Shareholders, and shall promptly and completely exercise such
authority in a timely fashion to:

         (a) participate in, represent and bind the Shareholders in all respects
with respect to any arbitration or legal proceeding relating to this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the defense and settlement of any matter, and the
calculation thereof for every purpose thereunder, consent to jurisdiction, enter
into any settlement, and consent to entry of judgment, each with respect to any
or all of the Shareholders;

         (b) receive, accept and give notices and other communications relating
to this Agreement;

         (c) take any action that the Representative deems necessary or
desirable in order to fully effectuate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;

         (d) execute and deliver any instrument or document that the
Representative deems necessary or desirable in the exercise of his authority
under this Section 13.1; and

         (e) waive the fulfillment of any condition or conditions to the
Closing.

         Those Shareholders who, as of the Effective Date, hold a majority of
the SCC Common Stock may, at any time and by written action delivered to HCC,
remove the Representative or any successor thereto, but such removal shall be
effective only upon the replacement of such Representative or successor by a new
Representative designated, by written notice delivered to HCC, by those
Shareholders who, as of the date hereof hold a majority of SCC Common Stock,
provided, however, that any such notice shall be effective upon actual receipt
by HCC. Any such written notice shall be delivered to HCC in accordance with the
notice provisions set forth in Section 13.4 hereof. If any Representative shall
have died, become Disabled or unable to serve, those Shareholders who, as of the
date hereof, hold a majority of SCC Common Stock shall promptly designate by
written notice delivered to HCC, a replacement Representative. Any costs and
expenses incurred by the Representative in connection with actions taken
pursuant to or permitted by this Section 13.1 will be borne by the Shareholders
and paid or reimbursed to the Representative Pro Rata.

         The foregoing authorization is granted and conferred in consideration
for the various agreements and covenants of HCC and Merger Sub contained herein.
In



                                       41
<PAGE>   46

consideration of the foregoing, and subject to the successorship provisions of
this Section 13.1, this authorization granted to the Representative shall be
irrevocable and shall not be terminated by any act of any of the Shareholders or
by operation of law, whether by death or incompetence of any Shareholder or by
the occurrence of any other event except the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1 hereof. If after the execution hereof any such
Shareholder shall die or become incompetent, the Representative is nevertheless
authorized and directed to exercise the authority granted in this Section 13.1
as if such death or incompetence had not occurred and regardless of notice
thereof. The Representative shall have no liability to any Shareholder for any
act or omission or obligation hereunder, provided that such action or omission
is taken by the Representative in good faith and without willful misconduct.

         SECTION 13.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party agrees to cooperate fully
with the other parties and to execute such further instruments, documents and
agreements and to give such further written assurances as may be reasonably
requested by any other party to better evidence and reflect the transactions
described herein and contemplated hereby and to carry into effect the intents
and purposes of this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Until otherwise agreed by the parties,
each party shall bear its own fees and expenses, including counsel fees and fees
of brokers and investment bankers contracted by such party, in connection with
the transaction contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 13.4 NOTICES. Whenever any party hereto desires or is required
to give any notice, demand, or request with respect to this Agreement, each such
communication shall be in writing and shall be effective only if it is delivered

         SECTION 13.5 GOVERNING LAW. The internal laws of the State of Texas
(irrespective of its choice of law principles) will govern the validity of this
Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement
of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. Any dispute arising hereunder
shall lie exclusively in the state courts of the State of Texas, or in the
Federal courts sitting in Harris County, Texas.

         SECTION 13.6 BINDING UPON SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, ASSIGNMENT. This
Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding upon each of the parties,
their permitted successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by
any party without the prior consent of the others, provided, however, that HCC

another wholly-owned Subsidiary of HCC (without in any way relieving HCC of its
obligations under this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub or the Merger).

         SECTION 13.7 SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, shall for any reason or to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances shall continue in full force and effect and in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

         SECTION 13.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the Operative
Agreements and instruments referenced herein constitute the entire understanding

<PAGE>   48

agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede
all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings, inducements or
conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between parties with respect
hereto.

         SECTION 13.9 AMENDMENT AND WAIVERS. Any amendment or waiver affecting
the Shareholders shall be valid if consented to in writing by the Representative
or Shareholders holding a majority of the shares of SCC Common Stock (i) if
given or made prior to the Effective Time, such majority as determined as of the
date of such amendment or waiver, and (ii) if given or made at or after the
Effective Time, such majority as determined immediately prior to the Effective
Time. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended, and the observance
of any term of this Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular
instance and either retroactively or prospectively) only by a writing signed by
those persons as provided in this Section 13.9. The waiver by a party of any
breach hereof or default in the performance hereof shall not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default,
unless such waiver so expressly states. At any time before the Effective Time,
this Agreement may be amended or supplemented by SCC, the Shareholders or HCC
with respect to any of the terms contained in this Agreement.

         SECTION 13.10 NO WAIVER. The failure of any party to enforce any of the
provisions hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such
party thereafter to enforce such provisions.

         SECTION 13.11 CONSTRUCTION OF AGREEMENT. A reference to an Article,
Section or an Exhibit shall mean an Article of, a Section in, or Exhibit to,
this Agreement unless otherwise explicitly set forth. The titles and headings
herein are for reference purposes only and shall not in any manner limit the

"include," and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be
followed by the words "without limitation." No Party shall be deemed to have
prepared this Agreement for purpose of aiding in the construction thereof.

         SECTION 13.12 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original as against any Party
whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         The undersigned proposes to sell an aggregate of ______ shares of the
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, (the "Stock") of HCC Insurance
Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") through ___________(the "Broker") in accordance
with the requirements of Rule 144, as amended ("Rule 144") promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"). The undersigned hereby requests
that the restrictive legends now appearing upon certificates representing the
Stock owned beneficially and of record by the undersigned be removed and that
the stop transfer instructions to the Company's transfer agent (the "Transfer
Agent") with respect to the Stock be rescinded, in accordance with and pursuant
to Rule 144. It is understood, however that legends will only be removed and
instructions rescinded in order to effect the transfer of Stock already sold in
compliance with Rules 144 (the "Sale Shares") and after confirmation of this
fact is received from the Broker who has executed my order to sell the Stock.

         In addition, if required by such Transfer Agent, the undersigned
requests that your attorneys provide to the Transfer Agent a written opinion of
counsel (the "Opinion"), confirming that the Sale Shares may be transferred
without restriction to the purchaser(s) thereof in reliance upon Rule 144 and
that any stop transfer instructions with respect to the Sale Shares may be
removed.

         In support of this request and in consideration for the removal of such
legends and rescission of such instructions to effect transfers after sales have
been made in compliance with Rule 144, and in order to permit your attorneys to
render the Opinion, the undersigned hereby represents, warrants and agrees with
the Company and your attorneys who furnish the Opinion as follows:

1.       Attached hereto is a fully completed and manually signed copy of a
         Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities Pursuant to Rule 144 ("Form 144")
         with respect to the sale of the Stock. As set forth on Form 144, the
         undersigned has been the beneficial owner of the Stock for a period of
         at least one (1) year prior to the date hereof as computed in
         accordance with paragraph (d) of Rule

         for the undersigned's account and by or for the account of any person
         whose sales are required by paragraph (a)(2) and paragraph (e)(3) of
         Rule 144, to be aggregated with sales by or for it (other than shares
         registered under the Act or sold in private placement or Regulation A
         transactions) will not exceed the amounts permitted under Rule 144(e).

         of, and will not solicit or arrange for the solicitation of, orders to
         buy the Stock in anticipation of or in connection with such proposed
         sale; and such sale or sales shall be made in transactions contemplated
         by paragraph (f) under Rule 144. The undersigned has no sell orders
         open in the Stock, or in any security convertible into the Stock with
         any other broker or bank and will not place any such sell orders
         pending the completion of this transaction. The undersigned has no
         present intention of selling any additional securities of the same
         class as the Stock or any securities convertible into the same class as
         the Stock. The undersigned has not made, and will not make, any payment
         in connection with the offering or sale of the Stock to any person,
         other than the usual and customary broker's commission paid to the
         Broker in connection therewith.
