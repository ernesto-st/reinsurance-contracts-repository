respective Commitments of the applicable Class; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure

Lender). Except for Loans deemed made pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.02(f) and subject to Section&nbsp;2.22
relating to Swingline Loans, the Loans comprising any Borrowing shall be in an aggregate principal
amount that is (i)&nbsp;an integral multiple of $500,000 and not less than $1,000,000 or (ii)&nbsp;equal to

Borrowings may be converted into or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing having an Interest Period
in excess of one month prior to the date which is 60&nbsp;days after the Closing Date. Each Lender may
at its option make any Eurodollar Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of
such Lender to make such Loan; <U>provided</U> that any exercise of such option shall not affect
the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any Borrowing that, if made,
would result in more than ten Eurodollar Borrowings outstanding hereunder at any time. For
purposes of the foregoing, Borrowings having different Interest Periods, regardless of whether they
commence on the same date, shall be considered separate Borrowings.

proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account in New York
City as the Administrative Agent may designate not later than 1:30 p.m., New York City time, and
the Administrative Agent shall promptly credit the amounts so received to an account in the name of

that the Collateral Agent may curtail or terminate said authority at any time after the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default. If required by the Collateral Agent at any time
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any payments of
Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i)&nbsp;shall be forthwith (and, in any event, within two
Business Days) deposited by such Grantor in the exact form received, duly endorsed by such Grantor
to the Collateral Agent if required, in a Collateral Account maintained under the sole dominion and
control of the Collateral Agent, subject to withdrawal by the Collateral Agent for the account of
the Secured Parties only as provided in Section&nbsp;6.5, and (ii)&nbsp;until so turned over, shall be held

enacted. Each Grantor agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at least
ten days notice to such Grantor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which
any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable notification. The Collateral Agent

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Late Charges</B>: If I fail to pay any installment within ten days of its due date, I agree to pay
you a late charge of 5% of the delinquent amount or $5.00 whichever is greater. A late charge will
also be assessed if the policy is canceled due to insufficient funds.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Default and Acceleration</B>: If I fail to pay one installment and it remains unpaid for ten days
or more after the due date, this Promissory Note will be in default and you may cancel my Insurance
Policy. If two or more installments are in default for ten days or more, you may accelerate the
maturity of this Promissory note, which means that I must pay all outstanding amounts immediately.
After making any rebate required by law, you may then convert this Promissory Note into a simple
interest transaction.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Additional Interest</B>: If you accelerate the maturity of this Promissory Note or if it remains
unpaid after the final installment is due, then, for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year after maturity, I
agree to pay additional Interest on the unpaid balance (after any applicable rebate) at the
interest rate shown above. After that, I agree to pay interest at the rate of 18% per annum, until
this Promissory Note is paid in full.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Rebate</B>: I may prepay this Promissory Note in full at any time. If I prepay in full, or if you
accelerate the maturity of this Promissory Note, l may be entitled to a refund of part of the
finance charge as determined by the simple Interest method. The $25.00 Origination Fee I paid when
I first made my loan is earned when my loan is closed and will not be rebated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Attorney&#146;s Fees</B>: If you refer this Promissory Note to any attorney for collection, I agree to
pay attorney&#146;s fees in an amount equal to 25% of the unpaid debt owed to you.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Unpaid Check Charges</B>: If I pay by check and my check is returned because I stopped payment, or
because there were insufficient funds in my account, I will pay you an additional amount, equal to
5% of the amount of my dishonored check, or $15.00, whichever is less.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Non-negotiable</B>: This Promissory Note is not negotiable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Waivers</B>: I waive demand for payment, notice of protest and of non-payment, and all defenses of
division and discussion. My liability under this Promissory Note is &#147;in solido&#148; with the liability
of any other person who may be liable. Discharge or release of any specific right, or of any
security given to secure payment, will not affect the remainder of my obligation.

insurance Policy. You may apply any money you receive from my Insurance policy to pay any debt owed
to you under this Contract, including any amount due under the Promissory Note, the $25.00
Cancellation Fee described below, attorney fees, or any deferred charges. Even though you have the
right to be paid from proceeds of the Insurance Policy, I remain personally liable to pay you these
amounts until everything is paid.

any amendments to this Contract, including amendments you make pursuant to this Power of Attorney.
I give a power of attorney to notify my Insurance Company and any persons entitled to notice and to
tell them that my Insurance Policy is cancelled. After payment of all amounts due to you under this
Contract, I also give you power of attorney to pay to the Insurance Company (or allow the Insurance
Company to retain) any unearned premiums or other amounts which the Insurance Company may otherwise
owe me, in order to purchase as much continued coverage under the Insurance Policy as such funds
permit, until such time as I prove to the Insurance Company that I have purchased replacement
insurance, as required by law or as required by any other person entitled to the benefit of
coverage. I may not revoke this power of attorney while my Promissory Note remains unpaid and until
I have provided such replacement Insurance.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to secure payment of any amounts that I may owe you under this Contract, I give you a
security interest in my Insurance Policy, including (but not limited to) any right to a refund of
premiums or any amount the Insurance Company might otherwise owe me for losses covered by my
insurance Policy. You may apply any money you receive from my Insurance policy to pay any debt owed
to you under this Contract, including any amount due under the Promissory Note, the $25.00
Cancellation Fee described below, attorney fees, or any deferred charges. Even though you have the
right to be paid from proceeds of the Insurance Policy, I remain personally liable to pay you these
amounts until everything is paid.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you a power of attorney. If I fail to pay even one installment on the Promissory Note,
I authorize you to cancel my Insurance Policy and any endorsements listed on this Contract or in
any amendments to this Contract, including amendments you make pursuant to this Power of Attorney.
I give a power of attorney to notify my Insurance Company and any persons entitled to notice and to
tell them that my Insurance Policy is cancelled. After payment of all amounts due to you under this
Contract, I also give you power of attorney to pay to the Insurance Company (or allow the Insurance
Company to retain) any unearned premiums or other amounts which the Insurance Company may otherwise
owe me, in order to purchase as much continued coverage under the Insurance Policy as such funds
permit, until such time as I prove to the Insurance Company that I have purchased replacement
insurance, as required by law or as required by any other person entitled to the benefit of
coverage. I may not revoke this power of attorney while my Promissory Note remains unpaid and until
I have provided such replacement Insurance.
