In this Agreement, where it relates to a Swiss entity, such as a Swiss Borrower, a reference to a winding-up or dissolution includes: (a) a filing for the declaration of bankruptcy (Antrag auf Konkurser&ouml;ffnung) or a formal declaration of bankruptcy (Konkurser&ouml;ffnung) within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act; (b) the filing for a request for a moratorium (Gesuch um Nachlasstundung) or a grant of a moratorium (Nachlassstundung) within the meaning of the Swiss Federal Debt Enforcement and Bankruptcy Act; (c) a moratorium on any of its indebtedness, its dissolution or liquidation; and (d) a postponement of a bankruptcy (Konkursaufschub) within the meaning of Art. 725a of the Swiss Code of Obligations. 1.6. Interest Rates; LIBORBenchmark Notification.  The interest rate on a Loan denominated in dDollars or a Foreign Currency may be derived from an interest rate benchmark that may be discontinued or is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform.  Regulators have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which they are calculated may change.  The London interbank offered rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market.  On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) publicly announced that: (a) immediately after December 31, 2021, publication of all seven euro LIBOR settings, all seven Swiss Franc LIBOR settings, the spot next, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month Japanese Yen LIBOR settings, the overnight, 1-week, 2-month and 12-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings, and the 1-week and 2-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after June 30, 2023, publication of the overnight and 12-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will permanently cease; immediately after December 31, 2021, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month Japanese Yen LIBOR settings and the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month British Pound Sterling LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to consultation by the FCA, be provided on a changed methodology (or &#8220;synthetic&#8221;) basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored; and immediately after June 30, 2023, the 1-month, 3-month and 6-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or, subject to the FCA&#8217;s consideration of the case, be provided on a synthetic basis and no longer be representative of the underlying market and economic reality they are intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored.  There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published.  Each party to this agreement should consult its own advisors to stay informed of any such developments.  Public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of LIBOR.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event, an Early Opt-in  Election or an Other Benchmark Rate Election,  Sections 2.18(b) and (c) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower,  pursuant to  Section 2.18(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Term Benchmark Loans is based.  However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission, performance or any other matter related to the Daily Simple RFR, LIBOR or other rates in the definition of &#8220;LIBO Rate&#8221; (or &#8220;EURIBOR Rate&#8221;, or &#8220;TIBOR Rate&#8221;, as applicable) orany interest rate used in this 69 4877-1242-0416 </FONT></DIV>

(b) No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any applicable Requirement of Law or any pre-existing generally applicable internal policies of such Issuing Lender applicable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender.

Procedure for Issuance of Letter of Credit. Any Borrower may from time to time request that any Issuing Lender issue a Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may request.

Such fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date. In addition, each applicable Borrower shall pay to the relevant Issuing Lender for its own account a fronting fee equal to 0.125% per annum (or such lesser amount separately agreed in writing between the relevant Issuing Lender and the Company) of the undrawn and unexpired amount of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender for the account of such Borrower (or for the joint and several account of such Borrower and any Subsidiary), payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.

If any such amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.4(a) is not made available to the relevant Issuing Lender by such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant, on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at the rate per annum applicable to ABR Loans under the Revolving Facility. A certificate of the relevant Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive absent manifest error. (c) Whenever, at any time after any Issuing Lender has made payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.4(a), such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such Letter of Credit (whether directly from the applicable Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment of interest on account thereof, such Issuing Lender will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by such Issuing Lender shall be required to be returned by such Issuing Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by such Issuing Lender to it. 3.5. Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrowers. Each applicable Borrower agrees to reimburse the relevant Issuing Lender in U.S. Dollars (in the case of any Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency, in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such draft) no later than the first Business Day following each date on which such Issuing Lender notifies such Borrower of the date and amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrower (or for the 110 4877-1242-0416 </FONT></DIV>

Each Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender that such Issuing Lender shall not be responsible for, and such Borrower&#8217;s Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.5 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid, fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among any Borrower and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of any Borrower against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee.

In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged or received by Administrative Agent or any Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate and spread, in equal or unequal parts, the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of this Agreement. 10.20. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: (a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and (b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: (i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; (ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its Company entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or (iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any the applicable Resolution Authority. 10.21. Conversion of Currencies. (a) If, for the purpose of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one currency into another currency, each party hereto (including, upon any Subsidiary becoming a Subsidiary Borrower, such Subsidiary Borrower) agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction, the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given. (b) The obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Borrowers in respect of any sum due to any party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the &#8220;Applicable Creditor&#8221;) shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the &#8220;Judgment Currency&#8221;) other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due hereunder (the &#8220;Agreement Currency&#8221;), be discharged only to the 175 4877-1242-0416 </FONT></DIV>

The obligations of the Company and the Subsidiary Borrowers contained in this Section 10.21 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other amounts owing hereunder. 10.22.

Notwithstanding the above, the Domestic Loan Parties shall guarantee the payment and performance of the Foreign Obligations, and the Collateral of the Domestic Loan Parties shall secure such guarantees, in each case as set forth in and in accordance with the applicable Security Documents. 10.23. Several Obligations. The respective obligations of the Lenders under this Agreement are several and not joint and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to satisfy its obligations hereunder. 10.24. MIRE Events. In connection with any amendment to this Agreement pursuant to which any increase, extension or renewal of Loans is contemplated, the Borrowers shall cause to be delivered to the Administrative Agent for any Mortgaged Property, a completed &#8220;life of the loan&#8221; Federal Emergency Management Agency Standard Flood Hazard Determination and for any Mortgaged Property with a building in a special flood hazard area, an acknowledgment by the applicable Loan Party, and evidence of flood insurance, as may be required pursuant to the Flood Laws. 10.25.

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
