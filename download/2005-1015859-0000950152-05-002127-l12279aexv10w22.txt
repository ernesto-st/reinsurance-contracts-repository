<PAGE>
     AND ALL CLAIMS PURCHASER MIGHT HAVE REGARDING ANY FORM OF WARRANTY, EXPRESS
     OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND OR TYPE, RELATING TO THE PROPERTY AND THE
     INFORMATION. SUCH WAIVER AND RELEASE IS ABSOLUTE, UNCONDITIONAL,
     IRREVOCABLE, COMPLETE, TOTAL AND UNLIMITED IN ANY WAY. SUCH WAIVER AND
     RELEASE INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, A WAIVER AND RELEASE OF EXPRESS
     WARRANTIES, IMPLIED WARRANTIES, WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE,
     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, WARRANTIES OF HABITABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY
     RIGHTS AND CLAIMS OF EVERY KIND AND TYPE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED, TO

     RELATING TO OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, ALL OTHER EXTANT
     OR LATER CREATED OR CONCEIVED OF STRICT LIABILITY OR STRICT LIABILITY TYPE
     CLAIMS AND RIGHTS, SUBJECT TO THE EXPRESS PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT

     2.03 LIMITS OF ASSUMPTIONS AND ASSIGNMENTS.

          (a) ASSUMPTION OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES. Purchaser shall assume and be
     responsible for the timely satisfaction or performance, as the case may be,
     of all liabilities or obligations arising under or in connection with the
     Property and the business related to the Property to the extent such
     liabilities or obligations arise or are incurred and are first required to
     be performed after the Closing Date (collectively, the "ASSUMED
     LIABILITIES").

          (b) LIABILITIES NOT ASSUMED. With the exception of the Assumed
     Liabilities and as stated otherwise herein, Purchaser shall not by
     execution and performance of this Agreement or otherwise, assume or
     otherwise be responsible for any liability or obligation of any nature of
     Seller or claims of such liability or obligation, whether arising out of
     occurrences prior to, at, or after the date hereof (collectively, the
     "RETAINED LIABILITIES").

          (c) ASSIGNMENT OF HOTEL CONTRACTS. Not later than ten (10) days prior
     to the end of the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall notify Seller of any
     Hotel Contract that Purchaser does not elect to assume. Any such Hotel
     Contract not assumed by Purchaser shall be deemed a part of the Retained
     Liabilities; provided, however, that in the event Purchaser elects not to
     assume all of the Hotel Contracts, then Seller may terminate this Agreement
     without liability by providing Purchaser with written notice of termination
     within ten (10) days of receipt of Purchaser's election not to assume all
     of the Hotel Contracts.

          (d) NON-ASSIGNMENT OF CERTAIN PROPERTY. To the extent that the
     assignment hereunder of any of the Hotel Contracts, any of the Space Leases
     or the Restaurant Lease shall require the consent of the other party (or in
     the event that any of the same shall be non-assignable), neither this
     Agreement nor any action taken pursuant to its provisions shall constitute
     an assignment or an agreement to assign if such


                                      U-11
<PAGE>
     assignment or attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or
     result in the loss or diminution in value thereof. Seller and Purchaser
     agree to each use reasonable efforts to obtain any assignments where
     necessary; provided, however, the failure to obtain any such assignments
     shall not effect Purchaser's assumption of the liabilities under such Hotel
     Contracts, Space Leases or Restaurant Lease in accordance with Section
     2.03(a) hereof.

                                  ARTICLE III

                           PURCHASE PRICE AND DEPOSIT

     3.01 PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price (the "PURCHASE PRICE") for the
Property to be paid by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing shall be NINETY-TWO
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND 00/100 Dollars ($92,500,000.00). The Purchase
Price shall be payable by Purchaser as follows:

          (a) Purchaser has previously deposited in an interest bearing account,
     with the Escrow Company, as escrow agent, the amount of One Million and
     00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) by a certified check or wire transfer of
     immediately available funds as a deposit (the "INITIAL DEPOSIT"). Purchaser
     shall have the right to cancel this Agreement and the Escrow for any reason
     or no reason prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period. Subject to
     the provisions of Section 3.01(d) and 3.01(e), if Purchaser terminates this
     Agreement prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period the Initial
     Deposit shall be fully refundable to Purchaser without off-set.

          (b) Unless Purchaser has terminated this Agreement as provided in
     Section 4.04, on or before the expiration of the Inspection Period,
     Purchaser shall deposit with the Escrow Company, as escrow company, the
     additional amount of One Million and 00/100 Dollars ($1,000,000.00) by a
     certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds as an
     additional deposit (together with interest earned thereon, the "ADDITIONAL
     DEPOSIT", and together with the Initial Deposit, and interest earned on the
     Initial Deposit or Additional Deposit, the "DEPOSIT").

          (c) On the date of Closing, Purchaser shall pay the balance of the
     Purchase Price, less the amount of the Deposit and subject to the
     prorations and adjustments provided for in this Agreement, including,
     without limitation, a possible reduction pursuant to Section 6.08(b), in
     cash by certified check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to
     the Escrow Company, as escrow company, in accordance with the terms and
     conditions of this Agreement. Purchaser shall be responsible for any income
     taxes payable with respect to any interest and/or dividends earned with
     respect to the Deposit and shall deliver a form W-9 to Escrow Company in
     connection therewith.

          (d) If Purchaser or its agents issue a press release or hold a press
     conference about the proposed transaction or otherwise disclose non-public
     information traceable to Purchaser without the prior written consent of
     Seller after September 9, 2004, the Deposit shall become non-refundable and
     shall immediately be released to Seller (but shall be applied against the
     Purchase Price in the event Purchaser performs its obligations under


                                      U-12
<PAGE>
     the Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have the
     right to commence efforts to market sales of to be formed condominium units
     comprising part of the Hotel on the later of (a) the expiration of the
     Inspection Period and (b) November 25, 2004, provided that in no event
     shall Purchaser (i) disclose the terms or timing of the transaction
     contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) represent that they own the Hotel;
     (iii) commence the process of creating a condominium; or (iv) purport to
     bind the Seller or otherwise enter into any binding contract with respect
     to the sale of such units prior to the Closing.

          (e) Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that a portion of the
     Initial Deposit equal to $250,000 is not refundable to the Purchaser if the
     Purchaser terminates this Agreement prior to the expiration of the
     Inspection Period. Purchaser acknowledges that if Purchaser terminates this
     Agreement prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period, Purchaser shall
     be entitled to $750,000 plus interest accrued on such $750,000 and Seller
     shall be entitled to $250,000 plus interest accrued on the $250,000.

     3.02 ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Seller and Purchaser hereby agree that
the Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Land, the Improvements and
Personal Property as set forth in Exhibit C for federal, state and local tax
purposes. The parties shall file all federal, state and local tax returns and
related documents consistent with the allocations set forth in Exhibit C.

     3.03 DEPOSIT ESCROW. The Deposit shall be held and disbursed by the Escrow
Company acting as escrow company. The Deposit shall be invested in a federally
issued or insured interest bearing instrument and shall be paid to the party to
which the Deposit is paid pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. If the
sale of the Property is consummated in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the Deposit shall be applied to the Purchase Price to be paid by
Purchaser at the Closing. In the event of a default under this Agreement by
Purchaser or Seller, the Deposit shall be applied as provided in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

Diligence provided that in


                                      U-13
<PAGE>
each such instance (i) Purchaser notifies Seller of its intent to enter the
Property to conduct its Diligence not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to
such entry and (ii) the date and approximate time period are scheduled with
Seller or the Manager. At Seller's election, a representative of Seller shall be

for Diligence. Purchaser shall take all necessary actions to ensure that neither
it nor any of its representatives unreasonably interfere with the Space Lessees
or guests of the Hotel or ongoing operations occurring at the Property.
Purchaser shall not cause or permit any mechanic liens, materialmen's liens, or
other liens to be filed against the Property as a result of its Diligence.

     4.03 TESTING. Purchaser shall have the right to conduct, at its sole cost
and expense, any inspections, studies or tests that Purchaser deems appropriate

not permitted to perform any sampling, boring, drilling or other physically
intrusive testing into the structures or ground comprising the Property,
including, without limitation, a so-called "PHASE II" environmental assessment,
without (i) submitting to Seller the scope and inspections for such testing; and
(ii) obtaining the prior written consent of Seller for such testing.

     4.04 ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION. Purchaser shall have until the expiration of
the Inspection Period to conduct its Diligence to determine whether the Property
is acceptable to Purchaser. Purchaser may, for any or no reason in its sole and
absolute discretion, terminate this Agreement by giving written notice of
termination (the "TERMINATION NOTICE") to Seller and the Escrow Company on or
before the expiration of the Inspection Period. Upon receipt by Seller and the
Escrow Company of the Termination Notice on or prior to the expiration of the
Inspection Period, (i) this Agreement shall automatically terminate, and the
parties shall have no further obligations to or recourse against each other
(except for any provisions of this Agreement which are expressly stated to
survive the termination of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 4.07) and (ii) subject to
provisions of Sections 3.01(d) and 3.01(e), the Escrow Company shall promptly
return to Purchaser the Deposit. If Purchaser does not timely give a Termination
Notice on or before the expiration of the Inspection Period: (i) Purchaser shall
be deemed to have fully and knowingly waived its right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.04 and (ii) the Deposit shall become
non-refundable, subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

Seller (i) not to disclose to any third party (other than its investors,
lenders, accountants, attorneys, and other professionals and consultants in
connection with the transaction contemplated in this Agreement) without Seller's
prior written consent, unless Purchaser is obligated by law to make such
disclosure, any of the reports or any other documentation or information
obtained by Purchaser which relates to the Property or Seller in any way, all of
which shall be used by Purchaser and its agents solely in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) not to issue a press release
or hold a press conference about the proposed transaction or otherwise disclose
non-public information about the Property or the transaction contemplated
hereunder without the prior written consent of Seller. If this Agreement is
terminated, Purchaser agrees that all such information will continue to be held
in strict confidence and, to the extent possible, all such information that was
provided by Seller to Purchaser shall be returned or delivered to Seller or

Title Commitment that are objectionable to Purchaser (together herein called
"TITLE DEFECTS" ). All exceptions shown on the Title Commitment not objected to
by Purchaser in its notice to Seller shall be deemed acceptable to Purchaser.
Seller shall have a period of seven (7) days following Seller's receipt of
Purchaser's objection to any Title Defects in which to notify Purchaser which of
such Title Defects Seller will cure or have removed. If Seller will not cure or
remove all such Title Defects, Purchaser shall elect either to (i) waive its
objection to those Title Defects that Seller will not cure or remove, in which
case this Agreement will continue, and Seller shall have until expiration of the
Inspection Period to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cure or remove
those Title Defects identified in its notice to Purchaser as Title Defects that
Seller will cure or remove; or (ii) terminate this Agreement, in which case, the
Escrow Company shall thereupon return to Purchaser the funds and documents
previously paid or deposited by it, including, but not limited to, the Deposit,
and the parties shall be fully released and discharged from any obligation
hereunder. Purchaser shall notify Seller of its election in writing within three
(3) days after receipt of Seller's notice, and Purchaser's failure to provide
such timely notice in response to Seller's notice shall constitute Purchaser's
election to waive its objection to the Title Defects that Seller will not cure
or remove and proceed as provided in (i) above. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 4.06, prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
remove and discharge from record any and all deeds of trust, mortgages,
mechanic's liens for work performed on or material delivered to the Property,
delinquent taxes and delinquent assessments (collectively, the "MONETARY
EXCEPTIONS") encumbering title to the Real Property regardless of whether
Purchaser has objected thereto or not. Seller acknowledges and agrees that in
the event that Seller fails or refuses to remove and discharge any Monetary
Exception from title on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser may instruct the
Escrow Company to use and apply Purchase Price at the Closing Date to remove
such Monetary Exceptions.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any new lien,
covenant, condition, restriction, reservation, easement, right of way or other
encumbrance affecting the Real Property (each, a "NEW EXCEPTION") becomes of
record after the date of the Title Commitment (other than an exception caused by
Purchaser or consented to in writing by Purchaser), then (i) if the New
Exception was caused or consented to by Seller or any of its affiliates, then
Seller shall cause such New Exception to be removed prior to the Closing Date;
or (ii) if the New Exception was not caused or consented to by Seller or any of
its affiliates, then Seller may, but shall not be obligated to, remove such new
title exception within five (5) days after receipt of notice of such New
Exception.


                                      U-15
<PAGE>
     If Seller elects or is obligated to remove a New Exception, then, if
necessary, the Seller may extend the Closing Date by up to five (5) Business
Days to permit or arrange for any such removal. In the event that, pursuant to
clause (ii) in the previous paragraph, Seller elects not to remove such New
Exception within such period, then Purchaser shall have the right, by written
notice to Seller and the Escrow Company given within five (5) Business Days
after receipt of written notice from Seller that Seller has elected not to
remove such New Exception, to (A) accept such New Exception or (B) terminate
this Agreement, in which case Purchaser shall be refunded the Deposit, this
Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force or effect and the
parties shall thereafter have no further rights or obligations hereunder. If
such New Exception was caused by or consented to in writing by Purchaser, then
Purchaser shall take title to the Property subject to such New Exception.

     4.07 RELEASE AND INDEMNIFICATION Except with respect to any loss, cost,
damage or claim arising from the Purchaser's discovery of the existence of any
adverse conditions of any nature existing at the Real Property, the Purchaser
shall indemnify and defend the Seller against any loss, damage or claim arising
from the Diligence activities of the Purchaser or any agents, contractors or
employees of the Purchaser or from the entry upon the Real Property by the
Purchaser or any agents, contractors or employees of the Purchaser (including
any loss, damage or claim arising from the exercise of inspection rights by
Purchaser hereunder). The Purchaser, at its own expense, shall restore any
damage to the Real Property caused by any of the tests or studies made by the
Purchaser. Purchaser shall return the Property to the same condition as prior to
any tests or studies. This indemnification shall survive any termination of this
Agreement or any closing of the transaction contemplated herein.

                                   ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     5.01 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER. Seller hereby represents and
warrants the following matters to Purchaser. Whenever a representation or
warranty or other reference is made in this Agreement on the basis of the actual
knowledge of Seller or words of similar import, such representation, warranty or
reference is made solely on the basis of the actual, as distinguished from
implied, imputed and constructive, knowledge on the date that such
representation or warranty is made, of Richard Conti, President and Chief
Operating Officer of Boykin Lodging Company, or James Luchars, Vice President of
AEW Capital Management, L.P., without inquiry or investigation or duty.

          (a) DUE ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORIZATION. Seller is a limited liability
     company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
     of Delaware and qualified to do business in Illinois. Seller has full power
     and authority, and has taken all corporate and other action necessary to
     authorize Seller to make, execute, deliver, and perform this Agreement. The
     person executing this Agreement on behalf of Seller has been duly
     authorized to do so. Except as provided in Article 8, this Agreement is a
     binding and legal agreement of Seller, enforceable against Seller in
     accordance with its terms, except as such may be subject to or limited by
     the effect of any bankruptcy, reorganization, moratorium, insolvency, or
     other laws affecting the rights of creditors generally


                                      U-16

          (b) NO CONFLICT. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
     closing documents to be executed in connection herewith and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except as
     otherwise provided herein, do not require the consent or approval of any
     governmental authority, nor shall such execution and delivery result in a
     breach or violation of any Legal Requirement or Permit, or conflict with,
     breach, result in a default (or an event which with notice and passage of
     time or both will constitute a default) under, or violate any contract or

     bound or any Permit.

     described in Exhibit E, there are no actions, suits, or proceedings,
     pending or threatened against Seller related to the Property or the Hotel
     or otherwise affecting the Property or any of Seller's rights therein or
     Seller's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement and which,
     if decided adversely against Seller, would have a materially adverse effect
     on the Hotel or the Property. To Seller's actual knowledge, except as noted
     in Exhibit F, there is no violation of any Legal Requirement with regard to
     the Property and Seller has not received any notice of any violation of a

     effect on the Hotel or the Property.

          grievances, complaints or charges with respect to employment or labor
          matters pending in any judicial, regulatory or administrative forum,

          nor any Affiliate of Manager has received any notice threatening any
          of the foregoing); (d) there are no audits or investigations of any of
          Manager's or any Affiliate of Manager's employment practices or
          policies by any governmental entity pending or threatened, and (e)

               (ii) Neither Seller, Manager nor any Affiliate of Manager have
          made any representation, express or implied, concerning the terms or
          conditions on which Purchaser or its Manager may offer to employ any
          Employees.

               (iii) Except as set forth in Exhibit G, there are no pending or
          threatened demands for settlement or other resolution of employment or
          labor claims or disputes.

          (f) TITLE TO PERSONAL PROPERTY; EQUIPMENT LEASES. Except as set forth
     in Exhibit I, Seller has good and valid title to all of the tangible

     list of equipment and other Personal Property leased by Seller pursuant to

     Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00) for any year during the term of
     such lease after the Closing.

          (g) TAXES. Except as listed on Exhibit J Seller has not received any
     written notice of any audit of any taxes payable with respect to the

          given nor received any written notice of any breach or default under
          any of the Space Leases which has not been cured and, to the Seller's
          actual knowledge, no event has occurred or circumstance exists which,
          with notice or the passage of time, would result in a breach or
          default by the Seller or the Space Lessee thereunder. Seller has fully
          reconciled all operating expenses and other additional rent and
          percentage rent for calendar year 2003 with all Space Lessees under
          the Space Leases, and neither Seller nor any Space Lessee owes any
          payments pursuant to such reconciliation that has not been paid.

               (iii) Exhibit K lists all security or other deposits made by any
          Space Lessee under the Space Leases, and except as set forth in such
          Exhibit K, no security or other deposit made by any Space Lessee under
          the Space Leases has been applied towards the obligations of such
          party in accordance with the Space Leases. No security or other
          deposit is in the form of a letter of credit or any other form other
          than cash. Except as set forth in Exhibit K, no rent has been paid by
          any Space Lessee more than one month in advance.

          commissions are payable with respect to any of the Space Leases,
          either for the term currently in effect or for any renewal,
          substitution, extension or expansion thereunder, and (B) Seller has no
          unperformed obligation to construct or pay or reimburse the costs of

          (j) HOTEL CONTRACTS. Seller has made available to Purchaser correct
     and complete copies of all Hotel Contracts to the extent available to
     Seller. To Seller's actual knowledge, Seller has neither given nor received
     any written notice of any breach or default under any Hotel Contract which
     has not been cured and no event has occurred or circumstance exist which,
     with notice of the passage of time, would result in a breach or default by
     Seller or the other party thereunder.

          (k) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; ACCRUED LIABILITIES. The annual income and
     expense statements for the Property provided to Purchaser for calendar

     Closing Date hereof. Exhibit S attached hereto is a correct and complete
     list of all accrued liabilities related to the Property and the Hotel as of
     the date indicated in such Exhibit S.

          (l) HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES. To Seller's actual knowledge and except as
     set forth in the Books and Records and Exhibit L (i) Seller has not
     received any written notice from any governmental authority or neighboring,
     upgradient or downgradient property owner or other third party regarding
     any non-compliance with or violation of any Environmental Laws with respect
     to the Real Property or the presence or release of hazardous substances in,
     on, under, or from, the Real Property, and (ii) during the Seller's
     ownership of the Property, Seller has not made or been requested in writing
     to make or, to the Seller's actual knowledge, been advised by legal counsel

     hazardous substances to or from the Real Property.

          (m) AGREEMENTS WITH GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. Seller has not entered
     into any unrecorded commitment or agreement with any governmental authority

          deferred compensation, stock option, bonus, incentive, vacation pay,
          tuition reimbursement, severance pay, or

<PAGE>
          other employee benefit plan, trust, agreement, contract, policy or
          commitment (including, without limitation, any pension plan, as
          defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan"), and any welfare
          plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA ("Welfare Plan")), whether
          any of the foregoing is funded, insured or self-funded (1) sponsored
          or maintained by Seller, or any of its affiliates, to the extent such
          affiliate is described in Code Section 414(b), (c) or (m) and
          corresponding Treasury Regulations (each a "Controlled Group Member")
          and covering any Controlled Group Member's active or former employees
          (or their beneficiaries), (ii) to which any Controlled Group Member is
          a party or by which any Controlled Group Member (or any of the rights,
          properties or assets thereof) is bound, or (iii) with respect to which
          any Controlled Group Member has made any payments, contributions or
          commitments or may otherwise have any liability (whether or not such
          Controlled Group Member still maintains such Employee Benefit Plan).

               (ii) Exhibit M provides a complete list of all Employee Benefit
          Plans maintained or contributed to by Seller for the Employees or
          former Employees.

               (iii) There is no pending litigation or governmental
          administrative proceeding (or investigation) or other proceeding
          (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) relating to
          any Employee Benefit Plan.

               (iv) No Welfare Plan provides for continuing benefits or coverage
          for any employee or any beneficiary of an employee after such
          employee's termination of employment, except as may be required by
          Code Section 4980B or Section 601 (et seq.) of ERISA ("COBRA"), or
          under any applicable state law, and at the expense of the employee or
          the beneficiary of the employee.

               (v) Except as otherwise specified in Exhibit N, Seller does not
          contribute to, sponsor or otherwise maintain any Employee Benefit Plan
          which provides benefits or compensation to any Employee.

               (vi) With respect to the multiemployer plan listed on Exhibit N
          as Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union
          Pension Plan (the "Multiemployer Plan"), all contributions required by
          law or by a collective bargaining or other agreement to be made under
          such plan with respect to eligible Employees for all periods through
          the Closing Date will have been made by the Closing Date.

               (vii) (A) With respect to the Multiemployer Plan, Seller has
          delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of the collective
          bargaining agreement pursuant to which Manager is obligated to
          contribute and has requested and prior to the expiration of the
          Inspection Period will deliver a written estimate of the amount of
          potential withdrawal liability of Manager calculated as of the last
          valuation date by the Multiemployer Plan. In the event Manager has not
          received such a written estimate prior to the expiration of the
          Inspection Period, Seller shall have the right to extend the
          expiration of the Inspection Period in


                                      U-20
<PAGE>
               order to obtain such written estimate and the Inspection Period
               shall thereafter expire on the day after the date upon which
               Manager delivers such written estimate to Purchaser.

                    (B) Seller and the Controlled Group Members have not
               received notice from the Multiemployer Plan that such plan is in
               reorganization or is insolvent, that increased contributions may
               be required to avoid a reduction in plan benefits or the
               imposition of any excise tax, or that such plan intends to
               terminate or has terminated.

                    (C) To Seller's knowledge, the Multiemployer Plan is not a
               party to any pending merger or asset or liability transfer or is
               subject to any proceeding brought by the PBGC.

               (viii) With respect to the Multiemployer Plan, Seller and
          Purchaser intend to comply with the requirements of Section 4204 of
          ERISA in order that there shall not be a complete or partial
          withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan as a result of the sale under
          this Agreement. In accordance therewith and notwithstanding anything
          in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and Purchaser agree to the
          following:

                    (A) After the Closing Date Purchaser shall contribute to the
               Multiemployer Plan with respect to the Hotel substantially the
               same number of "contribution base units" for which the Seller had
               an "obligation to contribute" to the Multiemployer Plan (as those
               terms are defined in Sections 4001(a)(ii) and 4212 of ERISA,
               respectively) pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement
               applicable to the Multiemployer Plan;

                    (B) Seller agrees that if Purchaser withdraws from the
               Multiemployer Plan in a complete or partial withdrawal during the
               first five plan years beginning after the Closing, Seller shall
               be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have
               had to the Multiemployer Plan (but for this Section 5.01(n) and
               Section 4204 of ERISA) if the liability of Purchaser with respect
               to the Multiemployer Plan is not paid;

                    (C) Subject to subsection (C)(1) hereof, (1) Purchaser shall
               provide to the Multiemployer Plan for a period of five
               consecutive plan years commencing with the first plan year
               beginning after the Closing, a bond, if required, issued by a
               corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for
               purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or a letter of credit or an
               amount held in escrow, if required, by a bank or similar
               financial institution acceptable to the Multiemployer Plan, in an
               amount satisfying the requirements of ERISA Section
               4204(a)(1)(B);

                         (2) Purchaser may apply for a variance or exemption
               from the bond or escrow requirements of this Subsection (C) and
               Section


                                      U-21
<PAGE>
               4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA in accordance with the applicable rules of
               the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC").

                    (D) Seller and Purchaser further agree:

                         (1) If Purchaser withdraws from the Multiemployer Plan
                    before the last day of the fifth consecutive plan year
                    beginning after the Closing and fails to make any withdrawal
                    liability payment when due, then Seller shall pay to the
                    Multiemployer Plan an amount equal to the payment that would
                    have been due from Seller but for the provisions of ERISA
                    Section 4204;

                         (2) If all, or substantially all, of Seller's assets
                    are distributed, or if Seller is liquidated before the end
                    of the five year plan period described in (B) above, then
                    Purchaser shall provide to the Multiemployer Plan on behalf
                    of Seller to satisfy Seller's obligations under Section
                    4204(a)(3) of ERISA a bond or letter of credit or an amount
                    in escrow held in a reputable bank or similar financial
                    institution acceptable to the Multiemployer Plan, if
                    required, equal to the present value of the withdrawal
                    liability Seller would have had but for this Section
                    5.01(n). If only a portion of Seller's assets are
                    distributed during such period, then a bond or letter of
                    credit or an amount in escrow shall be provided to the
                    Multiemployer Plan by Purchaser on behalf of Seller to
                    satisfy Seller's obligations under Section 4204(a)(3) of
                    ERISA in accordance with applicable regulations prescribed
                    by the PBGC.

                         (3) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless
                    for any loss, cost or expense incurred by Seller in the
                    event Seller has to make payments to the Multiemployer Plan
                    as a result of Purchaser's withdrawal.

                    (E) Notwithstanding Seller's and Purchaser's intent to
               comply with ERISA Section 4204, if any exemption, limitation or
               variance is found to apply to Seller's or Purchaser's withdrawal
               liability or the requirements of Section 4204, the agreements of
               this Section 5.01(n) may be modified or terminated as mutually
               agreed to by Seller and Purchaser; and

                    (F) Seller and Purchaser are unrelated within the meaning of
               ERISA Section 4204.

               As used in this Section 5.01(n)(viii) and to the extent
appropriate to comply with the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA in order
that there shall not be a complete or partial withdrawal from the Multiemployer
Plan as a result of the sale under this Agreement,

                    (A) the term "Seller" shall include the Manager, and

                    (B) the term "Purchaser" shall include the employer of the
               Hotel employees after the closing ("Purchaser's Manager").
               Purchaser's Manager shall be an entity under common control and
               treated as a single employer with Purchaser as determined under
               Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code.

               (ix) Each Employee Benefit Plan complies in all material respects
          with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code and any other
          applicable law governing such Employee Benefit Plan, and each Employee
          Benefit Plan has at all times been properly administered in all
          material respects in accordance with all such requirements of law, and
          in accordance with its terms and the terms of any applicable
          collective bargaining agreement to the extent consistent with all such
          requirements of law. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is intended to
          be qualified is qualified under Code Section 401(a), has received a
          favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
          ("IRS") stating that such Employee Benefit Plan meets the requirements
          of Code Section 401(a) and that the trust associated with such
          Employee Benefit Plan is tax-exempt under Code Section 501(a) and no
          event has occurred which would jeopardize the qualified status of any
          such plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust under Section
          401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively.

               (x) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV of ERISA,
          Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, or is a multiemployer plan (as
          defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) except as indicated on Exhibit
          M.

               (xi) No Controlled Group Member or any organization which is a
          successor or parent corporation of such entities, within the meaning
          of ERISA Section 4069(b), has engaged in a transaction described in
          ERISA Section 4069.

               (xii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
          Agreement will not: (A) entitle any current or former Employee of
          Seller to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any similar
          payment; (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
          the amount of any compensation due to, or in respect of, any current
          or former Employee of Seller; or (C) result in or satisfy a condition
          to the payment of compensation that would, in combination with any
          other payment, result in an "excess parachute payment" within the
          meaning of Code Section 280(G).

          (o) RIGHTS TO PURCHASE. Subject to any renewal, expansion or similar
     rights of Space Lessees under the Space Leases, Seller has not granted any
     option, right of first refusal or similar right in favor of any person or
     entity to purchase or otherwise acquire the Property or any portion thereof
     or interest therein.

     5.02 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER. Purchaser hereby
represents and warrants the following to Seller:

     closing documents to be executed in connection herewith and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except as
     otherwise provided herein, do not require the consent or approval of any
     governmental authority, nor shall such execution and delivery result in a
     breach or violation of any Legal Requirement or conflict with, breach,
     result in a default (or an event which with notice and passage of time or
     both will constitute a default) under, or violate any contract or agreement
     to which Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser is a party or by which it
     or its property is bound.

          (c) PENDING LITIGATION. To Purchaser's actual knowledge, except as
     described in Exhibit N, there are no actions, suits, or proceedings,
     pending or threatened against Purchaser or otherwise affecting the

     if adversely determined might have a material adverse effect on the
     Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. To
     Purchaser's actual knowledge, except as noted in Exhibit O, there is no
     violation of any Legal Requirement with regard to the Purchaser's
     activities.

     5.03 BROKERAGE. Seller and Purchaser each represent and warrant to the
other that it has not had any dealings with any broker, agent, or finder
relating to the sale of the Property or the transactions contemplated hereby
other than CB Richard Ellis (the "BROKER"). Each party agrees to indemnify and
hold the other and its Indemnified Parties harmless against and from any and all
Liabilities incurred by the other party arising out of or resulting from any
breach of the foregoing representation and warranty. Seller shall be responsible
for the Broker's commission in an amount of $125,000 when the Property is sold

termination of this Agreement.

     5.04 DURATION OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
one (1) year and shall not merge into any of the closing documents. Any party
seeking to assert liability under representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement must give notice to the other party in writing prior to the expiration
to such one (1) year period, which notice shall set forth specifically the
representation or warranty allegedly breached and a detailed description of the
alleged breach. In addition, Purchaser shall only be entitled to maintain an
action or claim with respect to a breach of representation or warranty hereunder
if Purchaser has initiated legal proceedings with respect to such claims on or
before the date which is three (3) months after the expiration of such one (1)
year period. All liabilities and obligations of both parties under any
representation or warranty shall lapse and be of no further force or effect with
respect to any

<PAGE>
matter not contained in such a written notice delivered as contemplated above on
or prior to the date that is one (1) year after the Closing Date.

event shall any party have any liability under this Agreement for any
prospective or speculative profits or special, consequential or punitive
damages, whether based upon contract, tort, or negligence or in any other manner
arising from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of any breach, untruth or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty, unless and
until the aggregate amount of all liability and losses arising out of such
breaches, untruths and/or inaccuracies exceeds $25,000.00 whereupon Seller shall
be liable for such breaches, untruths or inaccuracies to the extent the same
exceed $25,000.00, but the liability of Seller for such representation and
warranty shall not exceed, in the aggregate $1,000,000.00. Purchaser assumes the
risk of liability or losses attributable to any such breaches, untruths or
inaccuracies up to and including $25,000.00.

harmless and defend Purchaser, its members, directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives from and against any and all loss, damage, claim,
cost and expense and any other liability including, without limitation,
reasonable accountants' and attorneys' fees, charges and costs, incurred by
Purchaser by reason of, or with respect to (i) any material inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties or agreements made by Seller in
the Agreement, (ii) the non-performance of any covenant or obligation to be
performed by Seller hereunder; (iii) Seller's failure to comply with the bulk
transfer laws of any locality or state or its misapplication of the proceeds of
the Purchase Price in fraud of its creditor; or (iv) any liability imposed upon
Purchaser as transferee of the business or operations of Seller or the assets
being transferred under the Agreement, or otherwise relating to the conduct of
the business and operations of Seller prior to the Closing.

     5.06 LIMITATION OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS.

          (a) In the event Purchaser obtains actual knowledge of any breach of
     Seller's representations or warranties under Article 5 prior to Closing,
     Purchaser shall give written notice thereof to Seller at or prior to the
     Closing. Upon receipt of such notice, Seller may elect to extend the
     Closing for as long as sixty (60) days to enable Seller to attempt to cure
     the condition that gives rise to such breach or otherwise provide evidence
     to Purchaser that the same does not exist. If Seller either does not elect
     to extend or, at or prior to the extended Closing, shall be unable to cure
     such condition or provide such evidence to Purchaser, then Purchaser shall
     elect either (a) to terminate this Agreement on account thereof or (b) to
     close the purchase of the Property and pay the Purchase Price in accordance
     with the terms of this Agreement, but in the case of an election under
     clause (b), Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification under Section
     5.05 on account of such breach subject to the limitations on Seller's
     liability under Section 2.03. The provisions of this Section 5.06(a) shall
     survive the closing of the purchase of the Property.

          (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during the course of Purchaser's
     tests and studies during the Inspection Period Purchaser obtains knowledge
     based upon review of written information from any reports, documents, test
     results, or other written

     consultants, by Seller or any other party, that contain facts or disclosure
     of circumstances that are at variance with any of Seller's representations
     or warranties, and if Purchaser thereafter consummates Closing, Purchaser
     shall be deemed to have accepted such variant facts and circumstances and
     Seller's representations and warranties shall be deemed excised or modified
     to comport with such variant facts and circumstances.

     be prorated (accrual basis) as of the Cut-off Time provided, however, that
     if any taxes or assessments relating to the period prior to the Closing are
     paid in installments, then Seller shall pay on or before Closing Date any
     remaining installments thereof. If the amount of any such item is not
     ascertainable on the Closing, the adjustment therefor shall be based on the
     most recent available bill and assessment notice and shall be reprorated
     upon receipt of the actual bill, as provided in this subsection (b), which
     obligation shall survive the Closing Date and not be extinguished as of the
     Cut-Off Time.

<PAGE>
          (c) UTILITY CONTRACTS. Telephone and telex contracts and contracts for
     the supply of heat, steam, electric power, gas, lighting and any other
     utility service shall be prorated as of the Cut-off Time, with Seller
     receiving a credit for each deposit, if any, made by Seller as security
     under any such public service contracts if the same is transferable and
     provided such deposit remains on account for the benefit of Purchaser.
     Where possible, readings as of the Cut-off Time (or as close thereto as
     practicable) will be secured for all utilities on the Closing Date.

          (d) HOTEL CONTRACTS. Subject to Section 7.01(a) with respect to
     accounts payable, any amounts prepaid, payable or accrued under any Hotel
     Contracts shall be prorated as of the Cut-off Time. Notwithstanding the
     foregoing, Purchaser shall pay or credit Seller only for those Hotel
     Contract prepaid expenses that are in the categories listed in Exhibit U
     attached hereto, which Exhibit U lists prepaid expenses as of the date
     hereof and there shall be no proration on account of any other prepaid
     expenses.

          (e) SPACE LEASES. Any rents and other amounts payable under the Space
     Leases, in each case as and when actually received, shall be prorated as of
     the Cut-off Time between Seller and Purchaser. Purchaser shall receive a
     credit for all prepaid rents and other amounts for periods from and after
     the Closing Date and all security deposits held by Seller under the Space
     Leases which are not transferred to Purchaser, and Purchaser thereafter
     shall be obligated to refund or apply such deposits in accordance with the
     terms of such Space Leases. Rents and other amounts payable under the Space
     Leases which are delinquent as of the Closing Date shall not be pro rated
     as of the Cut-off Time. To the extent that Purchaser receives rents or
     other payments payable under the Space Leases on or after the Closing Date,
     such payments shall be applied first towards the payment in full of all
     rents and other amounts due to Purchaser with respect to periods following
     the Cut-off Time, with the balance applied to delinquent rents or other
     amounts due to Seller for the period prior to the Cut-off Time, with
     Seller's share thereof being promptly delivered to Seller by Purchaser.
     Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect any such
     delinquent rents after the Closing. With respect to any Space Leases which
     provide for the payment of percentage rent by the tenant thereunder, the
     parties shall use good faith efforts to prorate such percentage rent as of
     the Closing and, within twenty (20) days after Purchaser completes the
     annual reconciliation of such percentage rent payments with each such
     tenant, the parties agree to reprorate percentage rent based on the actual
     percentage rent paid by such tenant, and the Party in whose favor such
     original proration was made shall refund such difference to the other Party
     promptly thereafter.

          (f) LICENSE FEES. Fees paid or payable for Permits (other than
     Excluded Permits) shall be prorated as of the Cut-off Time.

          (g) BOOKINGS DEPOSITS AND MISCELLANEOUS HOTEL MATTERS. Purchaser shall
     receive a credit for advance payments or deposits, if any, made pursuant to
     any Bookings that relate to a period after the Cut-Off Time.


                                      U-31
<PAGE>
          (h) EMPLOYMENT. Except as provided herein below, Seller shall be
     responsible for, and when due and payable as required by law, shall pay all
     Compensation to any Hotel Employee through the Cut-Off Time.

          (i) SUPPLIES AND CONSUMABLES. Seller shall receive a credit at Closing
     to the extent of the value of all unopened Supplies and Consumables at the
     Hotel as of Closing (valued at Seller's actual cost).

          (j) OTHER. Such other items as are expressly provided to be prorated
     or otherwise adjusted or credited for in other this Agreement shall be so
     prorated, adjusted or credited.

     7.02 PAYMENT. Any net credit due to Seller as a result of the adjustments
and prorations under Section 7.01 shall be paid to Seller in cash at the time of
Closing. Any net credit due to Purchaser as a result of the adjustments and
prorations under Section 7.01 shall be credited against the Purchase Price at
the time of Closing.

     7.03 CLOSING STATEMENTS.

          (a) PREPARATION. Each party shall cause its designated representatives
     to enter the Hotel only at reasonable times and without unreasonably
     interfering with operations, both before and after the Closing Date, for
     the purpose of making such inventories, examinations, and audits of the
     Hotel, and of the Books and Records, as they deem necessary to make the
     adjustments and prorations required under this Article VII, or under any
     other provisions of this Agreement. Based upon such inventories,
     examinations, and audits, two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
     representatives of the parties shall jointly prepare a preliminary closing
     statement (the "PRELIMINARY CLOSING STATEMENT") which shall show the net
     amount due either to Seller or Purchaser as a result thereof, and such net
     amount will be added to, or subtracted from the payment of the Purchase
     Price to be paid to Seller pursuant to Section 3.01 hereof. Within thirty
     (30) days following the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall agree on a
     final closing statement (the "FINAL CLOSING STATEMENT") setting forth the
     final determination of all items to be included on the Closing Statement
     (subject to any subsequent adjustments for percentage rent under any Space
     Lease pursuant to Section 7.01(e)). The net amount due Seller or Purchaser,
     if any, by reason of adjustments to the Preliminary Closing Statement as
     shown in the Final Closing Statement, shall be paid in cash by the party
     obligated therefor within ten (10) days following the date of the Final
     Closing Statement.

          (b) DISPUTES. In the event the representatives of the parties are
     unable to reach agreement with respect to preparation of the Preliminary
     Closing Statement then, except as hereinafter provided, the disputed amount
     shall be held in a joint order Escrow, pending agreement of the parties or
     a determination pursuant to Section 7.03(b), and the Closing shall occur as
     scheduled. Purchaser shall be required to deposit in the Escrow any
     additional sum of the disputed amount which it may be required to pay and
     Seller shall be required to deposit in the Escrow any sum of the disputed
     amount which it may be required to credit or pay to Purchaser. Any such
     dispute shall survive and be subject


                                      U-32
<PAGE>
     to later resolution pursuant to this Section 7.03. In the event the
     representatives of the parties are unable to reach agreement with respect
     to either the Preliminary Closing Statement or the Final Closing Statement,
     the parties shall submit their dispute to a firm of independent certified
     public accountants of recognized standing in the hotel industry mutually
     acceptable to Seller and Purchaser. If Seller and Purchaser cannot agree on
     such firm of independent certified public accounts within five (5) Business
     Days after notice from either party requesting such agreement, then such
     dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration, and either party may
     request that the then president or managing director of the New York Office
     of the American Arbitration Association (or any successor organization, or
     if no successor organization exists, an organization composed of persons of
     similar qualifications) to appoint an independent individual arbitrator
     with a minimum of ten (10) years' personal experience directly relevant to
     the purchase and sale of assets similar to the Hotel, and the determination
     of such arbitrator shall be final and binding on Seller and Purchaser and
     shall be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. The fees and
     expenses of the arbitrator shall be borne by the non-prevailing party, as
     determined by the arbitrator.

          (c) PERIOD FOR RECALCULATION. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any
     time within six (6) months following the Closing Date, either party
     discovers any items which should have been included in the Final Closing
     Statement but were omitted therefrom, or discovers any items that were
     improperly prorated in the Final Closing Statement, then such items shall
     be adjusted in the same manner as if their existence or such improper
     proration had been known at the time of the preparation of the Final
     Closing Statement. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to any items
     which, by their nature, cannot be finally determined within the periods
     specified including, without limitation, real estate taxes and adjustments
     following such six (6) month period pursuant to Section 7.01(e) with
     respect to percentage rent under Space Leases.

                       CONDITIONS TO SELLER'S OBLIGATIONS

     8.01 CONDITIONS. Seller's obligation to close the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of the following
conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by Seller in writing:

          (a) PURCHASER'S COMPLIANCE WITH OBLIGATIONS. Purchaser shall have
     complied with all material Obligations required by this Agreement to be
     complied with by Purchaser.

          (b) TRUTH OF PURCHASER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
     representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement
     were true in all material respects when made, and are true in all material
     respects on the Closing Date, and Seller shall have received a certificate
     to that effect signed by Purchaser. In the event any of the Purchaser's
     representations become untrue during the term of the Agreement, Seller may
     terminate this Agreement without thereby waiving any right or remedy.

     8.02 FAILURE OF SELLER CLOSING CONDITION. Subject to the provisions of
Section 12.01, if any closing condition set forth in Section 8.01(a) and Section
8.01(b) is not satisfied at Closing and provided all conditions of Article IX
have been satisfied by Seller, then Seller shall have the right either (i) to
terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to such effect to
Purchaser, in which case the Deposit shall be disbursed to Seller in accordance
with Article XVI as Seller's sole remedy at law or in equity, and the parties
shall have no further rights or obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) to
waive such closing condition at or prior to Closing.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                      CONDITIONS TO PURCHASER'S OBLIGATIONS

     9.01 CONDITIONS. Purchaser's obligation to close the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to the satisfaction of each of
the following conditions, any one or more of which may be waived by Purchaser in
writing:

          (a) SELLER'S COMPLIANCE WITH OBLIGATIONS. Seller shall have complied
     with all material Obligations required by this Agreement to be complied
     with by Seller.

          (b) TRUTH OF SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The
     representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement were
     true in all material respects when made, and continue to be true in all
     material respects on the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall have received a
     certificate to that effect signed by Seller. If the representations and
     warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement are no longer true in all
     material respects as of Closing due to changes in fact since the date of
     this Agreement, then Seller shall so indicate in its update certificate
     provided at Closing, and any such changes shall be subject to the approval
     of Purchaser in its reasonable discretion.

     9.02 FAILURE OF PURCHASER CLOSING CONDITION. Subject to the provisions of
Section 12.01, if any closing condition set forth in Section 9.01 is not
satisfied at Closing, then Purchaser shall have the right either (i) to
terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to such effect to Seller,
in which case, subject to the provisions of Section 3.01(d), the Deposit shall
be refunded to Purchaser or (ii) to waive such closing condition at or prior to
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the failed closing condition is
reasonably susceptible to cure by Seller, then Seller shall have the one time
right to extend the Closing Date for up to thirty (30) days in order to allow
such cure by giving notice to such effect to Purchaser on or before the
scheduled Closing Date, which notice shall include a covenant of Seller to use
all commercially reasonable diligent efforts to effect such cure.

                     ACTIONS AND OPERATIONS PENDING CLOSING

     10.01 ACTIONS AND OPERATIONS PENDING CLOSING. Seller agrees that at all
times prior to the Closing Date:

          (a) Subject to conditions beyond Seller's reasonable control (which
     the parties agree shall not include the unavailability of funds), during
     the pendency of this


                                      U-34
<PAGE>
     Agreement the Hotel will continue to be operated and maintained
     substantially in accordance with Present Standards including, without
     limitation, (i) maintaining the inventories of Fixtures and Tangible
     Personal Property, Inventory, Consumables, Supplies and Miscellaneous Hotel
     Assets, (ii) performing maintenance and repairs to the Improvements and
     tangible Personal Property; (iii) implementing the current marketing
     program for the Hotel; (v) maintaining the level of customer service at the
     Hotel; (vi) maintaining the level of security at the Real Property; and
     (vii) continuing to take all Bookings in the ordinary course of business.
     Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall perform its obligations under,
     and otherwise comply with, the Space Leases, the Hotel Contracts, the
     Permits, any license agreements for IT Systems, the Liquor License, the
     Management Agreement, the Bookings and Legal Requirements, in each case in
     all material respects; provided, however, that the Seller shall have the
     right to exercise any of its rights under any of the foregoing. From the
     date of this Agreement until the Closing or earlier termination of this
     Agreement, Seller shall promptly provide Purchaser of any written notices
     or complaints Seller receives concerning the presence of toxic mold or
     fungi at the Real Property or other written claims made with respect to
     environmental matters at the Real Property.

          (b) From and after the Opening of Escrow, Seller will not enter into
     any new Hotel Contract or Space Lease, or cancel, modify, or renew any
     existing Hotel Contract or Space Lease or Permitted Exception, without the
     prior written consent of Purchaser, which Purchaser shall not unreasonably
     withhold, condition or delay prior to the expiration of the Inspection
     Period but which Purchaser may withhold in its sole and absolute discretion
     after the expiration of the Inspection Period; provided, however, that
     Purchaser's consent shall not be required for any Hotel Contract entered
     into with a third party prior to the expiration of the Inspection Period as
     long as (i) such Hotel Contract is cancelable upon not more than thirty
     (30) days notice without penalty or premium payment and (ii) Seller
     promptly gives notice to Purchaser of such Hotel Contract. If Purchaser
     fails to respond to a request for consent within ten (10) days after
     receipt of such request, such consent shall be deemed given.

          (c) Seller shall have the right, without notice to or consent of
     Purchaser, to make Bookings in the ordinary course of business, at no less
     than the Hotel's standard rates (including customary discounted rates as
     long as such discounted rates are bona fide third party Bookings).

          (d) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve in
     force all existing Permits and to cause all those expiring on or before the
     Closing Date to be renewed prior to the Closing Date. If any such Permit
     shall be suspended or revoked, Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser and
     shall take commercially reasonable measures to cause the reinstatement of
     such Permit.

          (e) Seller will maintain in effect all policies of casualty and
     liability insurance, or similar policies of insurance, with the same limits
     of coverage which it now carries with respect to the Hotel.

<PAGE>
          (f) Seller shall not remove any Fixtures and Tangible Personal
     Property from the Property (other than in the ordinary course of business
     in which case adequate replacements shall have been made).

          (g) Seller shall not alter the terms and conditions of the employment
     of any Employees, except in accordance with past practice consistently
     applied.

          (h) Seller shall not (i) create or allow any lien or similar
     encumbrance to be placed against the Property, and shall use commercially
     reasonable efforts to promptly discharge any such encumbrance that may
     arise, (ii) grant or enter into any easement, restrictive covenant or
     similar agreement affecting title to the Real Property without Purchaser's
     prior written consent in its sole but good faith discretion, or (iii)
     cancel, modify, or renew any existing Permitted Exception without
     Purchaser's prior written consent in its sole but good faith discretion.

                             CASUALTIES AND TAKINGS

     11.01 CASUALTIES.

          (a) If any damage to the Property shall occur prior to the Closing
     Date by reason of fire, windstorm, earthquake, hail, explosion or other
     casualty, and if the cost of repairing such damage will equal or exceed Two
     Million Dollars ($2,000,000), Purchaser may elect to (i) terminate this
     Agreement by giving written notice to Seller, in which event, subject to
     the provisions of Section 3.01(d), the Deposit shall be returned to
     Purchaser and neither party shall have any further Obligations or liability
     whatsoever to the other hereunder or (ii) receive an assignment of all of
     Seller's rights to any insurance proceeds and claims (including business
     interruption proceeds for the period after Closing) relating to such damage
     and acquire the Property without any adjustment in the Purchase Price in
     connection therewith.

          (b) If the cost of repairing such damage will not exceed Two Million
     Dollars ($2,000,000), the transactions contemplated hereby shall close
     without any adjustment in the Purchase Price in connection therewith and
     Purchaser shall receive an assignment of all of Seller's rights to any
     insurance proceeds or claims (including business interruption proceeds for
     any period after the Closing Date) except those proceeds allocable to costs
     incurred by, and lost profits of Seller for the period prior to Closing;
     provided, however, that the Purchaser shall receive a credit against the
     Purchase in the amount of any deductible or other uninsured amount with
     respect to any such damage.

     11.02 TAKINGS. If, prior to the Closing Date, all or any portion of the
Real Property is taken by eminent domain or by an act of governmental authority,
Seller shall promptly give Purchaser written notice thereof, and the following
shall apply:

          (a) If a material part of the Real Property is taken, either party
     may, within five (5) days after the giving of Seller's notice, by written
     notice to the other, elect to terminate this Agreement. In the event that
     either party shall so elect, subject to the


                                      U-36
<PAGE>
     provisions of Section 3.01(d), the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser
     whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and neither party hereto shall
     have any further rights or obligations hereunder.

          (b) If a material part of the Real Property is taken but neither party
     elects to terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) above, or if
     an immaterial part of the Real Property is taken by an act of governmental
     authority, neither party shall have any right to terminate this Agreement,
     and the parties shall nonetheless proceed to the Closing in accordance with
     this Agreement, without any abatement of the Purchase Price or any
     liability or obligation on the part of Seller by reason of such taking,
     provided, however, that Seller shall, at the Closing, (i) assign and turn
     over, and Purchaser shall be entitled to receive and keep, the net proceeds
     of any award or other proceeds of such taking which may have been collected
     by Seller as a result of such taking, less any portion thereof applied to
     the cost of repairs necessitated by such taking and made by Seller prior to
     the Closing, or (ii) if no award or other proceeds shall have been
     collected, deliver to Purchaser an assignment of Seller's right to any such
     award or other proceeds which may be payable to Seller as a result of such
     taking and all claims related thereto, less an amount equal to the cost of
     any repairs necessitated by such taking and made by Seller prior to the
     Closing, which amount shall be paid to Seller by Purchaser at the Closing.

          (c) For the purposes hereof, a "material part" shall be deemed to mean
     any taking (i) which causes a reduction in the size of any of the buildings
     comprising the Real Property or materially interferes with the present use
     and operation of any of the buildings comprising the Real Property (ii)
     which results in the elimination of the sole or any required means of legal
     ingress and/or egress from the Real Property, to public roads, with no
     comparable, convenient, legal substitute ingress and/or egress being
     available, or (iii) which results in the elimination of any parking on the
     Land unless Purchaser concludes in its sole but good faith discretion that
     such parking is not required for the continued operation of the Hotel.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                              ADDITIONAL COVENANTS

     12.01 LIQUOR LICENSE; OTHER PERMITS; CONSENTS AND CLOSING CONDITIONS.
Purchaser and Seller shall use diligent, good faith efforts to effect the
transfer of the existing Liquor License to Purchaser or its designee on the
Closing Date or to enable Purchaser or its designee to obtain a new Liquor
License effective on the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees to pay all fees and
other amounts payable to any governmental authority in connection with the
transfer of the existing Liquor License. If Seller engages counsel in connection
with the transfer of the existing Liquor License, Purchaser shall be responsible
for the fees of such counsel. As promptly as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser or its designee shall complete, execute and file with
the applicable liquor licensing authority all necessary applications for
transfer of the Liquor License or the issuance of a new Liquor License.
Purchaser specifically acknowledges and agrees that the transfer of the Liquor
License to Purchaser on the Closing Date shall not be a condition to Purchaser's
obligation to close the transaction contemplated under this Agreement. Purchaser
and Seller shall use diligent, good faith efforts to effect the


                                      U-37
<PAGE>
transfer of the other Permits to Purchaser (other than the Excluded Permits) and
to enable Purchaser to obtain new Permits to replace any Excluded Permits.
Purchaser agrees to pay all out-of-pocket third party fees, charges, and related
costs in connection with the transfer of such Permits. Seller and Purchaser
shall use diligent, good faith efforts to obtain any other consent required to
be obtained from any third party in order to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including, without limitation, any consent
required for the assignment of any license for the use of any of the IT Systems
or any Hotel Contract; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to
incur any unreimbursed material out-of-pocket costs in connection with obtaining
any such consent. It is understood that, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, obtaining any such consent is not a condition precedent to the
Closing and the failure to obtain any such consent shall not entitle Purchaser
to terminate this Agreement or defer the Closing Date or seek any other remedy.
Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees to act in good faith and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy all conditions to Closing set forth in Article
VIII and IX, as applicable.

     12.02 GUEST BAGGAGE. All baggage, boxes and similar items of guests who are
still in the Hotel on the Closing Date, which has been checked with or left in
the care of Seller shall be inventoried, sealed, and tagged jointly by Seller
and Purchaser on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for and hereby
indemnifies Seller and its Indemnified Parties against any Liabilities in
connection with such baggage arising out of the acts of omissions of Purchaser
or its Affiliates (or any of their employees or agents) after the Closing Date.
Seller hereby indemnifies Purchaser and its Indemnified Parties against any
Liabilities in connection with baggage arising out of the acts or omissions of
Seller or its Affiliates (or any of their employees or agents) prior to the
Closing Date. The provisions of this Section 12.02 shall survive Closing.

     12.03 SAFE DEPOSITS. Immediately after the Closing, Seller shall send
written notice to guests or tenants or other persons who have safe deposit
boxes, if any, advising of the sale of the Hotel to Purchaser and requesting
immediate removal of the contents thereof or the removal thereof and concurrent
re-deposit of such contents pursuant to new safe deposit agreements with
Purchaser. Seller shall have a representative present when the boxes are opened,
in the presence of a representative of the Purchaser. Any property contained in
the safe deposit boxes after such re-deposit shall be the responsibility of
Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Indemnified Parties from and against any Liabilities arising out of or with
respect to such property. Upon Closing, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser all
keys in Seller's possession or control for all safe deposit boxes not then in
use and a list of all safe deposit boxes which are then in use but where the
contents have not been removed and re-deposited as set forth above, including
the name and room number of such depositor. Seller and Purchaser shall continue
to use reasonable efforts to cause such depositors to remove the contents and
re-deposit such contents pursuant to new safe deposit agreements with Purchaser
as set forth above. Seller shall continue to be responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Indemnified Parties from and
against any Liabilities arising out of or with respect to the contents of any
safe deposit box prior to the time that the contents thereof are removed and
re-deposited pursuant to a new safe deposit agreement with Purchaser as set
forth above.

     12.04 TAX APPEAL PROCEEDINGS. Seller shall be entitled to receive and
retain the proceeds from any tax appeals or protests for tax fiscal years ending
prior to the tax fiscal year ending in which the Closing Date occurs. Seller
shall continue to process any pending appeals or

protests with respect to the tax fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs,
and Purchaser shall have the right to participate therein with counsel of its
choosing at Purchaser's cost and expense. Seller shall have no right after the
date of this Agreement to file or otherwise initiate any appeal or protest with
respect to the property taxes on the Property for the tax fiscal year in which
the Closing Date occurs, and only Purchaser shall have the right to file or
otherwise initiate any such appeal or protest after the date hereof. Any net
proceeds obtained from any such proceeding with the respect to the tax fiscal
year in which the Closing Date occurs, after payment of attorneys' fees and
other costs associated with such process, will be prorated between the parties,
when received, as of the Closing Date.

     12.05 TERMINATION OF MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. Seller shall terminate the
Management Agreement on or before Closing at its sole cost and expense.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                              DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

     13.01 SELLER'S REMEDIES. If Purchaser fails to perform its material
obligations under this Agreement for any reason except a default by Seller or
the failure of any condition precedent to Purchaser's obligations, Seller shall
be entitled as its sole remedy at law or in equity to terminate this Agreement
and receive the Deposit and interest thereon as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, in full satisfaction of any claims against Purchaser. Seller and
Purchaser agree that the Seller's damages resulting from Purchaser's default are
difficult to determine, and the amount of the Deposit is a fair estimate of
those damages.

     13.02 PURCHASER'S REMEDIES. If Seller fails to perform its obligations
under this Agreement for any reason except the failure of any condition
precedent to Seller's obligations under this Agreement or Purchaser's default of
its material obligations, then Purchaser's sole remedies shall be: (a) to
terminate this Agreement by giving Seller written notice of such election prior
to or at Closing, whereupon (i) subject to the provisions of Section 3.01(d),
the Escrow Company shall promptly return to Purchaser the Deposit, and (ii)
Purchaser shall be entitled to payment by Seller of all actual out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Purchaser in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement; (b) to obtain a court order for specific performance; or (c) to
waive the default and close.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                    EMPLOYEES

     At Closing, Seller or Seller's Manager shall terminate or cause to be
terminated the employment of all Employees. Purchaser shall employ from and
after the Closing Date such of the Employees as Purchaser determines, in its
sole and absolute discretion, on such terms and conditions as Purchaser may
determine ("NEW HIRES"). Nothing in this provision shall be construed to limit
Purchaser's right to terminate, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, the New
Hires subsequent to the Closing Date, subject to the requirements of applicable
law and the Collective Bargaining Agreements that Purchaser has agreed to
assume. Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against
any violations of the Worker Adjustment


                                      U-39
<PAGE>
and Retraining Notification Act, 29 USC Section 2101 et seq., ("WARN ACT") or
the Illinois Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 820 ILCS65
("ILLINOIS WARN") arising as a result of its actions subsequent to the Closing
Date. No employees shall be transferred. Any New Hires hired by the Purchaser
shall in all respects be and remain "at will" employees, and Purchaser shall
have the right to dismiss such employees at any time in its sole discretion and
Seller and Seller's Manager each hereby acknowledges and agrees that none of its
respective employee benefit programs are being assumed or continued by
Purchaser. Nothing in this Section 14.01 is intended to, or shall, confer on any
person or entity not a party of this Agreement any rights or benefits. Seller
shall, upon termination of the New Hires as set forth above, cause Seller's
Manager to pay the employees all earned wages, vacation pay, if any, or any
other compensation payable to the New Hires under federal and Illinois wage and
hour laws, that is due and payable.

                                   ARTICLE XV

     15.02 SURVIVAL. Subject to Section 5.03, all of the representations,
warranties, obligations, covenants, agreements, undertakings, and
indemnifications of Seller and Purchaser contained in this Agreement and in any
closing documents delivered in connection with this Agreement shall survive the
Closing.

     15.03 CONSTRUCTION. This Agreement shall not be construed more strictly
against one party than against the other, merely by virtue of the fact that it
may have been prepared primarily by counsel for one of the parties, it being
recognized that both Purchaser and Seller have contributed substantially and
materially to the preparation of this Agreement.

     15.04 PUBLICITY. Unless required by law or necessary securities filings,
subject to Purchaser's right to perform certain marketing activities pursuant to
Section 3.01(d) of this Agreement, all notices to third parties and all other
publicity prior to Closing concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be jointly planned and coordinated by and between Purchaser and
Seller. Neither party shall act unilaterally in this regard without the prior
written approval of the other; however, this approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Purchaser may issue press releases after the Closing,
provided that such press releases do not contain references to either Boykin
Lodging Company or AEW Capital Management, L.P.

     15.05 ASSIGNMENT. Neither all nor any portion of Purchaser's interest under
this Agreement may be sold, assigned, encumbered, conveyed, or otherwise
transferred, whether directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, or by
operation of law or otherwise including, without limitation, by a transfer of
all or substantially all of the interest in Purchaser (collectively, a
"TRANSFER"), without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be
granted or denied in Seller's sole and absolute discretion. Any attempted
Transfer without


                                      U-41
<PAGE>
Seller's consent shall be null and void. Any request by Purchaser for Seller's
consent to a Transfer shall set forth in writing the details of the proposed
Transfer, including, without limitation, the name, ownership, and financial
condition of the prospective transferee and the financial details of the
proposed Transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser, upon prior written
notice to Seller given not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing (which time period is agreed to be material and is required to permit
Seller properly to prepare, execute and deliver the items required to be
delivered by it pursuant to this Agreement) which notice specifies the exact
legal name, address and any other information necessary for the preparation of
the closing documents to be delivered under this Agreement, may assign its
rights and delegate its duties under this Agreement to an entity which is owned
or controlled by or under common control with, directly or indirectly,
Purchaser, the principals of Purchaser and/or investors with Purchaser or the
principals of Purchaser, for the purposes of closing on the transaction provided
that such assignment shall not delay the Closing and shall not require Seller to
obtain any additional or revised third party consents, certificates or
approvals. In the event Purchaser so assigns and delegates its rights and duties
under this Agreement, it shall deliver to Seller at or prior to Closing an
instrument of assignment and assumption evidencing such assignment and
delegation. In addition, Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of all
Transfer documentation, certified by Purchaser to be true, correct, and
complete, and with all other information which Seller may reasonably request. No
transfer, whether with or without Seller's consent: (i) shall operate to release
Purchaser or alter Purchaser's primary liability to perform the obligations of
Purchaser under this Agreement or (ii) shall cause Seller to incur any cost or
other economic detriment in connection with such Transfer. Purchaser shall pay
any and all additional costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees, charges, and disbursements) incurred by Seller that
would not otherwise have been incurred by Seller had Purchaser not caused a
Transfer. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns.

     15.06 COUNTERPARTS; FACSIMILE EXECUTION; INTEGRATION. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall constitute an
original but all of which, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
instrument. A party may deliver executed signature pages to this Agreement by
facsimile transmission to the other party, which facsimile copies shall be
deemed to be an original executed signature page binding on the party that so
delivered the executed signature page by facsimile. This Agreement (including
all exhibits) contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, supersedes all prior letters of intent,
understandings, or other agreement, whether written or oral, if any, with
respect thereto and may not be amended, supplemented, or terminated, nor shall
any Obligation hereunder or condition hereof be deemed waived, except by a
written instrument to such effect signed by the party to be charged.

     15.07 GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION AND VENUE. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois,
without giving effect to any principles regarding conflict of laws. Any
litigation or other court proceeding with respect to any matter arising from or
in connection with this agreement shall be conducted in the Illinois State
Superior Court in Cook County or The United States District Court for the
Northern District Court in the State of Illinois, and each of Seller (for itself
and its Indemnified Parties)


                                      U-42
<PAGE>
and Purchaser (for itself and its Indemnified Parties) hereby submit to
jurisdiction and consent to venue in such courts, and waive any defense based on
forum non conveniens.

     15.08 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From the date of this Agreement until the Closing
or termination of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
transaction described in this Agreement, including, without limitation, (a)
effecting all registrations and filings required under this Agreement or Legal
Requirements, and (c) satisfying the Closing Conditions set forth in this
Agreement. After the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (at no cost or expense to such Party, other than any de
minimis cost or expense or any cost or expense which the requesting Party agrees
in writing to reimburse) to further effect the transaction contemplated in this
Agreement.

     15.09 CONFIDENTIALITY. Unless the other party specifically and expressly
otherwise agrees in writing, each party hereby agrees that all information
regarding the Property or this transaction, of whatsoever nature made available
to it ("PROPRIETARY INFORMATION") is confidential and shall not be disclosed to
any other person except those reasonably assisting such party with the
transaction, Purchaser's investors or Purchaser's lender, if any (and then only
upon Purchaser making such person aware of the confidentiality restriction and
procuring such person's agreement to be bound thereby). In the event that the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement fails to close for any reason
whatsoever, Purchaser agrees to return to Seller, or cause to be returned to
Seller, all Proprietary Information that was provided to Purchaser by Seller and
Purchaser agrees not to retain any copy of such Proprietary Information provided
to it by Seller and to instruct all persons and entities that have received a
copy or copies of such Proprietary Information to immediately destroy such
Proprietary Information. Further, Purchaser agrees not to use or allow to be
used any Proprietary Information for any purpose other than to determine whether
to proceed with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or if the same
is consummated, in connection with the operation of the Property post-Closing.
The provisions of this Section 15.09 shall survive the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement.

     15.10 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any action or proceeding is commenced by either
party to enforce their rights under this Agreement or to collect damages as a
result of the breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the prevailing
party in such action or proceeding, including any bankruptcy, insolvency or
appellate proceedings, shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs and
expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and court
costs, in addition to any other relief awarded by the court.

     15.11 PREVAILING PARTY. If any litigation or other court action,
arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding is commenced by any party to
enforce its rights under this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement against any other party, all fees, costs and expenses, including,
without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the
prevailing party in such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding shall be
reimbursed by the losing party; provided, that if a party to such litigation,
action, arbitration or proceeding prevails in part, and loses in part, the
court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such litigation, action,
arbitration or proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such party on an equitable basis.

<PAGE>
     15.12 DELIVERY OF DRAFTS NOT AN OFFER. The preparation and/or delivery of
unsigned drafts of this Agreement shall not create any legally binding rights in
the Property and/or obligations of the parties, and Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge that this Agreement shall be of no effect until it is duly executed
and delivered by both Purchaser and Seller.

     15.13 SEVERABILITY. This Agreement is intended to be performed in
accordance with, and only to the extent permitted by, all applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, and regulations. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall, for any reason and to
any extent be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted
by law.

                                  ARTICLE XVI

                            GENERAL ESCROW PROVISIONS

     16.01 GENERAL ESCROW PROVISIONS. The obligations and rights of the Escrow
Company under this Agreement shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions:

          (a) The duties and obligations of Escrow Company shall be determined
     solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and no implied duties or
     obligations shall be implied against Escrow Company. Further, Escrow
     Company shall be under no obligation to refer to any other document between
     or among Purchaser and Seller referred to in or related to this Agreement,
     unless Escrow Company is provided with a copy of such document and consents
     thereto in writing.

          (b) Escrow Company shall not be liable to anyone by reason of any
     error of judgment, or for any act done or step taken or omitted by Escrow
     Company in good faith, or for any mistake of fact or law, or for anything
     which Escrow Company may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith,
     unless caused by or arising out of Escrow Company's actual and intentional
     misconduct or gross negligence.

          (c) Escrow Company shall be entitled to rely, and shall be protected
     in acting in reliance, upon any writing furnished to Escrow Company by
     either Purchaser or Seller and shall be entitled to treat as genuine, and
     as the document it purports to be, any letter, paper or other document
     furnished to Escrow Company. Escrow Company may rely on any affidavit of
     either Purchaser or Seller or any other person as to the existence of any
     facts stated therein to be known by the affiant.

          (d) If Seller shall become entitled to retain or receive the Deposit
     or other amount paid under this Agreement, Escrow Company shall pay the
     same to Seller together with all interest earned thereon and if Purchaser
     shall become entitled to a return of the Deposit or other amount paid under
     this Agreement, Escrow Company shall pay the same to Purchaser together
     with all interest earned thereon; provided, however, that no disbursement
     pursuant to this subsection shall be made by Escrow Company until the third
     (3rd) Business Day following the receipt or deemed receipt of notice by
     Seller and Purchaser from Escrow Company of its intention to so disburse,
     and disbursement made


                                      U-44
<PAGE>
     by Escrow Company after the passage of such three (3) Business Day period
     shall relieve Escrow Company from all liability in connection with such
     disbursement unless such disbursement is proscribed by order of a court of
     competent jurisdiction or objected to in writing by Seller or Purchaser. If
     such disbursement is objected to in writing by Seller or Purchaser within
     such three (3) Business Day period, then Escrow Company shall not make such
     disbursement until unanimously instructed in writing by Purchaser and
     Seller, or is directed to make such disbursement by a court of competent
     jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, no
     such notice by Escrow Company shall be given and no notice of objection may
     or shall be given by Seller in the event Purchaser terminates this
     Agreement as set forth in Section 4.04, and in such event Escrow Company
     shall promptly pay the Deposit together with all interest thereon to
     Purchaser.

          (e) In the event of any disagreement between Purchaser and Seller
     resulting in adverse claims and demands being made in connection with or
     against the funds held in escrow, Escrow Company shall refuse to comply
     with the claims or demands of either party until such disagreement is
     finally resolved (i) by a court of competent jurisdiction (in proceedings
     which Escrow Company or any other party may initiate, it being understood
     and agreed by Purchaser and Seller that Escrow Company has authority (but
     not the obligation) to initiate such proceedings), or (ii) by an arbitrator
     in the event that Purchaser and Seller mutually and jointly determine to
     submit the dispute to arbitration pursuant to the rules of the American
     Arbitration Association, and in so doing Escrow Company shall not be or
     become liable to a party, or (iii) by written settlement between Purchaser
     and Seller.

          (f) Purchaser and Seller each agree to jointly and severally indemnify
     and hold harmless Escrow Company against any and all losses, liabilities,
     costs (including legal fees) and other expenses in any way incurred by
     Escrow Company (except to the extent the Escrow Company willfully
     disregards any provision of this Agreement to which it is bound) in
     connection with or as a result of any disagreement between Purchaser and
     Seller under this Agreement or otherwise incurred by Escrow Company in any
     way on account of its role as Escrow Company.

          (g) Escrow Company in its sole discretion shall have the right to
     resign as Escrow Company under this Agreement, provided that it shall
     provide both Purchaser and Seller with at least thirty (30) days written
     notice of such resignation pursuant to the notice provisions of this
     Agreement. Upon any such resignation, Escrow Company shall transfer the
     Deposit and any interest earned thereon to a successor Escrow Company
     jointly approved by Purchaser and Seller, whereupon the original Escrow
     Company shall have no further obligation or liability whatsoever as Escrow
     Company under this Agreement.

          (h) The parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Federal Deposit
     Insurance for the Deposit, if any, is limited to a cumulative maximum
     amount of $100,000 for each individual depositor for all of the depositor's
     accounts at the same or related institution. The parties further hereby
     acknowledge and agree that certain banking instruments such as, but not
     limited to, repurchase agreements and letters of credit, are not covered at
     all


                                      U-45
<PAGE>
     by Federal Deposit Insurance. The parties acknowledge and agree that Escrow
     Company shall have no obligation or liability with respect to insuring the
     Deposit or with respect to the solvency of the depository institution, or
     otherwise with respect to the appropriateness of the depository institution
     for purposes of the Deposit. Further, the parties understand that Escrow
     Company assumes no responsibility for, nor will the parties hold the same
     liable for, any loss occurring which arises from the fact that (x) the
     amount of the account or accounts contemplated hereby may cause the
     aggregate amount of any individual depositor's account or accounts to
     exceed $100,000, (y) that this excess amount is not insured by the Federal
     Deposit Insurance Corporation, or (z) that Federal Deposit Insurance is not
     available on certain types of bank instruments.

          (i) Escrow Company may pay the Deposit into a court of competent
     jurisdiction upon commencement by the Escrow Company of an interpleader
     action in such court. The reasonable out-of-pocket costs and attorneys'
     fees of the Escrow Company for such interpleader action shall be paid by
     the losing party in such interpleader action.

          (j) The rights and immunities of Escrow Company hereunder shall apply
     equally to its partners, of counsel, associates, employees, affiliates and
     agents.

          (k) All of Escrow Company's obligations under this Agreement shall
     automatically terminate upon disbursing the Deposit as set forth above.

as Exhibit A (as the same may be changed by Seller by notice to Purchaser, the
"Wire Instructions"). Purchaser acknowledges that the Deposit has been fully
earned by Seller and is completely non-refundable,
<PAGE>
but shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing. In addition, on or before
one Business Day after the execution by Seller of this Amendment, Purchaser
shall wire to Seller pursuant to the Wire Instructions an additional amount of
$300,000 (the "First Extension Fee"). On or before February 20, 2005, Purchaser
shall wire to Seller pursuant to the Wire Instructions a second additional
amount of $300,000 (the "Second Extension Fee"). The First Extension Fee and the
Second Extension Fee have been fully earned by Seller and are completely
non-refundable, but shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing. In the
event that Purchaser fails to wire to Seller the First Extension Fee or the
Second Extension Fee within the time frame set forth herein, Seller shall have
the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement and shall have a claim against
Purchaser for the amount of the unfunded First Extension Fee and Second
Extension Fee.

     5. Corus Extension Fee.  Purchaser acknowledges that in order to extend the
maturity date of the existing mortgage loan encumbering the property, Seller is
required to pay its lender an extension fee of $250,000 on or before February
12, 2005 (as the same may be reduced or eliminated by Seller's lender in its
sole discretion, the "Corus Extension Fee"). Seller shall request that the
lender eliminate and/or reduce the Corus Extension Fee but can give Purchaser no
assurances that such fee will be reduced or eliminated. On or before February
10, 2005, Purchaser shall wire to Seller an amount equal to the Corus Extension
Fee.

     6. MRG Personal Property.  Pursuant to the First Amendment to Hotel
Purchase and Sale Agreement, Purchaser agreed that Seller has no obligation to
remove the MRG Personal Property on or before the Closing Date unless Purchaser
gave Seller notice on or before January 31, 2005. Purchaser acknowledges that
Purchaser did not deliver such notice and waives any claim it may have against
Seller as a result of Seller failing to remove the MRG Personal Property on or
before the Closing Date.

     7. Remedies.  Notwithstanding anything contrary contained in the Purchase
Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that its sole remedy in the event Seller fails
to perform its obligations under, or otherwise breaches, the Agreement shall be
to obtain a court order for specific performance compelling Seller to convey the
Property to Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement .
Except for Purchaser's right to initiate such process to obtain a court order
for a specific performance, Purchaser, on behalf of itself, its agents and
successors and assigns, covenants not to sue Seller with respect to any matter
relating to the Property, the Purchase Agreement or the transaction described
therein and releases Seller and its members, officers, directors and agents from
any liability with respect thereto.

     8. Miscellaneous.  A telecopied facsimile of a duly executed counterpart of
this Amendment shall be sufficient to evidence the binding agreement of each
party to the terms hereof. Except as amended hereby, all terms and conditions of
the Purchase Agreement are, and remain in full force and effect. In the event of
a conflict between the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the terms of this
Amendment, the terms of this Amendment shall control.

the purposes of amending certain terms and provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

         NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Seller and Purchaser agree as
follows:

         1.       Defined Terms. All capitalized terms used herein and not

         2.       Closing Date. The Closing Date is hereby extended to noon

         3.       Purchase Price. The Purchase Price is hereby increased by Five

to cause its management agent not to, attempt to negotiate any provisions of the

<PAGE>
Agreements hereafter up to and through the date of closing and to execute or
cause such management agent to execute the assignment attached as Exhibit B.

         6.       Remedies.


                  (a)      Notwithstanding anything contrary contained in the
         Purchase Agreement, Purchaser hereby waives any and all claims against
         Seller under the Purchase Agreement and acknowledges that its sole
         remedy in the event Seller fails to perform its obligations under, or
         otherwise breaches, the Agreement shall be to obtain a court order for
         specific performance compelling Seller to convey the Property to
         Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement .
         Except for Purchaser's right to initiate such process to obtain a court
         order for a specific performance, Purchaser, on behalf of itself, its
         agents and successors and assigns, covenants not to sue Seller with
         respect to any matter relating to the Property, the Purchase Agreement
         or the transaction described therein and releases Seller and its
         members, officers, directors and agents from any liability with respect
         thereto.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
         the Purchase Agreement, in addition to all remedies which Seller may
         have against Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Purchaser
         agrees that in the event that Purchaser fails to perform its obligation
         to close the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement on the
         Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay Seller additional liquidated damages
         in the amount of $3,000,000. Seller and Purchaser agree that the
         Seller's damages resulting from Purchaser's default are difficult to
         determine, and the amount of the additional liquidated damages, in
         addition to Seller's remedies pursuant to Section 13.01 of the Purchase
         Agreement, is a fair estimate of those damages. Robert Falor and Guy
         Mitchell (collectively "Guarantor") jointly and severally agree to
         guarantee the obligation of the Purchaser to pay the liquidated damages
         set forth in this Section 6(b). Such guarantee is unconditional and
         Robert Falor and Guy Mitchell waive any and all defenses to such claim
         and acknowledge that Seller shall have no obligation to pursue action
         against any other party, including Purchaser, prior to enforcing its
         rights against Guarantor. Guarantor agrees that their obligation under
         this Section 6(b) shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
         Massachusetts and any litigation in connection therewith shall be
         conducted in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and each of Robert Falor
         and Guy Mitchell submit to jurisdiction and consent to venue in such
         courts and waive any defense based on forum non conveniens.

         7.       Acceleration of Closing Date: Release of Guaranty.

                  (a)      Purchaser shall have the right to accelerate the
         Closing Date to Friday, March 18, 2005 by providing Seller with written
         notice thereof on or before 12:00 noon eastern standard time on
         Tuesday, March 15. Such acceleration shall only be effective in the
         event that Purchaser wires to Seller an additional $1,000,000 pursuant
         to the Wiring Instructions on or before 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time
         on Tuesday, March 15, 2005. Upon receipt, such $1,000,000 will have
         been fully earned by Seller and is completely non-refundable, but shall
         be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing. In the event that
         Purchaser validly exercise its right to accelerate the Closing Date and
         delivers the $1,000,000 in accordance with the provisions set forth in
         this Paragraph 7, (i) the provisions of Section 6(b) of this Amendment
         shall be of no further force and effect (e.g. Seller shall not be
         entitled to the additional $3,000,000 as liquidated damages in the
         event Purchaser defaults and Robert Falor and Guy Mitchell shall be
         released from any liability with respect to the guaranty and (ii) the
         Purchase Price shall be reduced by $200,000.00.

                  (b)      In the event that Purchaser wires to Seller an
         additional $1,000,000 pursuant to the Wiring Instructions on or before
         5:00 p.m. eastern standard time on Tuesday, March 15, 2005, but does
         not accelerate the Closing Date as provided in subsection (a) above,
         the provisions of Section 6(b) of this Amendment shall be of no further
         force and effect (e.g. Seller shall not be entitled to the additional
         $3,000,000 as liquidated damages in the event Purchaser defaults and
         Robert Falor and Guy Mitchell shall be released from any liability with
         respect to the guaranty). There shall be no reduction in the Purchase
         Price if the Closing Date is not accelerated. Upon receipt, such
         $1,000,000 will have been fully earned by Seller and is completely
         non-refundable, but shall be applied to the Purchase Price at Closing.
