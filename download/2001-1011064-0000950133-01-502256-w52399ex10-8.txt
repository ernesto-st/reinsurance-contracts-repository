                                    BORROWING

         Section 2.1 The Loan.

                           (a) The Lender agrees to lend to the Borrowers
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the Borrowers,
jointly and severally, agree to borrow on a revolving basis from the Lender from
time to time the principal amount (the "Loan") not to exceed at any time
outstanding the lesser of (i) the Credit Facility Committed Amount, or (ii) the
Borrowing Base.

                           (b) The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loan
shall be evidenced by the Revolving Credit Note of even date herewith (as
further amended, restated, substituted, extended, renewed and otherwise modified
from time to time, the "Note") payable to the Lender in the form attached hereto
as EXHIBIT A. The Note shall bear interest and shall be repaid by the Borrowers
in the manner and at the times set forth in the Note.

                           (c) The conditions precedent for making an advance
under the Loan shall be as set forth in this Agreement. Sums borrowed and repaid
may be readvanced under the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Advances
shall be made by the Lender on a pro rata basis based on their pro rata shares
of the Credit Facility Committed Amount.

                           (d) The Borrowers will prepare a Borrowing Base
Report (each a "Borrowing Base Report") attached hereto as EXHIBIT B which must
also be certified by the Borrowers listing for each of the Facilities (i) the
applicable Appraised Value (ii) Total Development Cost, and (iii) its status as
of the most recent reporting date as a Pool A, Pool B, Pool C or Pool D Project.
The initial Borrowing Base Report is attached hereto as EXHIBIT C. The Borrower
shall submit updated Borrowing Base Reports in connection with each request for
an advance or a certification of no deterioration in the pool status of any
Facility since the last Borrowing Base Report and will also submit current a
current Borrowing Base Report within forty-five (45) days after the end of each
of the Borrowers' fiscal quarters. The Borrowing Base Report will be based on
appraisals obtained by the Lender and other information on the Facilities
provided by the Borrowers or obtained by the Lender. The Borrowing Base shall be
computed based on the Borrowing Base Report most recently prepared by the
Borrowers and reviewed and accepted by the Lender. In the event the Borrowers
shall fail to furnish other current reports or information as reasonably
required by the Lender pursuant to the Financing Documents, or in the event the
Lender believes that a Borrowing Base Report is no longer accurate, the Lender
may, in its reasonable discretion exercised from time to time and without
limiting its other rights and remedies under the Financing Documents, upon
notice to the Borrowers and the expiration of a cure period of five (5) Banking
Days, designate any Facility as a Pool D Project or suspend the making of or
limit advances under the Loan. The Borrowing Base shall be subject to reduction
as a result of the following events: (i) the release of a Facility from the lien
of the applicable Deed of Trust, (ii) by the change of any Facility's status as
a Pool A or B Project to a Pool B or C Project or a Pool A, B or C Project to a
Pool D Project respectively as determined by the Lender. The Borrowing Base
shall be subject to increase as a result of the change of a Facility's status as
a Pool B, C or D Project to a Pool A as determined by the Lender.


                                       15
<PAGE>   21
                           (e) The Borrowers shall furnish to the Lender such
schedules, certificates, lists, records, reports, information and documents as
required by the Lender from time to time so that the Lender may, in its
reasonable discretion, determine the Borrowing Base.

                           (f) If at any time the aggregate principal amount of
the Loan outstanding exceeds the Borrowing Base, a borrowing base deficiency
("Borrowing Base Deficiency") shall exist. Each time a Borrowing Base Deficiency
exists, the Borrowers shall within three (3) Banking Days of notice thereof from
the Lender either pay the amount and/or add Facilities to increase the Borrowing
Base to an amount which is at least equal to the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the Loan.

                           (g) The current Borrowing Base Report is attached
hereto as EXHIBIT C.

                           (h) As of the date hereof the Borrowers have
designated and the Lender has accepted each of the Facilities owned by the
Borrowers into the Borrowing Base as Facilities.


         Section 2.2 Procedure for Advances.

                           (a) The Lender will make advances from time to time
upon receipt of written request from the Borrowers in the form designated by the
Lender, provided that after giving effect to the Borrowers' request, the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan would not exceed the lesser of the
Credit Facility Committed Amount or the Borrowing Base. Each advance under the
Loan shall be in an amount of not less than $1,000,000, and in increments of
$250,000 in excess thereof. Advances or the renewal of a Eurodollar Period shall
be requested by the Borrowers orally or in writing by 10:00 A.M. (Eastern time)
three (3) Banking Days prior to the Banking Day on which the funds will be
advanced. The Borrowers shall advise the Lender at the time of such notice which
Eurodollar Period they are selecting. The Lender shall have no obligation to
make any advance if at the time such advance is requested and/or is proposed to
be funded, there exists an Event of Default or an event which upon notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute an Event of Default under the Financing
Documents. If the Borrowers fail to advise the Lender three (3) Banking Days in
advance of the expiration of a Eurodollar Period of their intention to either
pay off such portion of the Loan or renew the applicable Eurodollar Period, it
shall be assumed by the Lender that the Eurodollar Period is to be renewed.

                           (b) In addition, if the Lender has reason to believe
a Default or an Event of Default has occurred, the Borrowers hereby irrevocably
authorize the Lender to make advances of the Loan at any time and from time to
time, without further request from or notice to the Borrowers, which the Lender,
in its sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary or appropriate to protect
the Lender's interests under this Agreement or otherwise, including, without
limitation, advances of the Loan made to cover interest on the Loan, fees,
and/or Enforcement Costs, prior to, on, or after the termination of this
Agreement, regardless of whether the aggregate amount of the advances of the
Loan which the Lender may make hereunder exceeds the Credit Facility Committed
Amount. The Lender shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any advance under
this subsection and the making of one or more advances under this subsection
shall not obligate the Lender to make other similar advances. Any such advances
will be evidenced by the Note secured by the Collateral and the Deeds of Trust.

         Section 2.3 Fees.

                  2.3.1 Commitment Fee.

                  On or before the date of the Credit Facility Closing, the
Borrowers shall pay to the Lender a commitment fee of $90,000 (the "Commitment
Fee"). The Borrowers shall pay to the Lender an additional extension fee of
$90,000 on the earlier of (a) the original maturity date of the note if the note
is extended pursuant to its term or (b) if the currently proposed restructure of
the Master Credit Facility is not fully subscribed by a syndicate of lenders in
the aggregate principal sum of $350,000,000 by May 30, 2001 and closed by June
30, 2001 (then such additional fee shall be payable on July 2, 2001).

                  2.3.2 Unused Line Fee

                           (a) The Borrowers shall pay to the Lender on the
first day of each fiscal quarter and on the Revolving Credit Termination Date a
quarterly revolving credit facility fee (the "Unused Line Fee") in an amount
equal to twenty-five (25) basis points per annum of the average daily unused and
undisbursed portion of the Loan.

         Section 2.4 Interest Rate Matters.

                  2.4.1 Inability to Determine Eurodollar Rate.

                  In the event that the Lender determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances
affecting the London interbank market, quotation of Eurodollar Rates for any
portion of the Note are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
relevant maturities for the purpose of determining a Eurodollar Rate for any
portion of the principal sum, the Lender will give notice of such determination
to the Borrowers at least one (1) day prior to the date of an advance or any
subsequent Eurodollar Period for the Loan. If any such notice is given, the
Lender shall have no obligation to make any advance or maintain any principal
sum outstanding at a Eurodollar Rate. Until the earlier of the date any such
notice has been withdrawn by the Lender or the date when the Lender and the
Borrowers have mutually agreed upon an alternate method of determining the rates
of interest payable on the Loan, as the case may be, the Borrowers shall not
have the right to have additional advances or maintain any portion of the Credit
Facility at a Eurodollar Rate, whereupon the Lender and the Borrowers shall
mutually agree upon an alternate method of determining the rates of interest
payable on the Loan or the principal outstanding under the Note shall be
immediately due and payable.

                  2.4.2 Illegality.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Financing Documents
to the contrary, in the event that it shall become unlawful for the Lender to
obtain funds in the London interbank market or for the Lender to maintain the
Loan at the Eurodollar Rate, then, by written notice to the Borrowers, the
Lender may declare that advances will not thereafter be made or the Loan
maintained by the Lender hereunder at the Eurodollar Rate, whereupon the Lender
and the Borrowers shall mutually agree upon an alternate method of determining
the rates of interest payable on the Loan or the principal outstanding under the
Note shall be immediately due and payable.

                  2.4.3 Increased Costs and Reduced Return.

                           (a) If any event shall occur (whether in the form of
a reserve requirement (not included in the definition of the Eurodollar Rate),
exchange control regulations, governmental charges, compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority,
changes in the London interbank market or the position of the Lender in such
market or otherwise) and the result of any such event is, in the Lender's
reasonable judgment, to increase the costs which the Lender determines are
attributable to its making or maintaining the Loan at the Eurodollar Rate in
excess of those costs already in effect as of April 1, 2001, or its obligation
to make available the Loan at the Eurodollar Rate or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable by the Lender under the Note, then, within ten (10)
days after demand by the Lender, Borrowers hereby agree to pay to the Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender for such
increased cost or reduction.

                           (b) In addition to any amounts payable pursuant to
subsection (a), if the Lender shall have determined that the applicability of
any law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted pursuant to or arising out of the
July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory
Practices entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards," or the adoption after the date hereof of any other law, rule,
regulation or guideline regarding capital adequacy, or any change in any of the
foregoing or in the enforcement or interpretation or administration of any of
the foregoing by any court or any central bank or other Governmental Authority,
charged with the enforcement or interpretation or administration thereof, or
compliance by the Lender (or any lending office of the Lender) or the Lender's
holding company with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on the Lender's capital or on the capital of the Lender's holding company, if
any, as a consequence of its making or maintaining the Loan or its incurring any
obligations under this Agreement to a level below that which the Lender or the
Lender's holding company could have achieved but for such applicability,
adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration the Lender's policies
and the policies of the Lender's holding company with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by the Lender to be material, then, upon demand by
the Lender, the Borrowers hereby agree to pay to the Lender from time to time
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate the Lender or the Lender's
holding company for any such reduction suffered.

                  2.4.4 Notice of Amounts Payable to Lender.

                  If the Lender shall seek payment of any amounts from Borrowers
pursuant to this Section or under Section 2.4 (Interest Rate Matters), it shall
notify the Borrowers of the amount payable by the Borrowers to the Lender
hereunder. A certificate of the Lender seeking payment setting forth in
reasonable detail the factual basis for and the computation of the amount
specified, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties for all purposes,
absent manifest error, as to the amounts owned. The Borrowers' obligations under
this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment
of the Obligations.

         Section 2.5 Extensions.

         At any time not later than thirty (30) days prior to the Revolving
Credit Expiration Date, the Borrowers may request that the Lender, in its sole
discretion, extend the Revolving Credit


                                       18
<PAGE>   24
Expiration Date for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days; provided,
however, that the Borrowers will be required to repay the Loan in full
simultaneously with the closing of the restructuring of the Master Credit
Facility.

         Section 2.6 Permitted Costs.

         Advances under the Borrowing Base shall be made available by the Lender
pursuant to a Borrowing Base Report issued quarterly by the Lender or more
frequently in the Lender's discretion and certified by the Borrowers in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Total Development Costs may include
the following cost which have actually been paid by the Borrowers or on their
behalf by their Affiliates (i) the acquisition by the Borrowers of the Land
which is the site of such Facility, (ii) the construction on the Premises of a
Facility containing residential units and common facilities (iii) marketing,
staffing and similar pre-opening expenses and (iv) an Operating Reserve. Unless
otherwise agreed to by the Lender and to the extent specifically permitted by
the Lender, the process of verification of Requisitions shall have confirmed the
payment by any of the Borrowers of the following costs and expenses related to
the development of the Premises and the construction of the Improvements and no
others may be included in a Total Development Cost: (i) the payment of interest
when due without further authorization or consent of the Borrowers; (ii) the

architects and accountants, insurance and bond premiums, ad valorem real estate
taxes and other costs directly related to the development of the Land and the
construction, marketing, initial start-up operating of the Improvements and (v)
for other pre-opening fees.

         Section 2.7 Co-Borrower Obligations.

         Each Person included in the term "Borrowers", including each Additional
Borrower, hereby covenants and agrees with the Lender as follows:

                           (a) The Obligations include all present and future
indebtedness, duties, obligations, and liabilities, whether now existing or
contemplated or hereafter arising, of any one or more of the Borrowers in
connection with the Loan.

                           (b) Reference in this Agreement and the other
Financing Documents to the "Borrowers" or otherwise with respect to any one or
more of the Persons now or hereafter included in the definition of "Borrowers"
shall mean each and every such Person and any one or more of such Persons,
jointly and severally, unless the context requires otherwise.

                           (c) For administrative convenience, each Person
included in the term "Borrowers" hereby irrevocably appoints the Primary
Borrower as the Borrowers' attorney-in-fact, with power of substitution (with
the prior written consent of the Lender in the exercise of its sole and absolute
discretion), in the name of the Primary Borrower or in the name of any of the
Borrowers or otherwise to take any and all actions with respect to this
Agreement, the other Financing Documents, the Obligations and/or the Collateral
(including, without


                                       19
<PAGE>   25
limitation, the Proceeds thereof) as the Primary Borrower may so elect from time
to time, including, without limitation, actions to (i) request advances under
the Loan, and direct the Lender to disburse or credit the proceeds of any
advance under the Loan directly to an account of any Borrower, or otherwise,
which direction shall evidence the making of such advance and shall constitute
the acknowledgment by each Borrower of the receipt of the proceeds of the Loan,
(ii) enter into, execute, deliver, amend, modify, restate, substitute, extend
and/or renew this Agreement, any other Financing Documents, security agreements,
mortgages, deposit account agreements, instruments, certificates, waivers,
letter of credit applications, releases, documents and agreements from time to
time, and (iii) endorse any check or other item of payment in the name of such
Person or in the name of the Primary Borrower. The foregoing appointment is
coupled with an interest, cannot be revoked without the prior written consent of
the Lender, and may be exercised from time to time through the Primary
Borrower's duly authorized officer, officers or other Person or Persons
designated by the Primary Borrower to act from time to time on behalf of the
Primary Borrower.

                           (d) Each Borrowers hereby irrevocably authorizes the
Lender to make advances to any one or more of the Borrowers pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement upon the written, oral or telephonic request any
one or more of the Persons who is from time to time a Responsible Officer of the
Primary Borrower under the provisions of the most recent certificate of
corporate resolutions and/or incumbency of the Primary Borrower on file with the
Lender and also upon the written, oral or telephone request of any one of the
Responsible Officers of any Borrower.

                           (e) The Lender assumes no responsibility or liability
for any errors, mistakes, and/or discrepancies in the oral, telephonic, written
or other transmissions of any instructions, orders, requests and confirmations
between the Lender and any one or more of the Persons included in the term
"Borrowers", any advance under the Loan or any other transaction in connection
with the provisions of this Agreement except those resulting from the Lender's
gross negligence or willful misconduct.

         Section 2.8 Agreement Among Borrowers.

         Without implying any limitation on the joint and several nature of the
Obligations, the Lender agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Persons included in the term "Borrowers" may create reasonable
inter-company indebtedness between or among the Persons included in the term
"Borrowers" with respect to the allocation of the benefits and proceeds of the
advances under this Agreement. The Persons included in the term "Borrowers"
agree among themselves, and the Lender consents to that agreement, that each
such Person shall have rights of contribution from all such Persons to the
extent such Person incurs Obligations in excess of the proceeds of the Loan
received by, or allocated to purposes for the direct benefit of, such Person.
All such indebtedness and rights shall be, and are hereby agreed by the Persons
included in the term "Borrowers" to be, subordinate in priority and payment to
the indefeasible repayment in full in cash of the Obligations, and, unless the
Lender agrees in writing otherwise, shall not be exercised or repaid in whole or
in part until all of the Obligations have been indefeasibly paid in full in
cash. Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" agrees that all of such
inter-company indebtedness and rights of contribution are part of the Collateral
and secure the Obligations. Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby
waives all rights of


                                       20
<PAGE>   26
counterclaim, recoupment and offset between or among themselves arising on
account of that indebtedness and otherwise. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by the Lender, no Person included in the term "Borrowers" shall evidence
the inter-company indebtedness or rights of contribution by note or other
instrument, and shall not secure such indebtedness or rights of contribution
with any Lien or security.

         Section 2.9 Benefits to Borrowers.

         Each Person included in the term "Borrowers" hereby represents and
warrants to the Lender that each of them will derive benefits, directly and
indirectly, from each advance under the Loan, both in their separate capacity
and as a member of the integrated group to which each such Person belongs and
because the successful operation of the integrated group is dependent upon the
continued successful performance of the functions of the integrated group as a
whole, because (a) the terms of the consolidated financing provided under this
Agreement are more favorable than would otherwise be obtainable by such Persons
individually, and (b) the additional administrative and other costs and reduced
flexibility associated with individual financing arrangements which would
otherwise be required if obtainable would substantially reduce the value to such
Persons of the financing.

         Section 2.10 Guaranty.

modify, limit, lessen, reduce, impair, discharge, or otherwise affect the
liability of each Borrower under this Section 2.10 in any manner whatsoever, and

of any one or more of the Persons included in the term "Borrowers", any other
guarantor or any obligor under any of the Financing Documents, that may result
from any such proceedings.

Lender and such other persons as the Lender may direct with a written
certificate, duly acknowledged stating in detail whether or not any credits,

compensate the Lender for any and all losses or expenses which the Lender may
sustain or incur (including without limitation, any such loss or expense arising
from the redeployment of funds obtained by the Lender). Unless an Event of
Default has occurred, any partial prepayment shall be applied first to such
breakage costs, second to accrued and unpaid interest and third to the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan due and owing at maturity. Sums
borrowed and repaid may be readvanced. The Borrowers' obligations under this
Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment of the
Obligations.

         Section 4.8 Assignments.

         The Borrowers agree not to transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate any
right or interest in any payment or advance due pursuant to this Agreement, or
any of the other benefits of this Agreement, without the prior written consent
of the Lender. Any assignment made or attempted by the Borrowers, or any of
them, without the prior written consent of the Lender shall be void and of no
effect. No consent by the Lender to an assignment by the Borrowers shall release
the

<PAGE>   35
Borrowers as the parties primarily obligated and liable under the terms of this
Agreement unless the Borrowers shall be released specifically by the Lender in
writing. No consent by the Lender to an assignment shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the requirement of prior written consent by the Lender with respect to
each and every further assignment and as a condition precedent to the
effectiveness of such assignment.

         Section 4.9 Liability of the Lender.

         The Lender shall in no event be responsible or liable to any person
other than the Borrowers for the disbursement of or failure to disburse the Loan

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         To induce the Lender to make available the Credit Facility, the
Borrowers represent and warrant to the Lender that:

         Section 5.1 Existence/Good Standing.

         Each Borrower is a limited partnership or a limited liability company
duly organized and existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its formation, has the power to own its property and to carry on
its business as now being conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which each Facility owned by such
Borrower is located and in which the character of the properties owned by it
therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification
necessary.

         Section 5.2 Power and Authority.

         Each Borrower has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each of the other Financing Documents executed and delivered by
it, to make the borrowing hereunder, and to incur the Obligations, all of which
have been duly authorized by all proper and necessary action. No consent or
approval of partners or members of, or lender to, the Borrowers, and no consent
or approval of any Governmental Authority or any third party payor on the part
of the Borrowers, is required as a condition to the validity or enforceability
of this Agreement or any of the other Financing Documents executed and delivered
by any of the Borrowers or to the payment or performance by the Borrowers of the
Obligations.

         Section 5.3 Binding Agreements.

         This Agreement and each of the other Financing Documents executed and
delivered by the Borrowers have been properly executed by the Borrowers,
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Borrowers and are fully
enforceable against the Borrowers in accordance with their respective terms.

         Section 5.4 Litigation.

         There are no proceedings pending before any court or arbitrator or
before or by any Governmental Authority which, in any one case or in the
aggregate, will cause a Material Adverse Change in any of the Borrowers or
affect the authority of any of the Borrowers to enter into this Agreement or any
of the other Financing Documents executed and delivered by any of


                                       30
<PAGE>   36
the Borrowers. There is no pending revocation, suspension, termination,
probation, restriction, limitation or non-renewal of any License, Participation
Agreement or any similar accreditation or approval organization or Governmental
Authority for healthcare providers, including, without limitation, the issuance
of any provisional License or other License with a term of less than twelve (12)
months, as a consequence of any sanctions imposed by any Governmental Authority,
nor is there any pending assessment of any civil or criminal penalties by any
Governmental Authority, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to any of
the Borrowers, could result in a Material Adverse Change in any of the
Borrowers. The Borrowers do not have any appeals regarding rates or
reimbursements currently pending or contemplated before any Governmental
Authority or any administrator of any third party payor or preferred provider
program or referral source, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to any
of the Borrowers, could result in a Material Adverse Change in any of the
Borrowers. There are no Medicare or Medicaid recoupments or recoupments of any
other third party payor being sought, requested or claimed, against any of the
Borrowers, the outcome of which, if determined adversely to any of the Borrowers
could materially impair any of the Borrowers' ability to pay the Obligations,
except as otherwise disclosed in writing to, and approved by, the Lender.

         Section 5.5 No Conflicting Agreements.

         There is (a) no provision of any Borrower's organizational or governing
documents and no provision of any existing mortgage, indenture, contract or
agreement binding on any of the Borrower or affecting its property, and (b) to
the knowledge of the Borrowers no provision of law or order of court binding
upon any of the Borrowers, which would conflict with or in any way prevent the
execution, delivery, or performance of the terms of this Agreement or of any of
the other Financing Documents executed and delivered by any of the Borrowers, or
which would be violated as a result of such execution, delivery or performance,
or, if so, all necessary consents have been obtained.

         Section 5.6 Financial Information.

         All financial statements or information hereto furnished to the Lender
with respect to the Borrowers, each Facility is complete and correct in all
material respects and fairly presents the financial condition of the Borrowers
and the financial condition of the Facilities and Guarantor. There are no
liabilities, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, of any of the Borrowers or
the Guarantor which are not reflected in the their respective financial
statements or in the notes thereto. There has been no Material Adverse Change in
the financial condition or operations of any of the Borrowers or the Guarantor
since the financial statements dated December 31, 2000 (and to the Borrowers'
knowledge no such Material Adverse Change is pending), and neither any of the
Borrowers nor the Guarantor has guaranteed the obligations of, or made any
investments in or advances to, any company, individual or other entity, except
as disclosed in such information.

         Section 5.7 No Default.

         None of the Borrowers are in default under or with respect to any
obligation under any agreement to which such Borrower is a party in any respect
which could result in a Material Adverse Change. There is no Event of Default
hereunder.

Borrowers and adequate reserves therefor have been established as required under
GAAP.

of Regulation U (12 CFR ARTICLE 221), of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (herein called "margin security" and "margin stock") or for any

Agreement to violate any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or the Small
Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, or any rules or regulations
promulgated under any of such statutes.

ERISA, which plan is now or previously has been maintained or contributed to by

multi-employer plan will be placed in "reorganization".

         Section 5.13 Governmental Consent.

         Neither the nature of any of the Borrowers or of any of their
businesses or properties, nor any relationship between any of the Borrowers and
any other Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the making of the
Loan, or the offer, issue, sale or delivery of the Note is such as to require a
consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, registration or qualification
with, any Governmental Authority, on the part of any of the Borrowers, as a
condition to the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any of the other
Financing Documents, the borrowing of the principal amounts of the Loan or the

Lender in connection with the making available of the Credit Facility, contain

         Section 5.26 Defaults.

         The Borrowers represent and warrant that there is no default on the
part of any of the Borrowers under the Financing Documents and no event has

all or any part of the Collateral;

                           (g) remove from any of the Borrowers' places of
business all books, records, ledger sheets, correspondence, invoices and

be reasonably necessary to administer, control and collect the Collateral;

proceedings to enforce collection of, or realize upon, any of the Collateral;

                           (j) settle, renew, extend, compromise, compound,
exchange or adjust claims in respect of any of the Collateral or any legal

                           (k) endorse the name of any of the Borrowers upon any

<PAGE>   63
                           (l) notify the Post Office authorities to change the
address for the delivery of mail to the Borrowers to such address or Post Office
Box as the Lender may designate and receive and open all mail addressed to the
Borrowers.

         In addition, the Borrowers shall, following an Event of Default
promptly, upon request, execute and deliver to the Lender written assignments,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, in form and content acceptable to the
Lender, of specific Accounts or groups of Accounts; provided, however, that the
lien and/or security interest granted to the Lender under this Agreement shall
not be limited in any way to or by the inclusion or exclusion of Accounts within
such assignments. Such Accounts shall secure payment of the Obligations and are
not sold to the Lender whether or not any assignment thereof, which is separate
from this Agreement, is in form absolute.


         Following an Event of Default, the Lender may also direct the Borrowers
to appoint a manager for any or all of the Facilities and enter into a
management agreement with one or more management companies approved by the
Lender, the terms of which agreement shall be approved by the Lender.

         Section 10.4 Performance by Lender.

         Following an Event of Default, the Lender without the necessity of
prior notice to or demand upon the Borrowers and without waiving or releasing
any of the Obligations or any Event of Default, may (but shall be under no
obligation to) at any time thereafter make such payment or perform such act for
the account and at the expense of the Borrowers, and may enter upon the premises
of the Borrower for that purpose and take all such action thereon as the Lender
may consider necessary or appropriate for such purpose. The Lender will give the
Borrowers notice, at least subsequently, of any such performance by the Lender.
All sums so paid or advanced by the Lender and all costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses)
incurred in connection therewith (the "Expense Payments") together with interest
thereon from the date of payment, advance or incurring until paid in full at the
Post-Default Rate shall be paid by the Borrowers to the Lender on demand and
shall constitute and become a part of the Obligations.

         Section 10.5 Uniform Commercial Code and Other Remedies.

         Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (and in addition to all of
its rights, powers and remedies under this Agreement), the Lender shall have all
of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the applicable Uniform
Commercial Code and other applicable laws, and the Lender is authorized to
offset and apply to all or any part of the Obligations all moneys, credits and
other property of any nature whatsoever of the Borrowers now or at any time
hereafter in the possession of, in transit to or from, under the control or
custody of, or on deposit with, the Lender; and upon demand by the Lender, the
Borrowers shall assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Lender, at
a place designated by the Lender or its agents may enter upon the Borrowers'
premises to take possession of the Collateral, to remove it, to render it
unusable, or to sell or otherwise dispose of it.

         Any written notice of the sale, disposition or other intended action by
the Lender with respect to the Collateral which is sent by regular mail, postage
prepaid, to the Borrowers at the


                                       58
<PAGE>   64
address set forth in ARTICLE IX (Events of Default), or such other address of
the Borrowers which may from time to time be shown on the Lender's records, at
least ten (10) days prior to such sale, disposition or other action, shall
constitute reasonable notice to the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall pay on demand
all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorney's fees and
expenses, incurred by or on behalf of the Lender in preparing for sale or other
disposition, selling, managing, collecting or otherwise disposing of, the
Collateral. All of such costs and expenses (the "Liquidation Costs") together
with interest thereon from the date incurred until paid in full at the
Post-Default Rate, shall be paid by the Borrowers to the Lender on demand and
shall constitute and become a part of the Obligations. Any proceeds of sale or
other disposition of the Collateral will be applied by the Lender to the payment
of the Liquidation Costs and Expense Payments, and any balance of such proceeds
will be applied by the Lender to the payment of the balance of the Obligations
in such order and manner of application as the Lender may from time to time in
its sole discretion determine. After such application of the proceeds, any
balance shall be paid to the applicable Borrowers or to any other party entitled
thereto.

         Section 10.6 Receiver or Other Court Order.

         Following an Event of Default, as a matter of right, following ten (10)
days notice and without regard to the adequacy of the security, and upon
application to a court of competent jurisdiction, the Lender shall be entitled
to the immediate appointment of a receiver for all or any part of the
Collateral, and of the payments and proceeds thereof and therefrom, whether such
receivership be incidental to a proposed sale of the Collateral or otherwise,
and the Borrowers hereby consent to the appointment of such a receiver and to an
order of court directing that payments, including Medicare and Medicaid
payments, be made directly to the receiver. The Borrowers will pay to the
Beneficiary, upon demand, all expenses, including receiver's fees, attorney's
fees, costs and agents compensation, advanced by the Borrowers and incurred
pursuant to the provisions contained in this Section.

         Section 10.7 No Conditions Precedent to Exercise of Remedies.

         The Borrowers shall not be relieved of any obligation by reason of the
failure of the Lender to comply with any request of the Borrowers or of any
other person to take action to foreclose on the Property under the Deed of Trust
or otherwise to enforce any provision of the Financing Documents, or by reason
of the release, regardless of consideration, of all or any part of the Property,
or by reason of any agreement or stipulation between any subsequent owner of the
Property and the Lender extending the time of payment or modifying the terms of
the Financing Documents without first having obtained the consent of the
Borrowers; and in the latter event, the Borrowers shall continue to be liable to
make payments according to the terms of any such extension or modification
agreement, unless expressly released and discharged in writing by the Lender.

         Section 10.8 Remedies Cumulative and Concurrent.

         No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Lender or the Lender
is intended to be exclusive of any other remedies provided for in the Financing
Documents, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative, and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given hereunder, or under the Financing
Documents, or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Every
right, power and remedy given by the Financing Documents to the Lender shall be


                                       59
<PAGE>   65
concurrent and may be pursued separately, successively or together against any
or all of the Borrowers or the Property or any part thereof, and every right,
power and remedy given by the Financing Documents may be exercised from time to
time as often as may be deemed expedient by the Lender.

         Section 10.9 Strict Performance.

         No delay or omission of the Lender to exercise any right, power or
remedy accruing upon the happening of an Event of Default shall impair any such
right, power or remedy or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of
Default or any acquiescence therein. No delay or omission on the part of the
Lender to exercise any option for acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations, or any of them, or for foreclosure of the Deeds of Trust, or any of
them, following any Event of Default as aforesaid, or any other option granted
to the Lender hereunder in any one or more instances, or the acceptance by the
Lender of any partial payment on account of the Obligations shall constitute a
waiver of any such Event of Default and each such option shall remain
continuously in full force and effect.

         Section 11.2 Consents and Approvals.

         If any consent, approval, or authorization of any Governmental
Authority or of any Person having any interest therein, should be necessary to
effectuate any sale or other disposition of the Collateral, the Borrowers agree
to execute all such applications and other instruments, and to take all other
action, as may be required in connection with securing any such consent,
approval or authorization.

         Section 11.3 Remedies, etc. Cumulative.

         Each right, power and remedy of the Lender as provided for in this
Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise shall be cumulative and
concurrent and shall be in addition to every other right, power or remedy
provided for in this Agreement or in any of the other Financing Documents or now
or hereafter existing at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise, and the
exercise or beginning of the exercise by the Lender of any one or more of such
rights, powers or remedies shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise
by the Lender of any or all such other rights, powers or remedies. In order to
entitle the Lender to exercise any remedy reserved to it herein, it shall not be
necessary to give any notice, other than such notice as may be expressly
required in this Agreement.

         Section 11.4 No Waiver of Rights by the Lender.

         No failure or delay by the Lender to insist upon the strict performance
of any term, condition, covenant or agreement of this Agreement or of any of the
other Financing Documents, or to exercise any right, power or remedy consequent
upon a breach thereof, shall constitute a waiver of any such term, condition,
covenant or agreement or of any such breach or preclude the Lender from
exercising any such right, power or remedy at any later time or times. By
accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under this Agreement
or under any of the other Financing Documents, the Lender shall not be deemed to
waive the right either to require prompt payment when due of all other amounts
payable under this Agreement or under any of the other Financing Documents, or
to declare a default for failure to effect such prompt payment of any such other
amount.

         Section 11.5 Entire Agreement.

         The Financing Documents shall completely and fully supersede all other
agreements, both written and oral, between the Lender and any of the Borrowers
relating to the Obligations. Neither the Lender nor the Borrowers shall
hereafter have any rights under such prior agreements but shall look solely to
the Financing Documents for definition and determination of all of their
respective rights, liabilities and responsibilities relating to the Obligations.

         Section 11.6 Survival of Agreement; Successors and Assigns.

         All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the
Borrowers herein and in any certificate, in the Financing Documents and in any
other instruments or documents delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the
making by the Lender of the Loan and the execution and delivery of the Note, and
shall continue in full force and effect so long as any of the Obligations are
outstanding and unpaid. Whenever in this Agreement any of the parties hereto is
referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include the successors and
assigns of such party; and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on
behalf of the Borrowers which are contained in this Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the Lender, and all
covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Lender which are
contained in this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the permitted
successors and permitted assigns of the Borrowers, but this Agreement may not be
assigned by the Borrowers without the prior written consent of the Lender.

         Section 11.7 Expenses.

         The Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the
Lender (excluding travel expenses but including the reasonable fees and expenses
of the legal counsel of the Lender) in connection with the preparation of this
Agreement, the issuance of the Loan hereunder, the recordation of all financing
statements and such other instruments as may be required by the Lender at the
time of, or subsequent to, the execution of this Agreement to secure the
Obligations (including any and all recordation tax and other costs and taxes
incident to recording), the administration of the Credit Facility (not otherwise
contemplated by any fee paid by the Borrowers), any future modification of the
Financing Documents, the addition of Facilities to the Borrowing Base or the
enforcement of any provision of this Agreement and the collection of the
Obligations. The Borrowers agree to indemnify and save harmless the Lender from
any liability resulting from the failure to pay any required recordation tax,
transfer taxes, recording costs or any other expenses incurred by the Lender in
connection with the Obligations. The provisions of this Section shall survive
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the repayment of the
Obligations. The Borrowers further agree to reimburse the Lender upon demand for
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
legal expenses and travel expenses) incurred by the Lender in enforcing any of
the Obligations or any security therefor or incurred in connection with any
bankruptcy proceeding or in any post-judgment enforcement or collection action,
together with interest at the Post-Default Rate which agreement shall survive
the termination of this Agreement and the repayment of the Obligations.

         Section 11.8 Counterparts.

         This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts all of
which together shall constitute a single instrument.

         Section 11.9 Governing Law.

         This Agreement and all of the other Financing Documents shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia; provided, however, any Deed of Trust and any financing statements
covering fixtures securing such Loan shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the state in which the applicable Facility is
located.

         Section 11.10 Modifications.

         No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or of any
of the other Financing Documents, nor consent to any departure by the Borrowers
therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the Lender, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. No notice to
or demand on the Borrowers in any case shall entitle the Borrowers to any other
or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstance.

         Section 11.11 Illegality.

         If fulfillment of any provision hereof or any transaction related
hereto or to any of the other Financing Documents, at the time performance of
such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity
prescribed by law, then ipso facto, the obligation to be fulfilled shall be
reduced to the limit of such validity; and if any clause or provisions herein
contained other than the provisions hereof pertaining to repayment of the
Obligations operates or would prospectively operate to invalidate this Agreement
in whole or in part, then such clause or provision only shall be void, as though
not herein contained, and the remainder of this Agreement shall remain operative
and in full force and effect; and if such provision pertains to repayment of the
Obligations, then, at the options of the Lender, all of the Obligations of the
Borrowers to the Lender shall become immediately due and payable.

         Section 11.12 Gender, etc.

         Whenever used herein, the singular number shall include the plural, the
plural the singular and the use of the masculine, feminine or neuter gender

         Section 11.13 Headings.

         The headings in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not
limit or otherwise affect any of the terms hereof.

         Section 11.14 Waiver of Trial by Jury.

         EACH OF THE BORROWERS AND THE LENDER HEREBY JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY WAIVE
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING TO WHICH ANY OF THEM MAY BE PARTIES,
NOT GOVERNED BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THE NOTE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY
WAY PERTAINING TO (A) THIS AGREEMENT, (B) ANY OF THE FINANCING DOCUMENTS, OR (C)
THE COLLATERAL. THIS WAIVER CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY OF ALL CLAIMS
AGAINST ALL PARTIES TO SUCH ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING CLAIMS AGAINST
PARTIES WHO ARE NOT PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT.

         This waiver is knowingly, willingly and voluntarily made by the
Borrowers and the Lender, and the Borrowers and the Lender hereby represent that
no representations of fact or opinion have been made by any individual to induce
this waiver of trial by jury or to in any way modify or nullify its effect. The
Borrowers and the Lender further represent that they have been represented in
the signing of this Agreement and in the making of this waiver by independent
legal counsel, selected of their own free will, and that they have had the
opportunity to discuss this waiver with counsel.

         Section 11.15 No Warranty by Lender.

         By accepting or approving anything required to be observed, performed
or fulfilled by the Borrowers or to be given to the Lender pursuant to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any certificate, balance sheet,
statement of profit and loss or other financial statement, Survey, receipt,
appraisal or insurance policy, the Lender shall not be deemed to have warranted
or represented the sufficiency, legality, effectiveness or legal effect of the
same, or of any term, provision or condition thereof and any such acceptance or
approval thereof shall not be or constitute any warranty or representation with
respect thereto by the Lender.

         Section 11.16 Liability of the Lender.

         The Lender shall not be liable for any other act or omission by the
Lender pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement in the absence of fraud or
gross negligence. The Lender shall incur no liability to the Borrowers or any
other party in connection with the acts or omissions of the Lender in reliance
upon any certificate or other paper believed by the Lender to be genuine or with
respect to any other thing which the Lender may do or refrain from doing, unless
such act or omission amounts to fraud or gross negligence. The Borrowers hereby
agree that the Lender shall not be chargeable for any negligence, mistake, act
or omission of any accountant, examiner, agency or attorney employed by the
Lender (except for the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any person,
corporation, partnership or other entity employed by the Lender) in making
examinations, investigations or collections, or otherwise in perfecting,
maintaining, protecting or realizing upon any lien or security interest or any
other interest in the Collateral or other security for the Obligations. The
Borrowers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold the Lender
and its successors and assigns harmless from and against any and all claims,
demands, suits, losses, damages, assessments, fines, penalties, costs or other
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs) arising from or
in connection with this Agreement. The provisions of this Section shall survive
the termination of the Credit Facility.

         Section 11.17 License of Tradename.

Care" or "Karrington" and any marks associated therewith in the operation of a
Facility upon the Lender's or trustee's taking of possession or taking over
management of a Facility or acquiring title thereto at a foreclosure sale which
license shall be in effect for a period of thirty (30) months from the date
thereof. The Borrowers further agree that a third-party purchaser of a Facility
may continue to operate the Facility under the name of any Borrower unless such
Borrower objects in writing thereto.

         Section 11.18 No Partnership.

         Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed in a manner to
create any relationship between the Borrowers and the Lender other than the
relationship of borrower and lender and the Borrowers and the Lender shall not

Agreement.

         Section 11.19 Third Parties; Benefit.

         All conditions to the obligation of the Lender to make advances
hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Lender and
its assigns and no other persons shall have standing to require satisfaction of

non-existence.
