the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the
right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an
office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States.
If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted
such appointment within 30&nbsp;days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the
retiring Agent may on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lender, appoint a successor Agent

Borrowers and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such

Documents (except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the
Lenders or the Issuing Bank under any of the Credit Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to
hold such collateral security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed) and (2)&nbsp;all
payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall
instead be made by or to each Lender and the Issuing Bank directly, until such time as the Required

successor&#146;s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with
all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Agent, and the
retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the
other Credit Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).
The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrowers and such successor. After the retiring
Agent&#146;s resignation hereunder and under the other Credit Documents, the provisions of this Article
and <U>Section&nbsp;14.8</U> shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent. Any resignation by Wachovia as
Agent pursuant to this Section shall also constitute its resignation as Issuing Bank. Upon the
acceptance of a successor&#146;s appointment as Agent hereunder, (a)&nbsp;such successor shall succeed to and
become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuing Bank,
(b)&nbsp;the retiring Issuing Bank shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and
obligations hereunder or under the other Credit Documents, and (c)&nbsp;the successor Issuing Lender
shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the
time of such succession or make other arrangement satisfactory to the retiring Issuing Lender to
effectively assume the obligations of the retiring Issuing Lender with respect to such Letters of
Credit.

Highest Lawful Rate, such excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal
