Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of its Ratable Share of the total of the Revolving
Credit Loans (each, a &#147;<U>Required Share</U>&#148;). Prior to 2:00 p.m. on such Settlement Date, each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent the amount equal to the difference between its
Required Share and its Revolving Credit Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall pay to each

respect to the Revolving Credit Loans. The Administrative Agent shall also effect settlement in
accordance with the foregoing sentence on the proposed Borrowing Dates for Revolving Credit Loans

to pay immediately to such Lender its Ratable Share of all payments made by the Borrower to the
