Seller shall (i) provide to Buyer copies of such work papers and other documents
relating to its preparation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Documents and the
Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value as Buyer may reasonably request, and (ii)
cooperate with, and make its personnel and facilities reasonably available to,
Buyer for the purpose of providing such other information as Buyer may
reasonably request concerning the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value.

            (c) Within 75 days after the Post-Closing Adjustment Documents are
delivered to Buyer, Buyer shall deliver written notice to Seller of any
disagreement with the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value (a "Notice of
Disagreement"), which Notice of Disagreement shall set forth each item in
disagreement and shall provide reasonable specificity

                                       13
<PAGE>

as to the basis for each disagreement and shall specify (to the extent
practicable) the total adjustment to the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value as
proposed by Seller as a result of such items in disagreement.

            (d) If Buyer does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement to Seller
within such 75 day period, the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto. If Buyer delivers a Notice of Disagreement
to Seller within such 75 day period, the parties shall (and shall cause their
respective auditors to) negotiate in good faith to resolve all disagreements as
promptly as practicable. Any changes in the Proposed Final Adjusted Book Value
that are agreed to by Buyer and Seller within 30 days of the aforementioned
delivery of the Notice of Disagreement shall be final and binding upon the
parties hereto and become part of the calculation of the final Adjusted Book
Value as of the First Closing Date (the "Final Adjusted Book Value"). If the
parties and their respective auditors are unable to resolve all disagreements
within 30 days of receipt by Seller of the Notice of Disagreement, then all
unresolved disagreements will be submitted within 10 days after such 30th day
for resolution in accordance herewith to an independent certified public
accounting firm of national standing and reputation as Buyer and Seller may
jointly select and retain (the "Settlement Auditor"), or if Buyer and Seller
cannot so agree, such Settlement Auditor shall be an independent certified
public accounting firm of national standing and reputation mutually acceptable
to Buyer's independent auditor and Seller's independent auditor. The parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and independent auditors to,
cooperate in good faith with the Settlement Auditor and shall give the
Settlement Auditor access to all books, records, work papers and other
information requested by the Settlement Auditor for purposes of such resolution.
The Settlement Auditor shall, within 60 days after its engagement, deliver to
Buyer and Seller a conclusive written resolution of all disagreements submitted
to it, including a definitive calculation of the Final Adjusted Book Value,
which shall be in accordance with this Agreement and shall be final and binding
upon the parties hereto and shall be so reflected in the calculation of the
First Closing Purchase Price; provided, however, that the dollar amount of each
item in dispute shall be determined within the range of dollar amounts proposed
by Buyer and Seller, respectively. Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half of
the fees and expenses of the Settlement Auditor.

            (e)   (i) In the event the amount of the Final Adjusted Book Value
exceeds $277,600,000, Buyer and Seller shall exchange the Note reflecting the
initial principal amount of $80,000,000 with a new Note, duly executed by Buyer
and otherwise identical to the Note issued on the First Closing Date in the
principal amount equal to $80,000,000 plus the amount by which the Final
Adjusted Book Value exceeds $277,600,000. Buyer and Seller shall exchange the
Note as provided in the preceding sentence on the date that the Final Adjusted
Book Value is final and binding on the parties hereto (the "Post-Closing
Settlement Date") and accrual of interest on the new Note shall be deemed to
have commenced as of the original issuance date of the Note in accordance with
the terms thereof.

                  (ii) In the event the Final Adjusted Book Value is less than
$277,600,000, Seller shall pay Buyer cash in the amount of such difference,
together with interest thereon at the rate equal to 6% per annum, calculated on
the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360 day year, from and
including the First Closing Date to but not including the date of such payment
(the "Post-Closing Cash Payment"). Seller shall deliver to Buyer the
Post-Closing Cash Payment on the Post-Closing Settlement Date.

            (f) Buyer agrees that it will make its books, records, systems,
personnel and other reasonable information and resources available to Seller
during normal business hours as reasonably required by Seller to satisfy its
obligations under this Section 2.2.

            (g) From the date hereof until the First Closing Date, Seller agrees
that it shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), permit any Insurance Subsidiary
to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its investment assets (other than
Excluded Assets) unless all of the gain recognized on such sale or other
disposition would be required by SAP to be reflected in the interest maintenance
reserve of the statutory balance sheet of such Insurance Subsidiary. Seller
further agrees to give Buyer reasonable notice of, and an opportunity to attend
and observe, all meetings of the investment committees of the Insurance
Subsidiaries from the date hereof until the first Closing Date.

            (a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. (i) Section 3.1(a)

laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.
The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary (other
than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect), and no other jurisdiction has claimed in
writing that the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is required to hold
a Permit issued by any Governmental Entity therein.

                 (iii) FFSB is a federal savings bank chartered under Section 5

subject to preemptive rights. Seller is the record and beneficial owner of the
Company Shares, free and clear of all Liens, other than any Liens arising solely

securities laws). There are not any securities, options, warrants, rights,
commitments or agreements of any kind to which Seller or the Company is a party
or by which either of them is bound obligating either of them to issue, sell or
deliver shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company.
Assuming Buyer has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful owner of
the Company Shares, upon delivery of and payment for the Company Shares at the

owner of the FLAC Shares, free and clear of all Liens, other than any Liens
arising solely from acts of Buyer (other than restrictions on transfer imposed

each Company Subsidiary were duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable, and are owned of record and beneficially by the Company,
by one or more of the Company's Subsidiaries or by the Company and one or more
of the Company's Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens. There are not any
securities, options, warrants, rights, commitments or agreements of any kind to
which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of them is bound obligating any of them to issue, sell or deliver shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of any of the Company Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth on Section 3.1(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company

all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller. This Agreement has been,
and each Transaction Document to be delivered by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement will have been as of the date each such Transaction Document is

Documents to be delivered by such Subsidiary pursuant to this Agreement and the

agreements or similar agreements for the purchase of the Buyer Common Shares in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, there are no
outstanding options, warrants, rights (including conversion or preemptive rights
and rights of first refusal) or proxy or stockholder agreements of any kind for
the purchase or acquisition from Buyer of any of its equity securities (other
than equity compensation arrangements for employees).

            SECTION 4.2. Access to Information; Confidentiality. (a) From the
date of this Agreement through the First Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) to afford to Buyer and its
Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable notice at reasonable times
during normal business hours to all of its properties, books, contracts,
commitments and records and, (ii) to furnish to Buyer such information
concerning its business, properties, financial condition, operations and
personnel as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request, other than any such
properties, books, contracts, commitments, records and information that (a) are

obligation of confidentiality; provided, however, that Buyer's investigation
shall be conducted in a manner that does not interfere in any material respect
with the Company's or the Company Subsidiaries' normal operations, customers and
employee relations. In the event that the FFSB Shares are not transferred to
Buyer at the First Closing, from the First Closing Date through the FFSB Closing
Date, Seller shall cause FFSB, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) to
afford to Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access upon reasonable notice
at reasonable times during normal business hours to all of its properties,
books, contracts, commitments and

                                       43
<PAGE>

records and, (ii) to furnish to Buyer such information concerning FFSB's
business, properties, financial condition, operations and personnel as Buyer may
from time to time reasonably request, other than any such properties, books,
contracts, commitments, records and information that (a) are subject to an
attorney-client or other legal privilege or (b) are subject to an obligation of
confidentiality; provided, however, that Buyer's investigation shall be
conducted in a manner that does not interfere in any material respect with
FFSB's normal operations, customers and employee relations. All requests for
access or information pursuant to this Section 4.2 shall be directed to such
Person or Persons as Seller shall designate. Without limiting the terms thereof,
the Confidentiality Agreement shall govern the obligations of Buyer and its
Representatives with respect to all information of any type furnished or made
available to them pursuant to this Section 4.2.

            (b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate as of the First
Closing. From and after the First Closing, Seller and its Affiliates (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, does not include the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, except for FFSB until the FFSB Closing) on the one hand, and Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, except
for FFSB until the FFSB Closing), on the other hand, shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, maintain in confidence, any written, oral
or other information relating to the other party or its Affiliates, except that
the foregoing requirements of this Section 4.2(b) shall not apply to the extent
that (i) any such information is or becomes generally available to the public
other than (A) in the case of Buyer, as a result of disclosure by Seller, its
Affiliates or any of its respective Representatives and (B) in the case of
Seller, as a result of disclosure by Buyer, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective
Representatives, (ii) any such information is required by applicable Law to be
disclosed after prior notice has been given to Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be or (iii) any such information was or becomes available to such party on a
non-confidential basis and from a source (other than a party to this Agreement
or any Affiliate or Representative of such party) that is not bound by a
confidentiality agreement.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in
any other agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are
bound, the obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein, as they
relate to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall not apply to
the Tax structure or Tax treatment of such transaction, and each party hereto
(and any employee, representative, or agent of any party hereto) may disclose to
any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax structure and Tax
treatment of such transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other tax analysis) that are provided to such party relating to such Tax
treatment and Tax structure; provided, however, that such disclosure may not be
made until the earlier of (x) the date of the public announcement of discussions
relating to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (y) the date
of the public announcement of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (z) the date of the execution of an agreement (with or without
conditions) to enter into any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided further, that such disclosure shall not include the name (or
other identifying information not relevant to the Tax structure or Tax
treatment) of any person and shall not include information for which
nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable
securities laws. The preceding sentence is intended to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to not be treated as having been offered under
conditions of confidentiality for purposes of Section 6011 and 6111 of the Code

                                       44
<PAGE>

(or any successor provision) and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, and shall be construed in a manner consistent with such purpose. In
addition, each party hereto acknowledges that it has no proprietary or exclusive
rights to the Tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Tax matter or Tax idea related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

            SECTION 4.3. Consents, Approvals and Filings. (a) Each of Seller and
Buyer will each use its commercially reasonable efforts, and will cooperate
fully with each other, (i) to comply as promptly as practicable with all
governmental requirements applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) to obtain as promptly as practicable all (x) necessary
Permits of Governmental Entities ("Governmental Consents") and (y) consents or
waivers of all third parties necessary in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
consents with respect to the agreements and other arrangements set forth on
Exhibits B-1, B-2 and C of the Disclosure Schedule (and, with respect to any
agreements or other arrangements set forth on Exhibit C of the Disclosure
Schedule for which consents cannot be obtained, each of Buyer and Seller will
use its commercially reasonable efforts, and will cooperate fully with each
other, to obtain appropriate substitution arrangements therefor prior to the
First Closing Date). In connection therewith, Seller and Buyer will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to make and cause their respective Affiliates to
make all legally required filings as promptly as is reasonably practicable in
order to facilitate prompt consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and will provide and will cause their respective Affiliates to
provide such information and communications to Governmental Entities as such
Governmental Entities may reasonably request. Each of the parties shall provide
to the other party copies of all applications or other communications to
Governmental Entities in connection with this Agreement in advance of the filing
or submission thereof.

            (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), as promptly
as reasonably practicable, Buyer shall file with all applicable Insurance
Regulators requests for approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including Form A filings, which requests shall include all required
exhibits. A reasonable time prior to furnishing any written materials or
presentations to any Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall furnish Seller with a copy thereof,
and Seller shall have a reasonable opportunity to provide comments thereon.
Buyer shall give to Seller prompt written notice if it receives any notice or
other communication from any Insurance Regulator in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, in the case of any such notice
or communication that is in writing, shall promptly furnish Seller with a copy
thereof. If any Insurance Regulator requires that a hearing be held in
connection with such approval, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange for such hearing to be held as promptly as is reasonably
practicable after the notice that such hearing is required has been received by
Buyer. Buyer shall give to Seller reasonable prior written notice of the time
and place when any meetings or other conferences may be held by it with any
Insurance Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and Seller shall have the right to have one representative, the
identity of whom shall be subject to Buyer's consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), attend or otherwise participate in any such
meeting or conference.

                                       45
<PAGE>

            (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, Buyer shall file such
regulatory applications or notices as are necessary to secure from the Banking
Regulators all such approvals, waivers, non-disapprovals or automatic
expirations of statutory waiting periods as may be required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in compliance with all applicable
Laws. A reasonable time prior to furnishing any written materials to any Banking
Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer shall furnish Seller with a copy thereof, and Seller shall have a
reasonable opportunity to provide comments thereon. Buyer shall give to Seller
prompt written notice if it receives any notice or other communication from any
Banking Regulator in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and, in the case of any such notice or communication that is in
writing, shall promptly furnish Seller with a copy thereof. Buyer shall give to
Seller reasonable prior written notice of the time and place when any meetings
or other conferences may be held by it with any Banking Regulator in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Seller shall have the
right to have one representative, the identity of whom shall be subject to
Buyer's consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
attend any such meeting or conference.

            (d) Without limiting the generality of Section 4.3(a), Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the First Closing, from
each Person that is a party to an investment advisory agreement with the
Investment Adviser Subsidiary, consent to the continuation of such investment
advisory agreement following consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

            SECTION 4.4. Public Announcements. Subject to the provisions of
Article X, Buyer and Seller, and their respective Affiliates, will consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the advance written approval
of the other party following such consultation (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may, in the opinion of counsel to
Seller, be required by Law or by the requirements of the SEC or any securities
exchange and except for statements to analysts, investors or prospective
investors that are not prohibited by Regulation FD under the Exchange Act. No
reference to the terms of the Securitization Financing or to XL Capital
Assurance Inc. will be made in any such news release or other public statement
without the prior approval of XL Capital Assurance Inc.

            SECTION 4.5. Intercompany Agreements and Accounts. Except as set
forth in Section 4.5 of the Disclosure Schedule, all intercompany agreements and
accounts between or among either Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than the
Company or any Company Subsidiary), on the one hand, and the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, on the other hand, will be terminated and cancelled without
payment prior to the First Closing, or with respect to FFSB, the FFSB Closing.
All intercompany agreements and accounts between or among the Company and any
Company Subsidiary in existence and in force as of the date hereof will remain
in effect and be in force on the First Closing Date. In the event that the FFSB
Shares are not transferred to Buyer at the First Closing, all agreements between
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (excluding FFSB), on the one hand, and
FFSB, on the other hand, in

                                       46
<PAGE>

existence and in force as of the date hereof will remain in effect and be in
force on the First Closing Date and the FFSB Closing Date.

            SECTION 4.6. Transaction Documents. At the First Closing, Buyer and
Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates (as appropriate) to,
execute and deliver to the other parties (as applicable) the Transaction
Documents. The Transaction Documents shall be in effect and in force immediately
after the First Closing and shall supersede all other rights and obligations
under the terminated intercompany agreements and accounts described in Section
4.5 of this Agreement.

            SECTION 4.7. Use of Names. (a) Following the First Closing, neither
Buyer nor any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (including the Company and any
Company Subsidiary) shall have any right to use, and they shall not use any of
the names or acronyms (including trademark(s)) set forth on Section 4.7(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule (the "Retained Names"), or any name that includes or is
confusingly similar to any of the foregoing, as a trademark or a servicemark in
any corporate name, trade name with respect to any product or otherwise in any
jurisdiction, except as set forth in the TCP Agreement. In furtherance of the
above, on or prior to the First Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries (i) to make all filings and take all such other
action as is necessary to wind down and cease the use of any of the foregoing
names or any derivation thereof in any manner whatsoever, and (ii) to transfer
and assign all rights that any of them may have in any of the foregoing names to
Seller or as Seller may direct.

            (b) Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to wind down
and cease its use, and will cause all Affiliates of Seller to cease their use,
of the trade names, trademarks and service marks that are listed in Section
4.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule (the "Names"), which use shall cease within
six months after the First Closing (other than inadvertently); provided,
however, that Seller and any Affiliates of Seller may continue to use the Names,
without payment therefor: (i) in the performance of their obligations under the
Transition Services Agreements, the TCP Agreement or the FFSB Agreement; (ii) in
filings or reports made or filings submitted to government or regulatory
authorities in Tax Returns, in litigation and claims and in similar corporate
purposes involving the business of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries or
as otherwise necessary to refer to or identify the business as operated before
the Names were changed pursuant hereto; (iii) in editorial, non-trademark usages
or descriptive uses of the Names (or parts thereof); and (iv) for a period of
one year from the First Closing, or if applicable, the FFSB Closing or for such
additional period as Buyer may agree, such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, to the extent that the Names remain on existing documents,
papers, policies, inventory, reports, agreements and similar items.

            (c) For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer agrees that it is acquiring
only the Names set forth in Section 4.7(b) of the Disclosure Schedule and shall
have no rights to use any names or acronyms (including trademarks, service marks
or trade names) owned or used by Seller and its Subsidiaries except as set forth
in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

            SECTION 4.8. Access to Books and Records; Cooperation. Following the
First Closing, each of Seller and Buyer shall (and Buyer shall cause the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries to) preserve and keep the records held by them
relating to the respective businesses

                                       47
<PAGE>

of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for a period of six (6) years from
the First Closing Date or, with respect to FFSB, the FFSB Closing Date, and
shall make such records and personnel available to the other as may be
reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things, any
insurance claims by, legal proceedings by or against or governmental
investigations of Seller, Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Affiliates or in order to enable Seller or Buyer to comply with
their respective obligations under this Agreement and each other agreement,
document or instrument contemplated hereby. In the event that Seller or Buyer
wishes to destroy (or permit to be destroyed) such records after that time, such
party shall first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other and
such other party shall have the right at its option and expense, upon prior
written notice given to such party within that ninety (90) day period, to take
possession of the records within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the

directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in the
ownership, management, operation or control (or derive, receive or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the profits or other material economic benefits) of
any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise (including joint ventures, co-marketing arrangements, alliances and
other similar relationships), engaged in issuing, selling or marketing
"pre-need" insurance, annuity or trust products or other final expense planning

restrictions contained in this Section 4.9(a) shall not restrict Seller from
performing its obligations under the FFSB Agreement or the TCP Agreement or any
other activities relating to insurance policies issued under the TCP Program of
Seller prior to the First Closing Date and shall not restrict the acquisition by
Seller or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of less than five
percent of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged
in a Seller Restricted Business. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and
agree that the remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate
and that Buyer, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be
entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of
proving actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever.

            (b) For a period of two years following the First Closing Date,

on or prior to the Closing Date; or (ii) solicit for employment any person in
the employ of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; provided, however, the
above clause will not prohibit (x) any general solicitation of employment not
specifically directed toward employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or (y) any employee terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.

            (c) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, during the
Designated Period, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates, not to,
directly or indirectly, own, manage, operate, control or participate in the
ownership, management, operation or control (or derive, receive or participate,
directly or indirectly, in the profits or other material economic benefits) of
any business, whether in corporate, proprietorship or partnership form or
otherwise

similar relationships), engaged in manufacturing, designing, marketing or
selling funeral caskets, cremation containers and urns and similar vessels or
containers, and software products and consulting services related to "at need"
funeral ceremonial services or grief counseling (a "Buyer Restricted Business");
provided, however, that the restrictions contained in this Section 4.9(c) shall
not restrict Buyer from performing its obligations under the TCP Agreement and
shall not restrict the acquisition by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, directly
or indirectly, of less than five percent of the outstanding capital stock of any
publicly traded company engaged in a Buyer Restricted Business. The parties
hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach
of the foregoing will be inadequate and that Seller, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive
relief without the necessity of proving actual damage or posting any bond
whatsoever.

            (d) For a period of two years following the First Closing Date,

clause will not prohibit (x) any general solicitation of employment not
specifically directed toward employees of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
(y) any employee terminated by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (e) During the Designated Period, Buyer shall not and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, cause, induce or encourage any material actual or
prospective client, customer, supplier, or licensor of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any existing or former customer Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person that becomes a client or customer of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries after the First Closing) or any other Person who has a
material business relationship with Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, to
terminate or modify any such actual or prospective relationship.

            (f) Seller and its Affiliates shall not, and shall cause each of
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize,
recommend, propose or enter into, any transaction involving a merger,
consolidation, business combination, purchase or disposition of the assets or
capital stock of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an "Acquisition Transaction"), (ii)
facilitate, encourage, solicit or initiate discussions, negotiations or
submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction,
(iii) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person, any information
concerning the business, operations, properties or assets of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with an Acquisition Transaction, or (iv)
otherwise cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, facilitate or
encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the
foregoing. Seller will inform Buyer in writing immediately following the receipt
by Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, representatives and agents of any proposal or inquiry in
respect of any Acquisition Transaction.

            (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, may participate in any co-marketing arrangement similar to the TCP Program
with a third party

                                       49
<PAGE>

(regardless of form) that would otherwise constitute a Buyer Restricted Business
or Seller Restricted Business, as the case may be, if the following conditions
are satisfied:

                        (A) prior to seeking to enter into such arrangement with
            a third party, the party proposing such arrangement ("Offeror")
            first proposes to enter into such arrangement with the other party
            hereto ("Offeree");

                        (B) after a period of 30 days (during which the parties
            shall have good faith discussions and negotiations concerning such
            proposal), the parties fail to agree on mutually satisfactory terms
            and conditions on which they would agree to engage in such activity;

                        (C) after the expiration of such 30 day period, Offeror
            proposes the material economic terms of the proposed arrangement in
            reasonable detail in writing (the "Definitive Proposal") to the
            Offeree and the Offeree fails to accept the terms thereof within 10
            days after receipt of the Definitive Proposal (the "Offer Expiration
            Date"); and

                        (D) the Offeror enters into a definitive agreement with
            a third party on terms that are no more favorable to the third party
            than those offered to the Offeree in the Definitive Proposal within
            90 days after the Offer Expiration Date.

            SECTION 4.10. Company Investment Assets. From the date of this
Agreement until the First Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to comply with the investment guidelines set forth in
Section 3.1(x)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement to the First Closing Date,
Seller shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to provide Mr.
Douglas Schair with reasonable advance notice of, and the right to attend as an
observer, any meetings of any investment management committee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

            SECTION 4.11. Excluded Assets; Dividend of FFSB Shares; Loan
Repayment. (a) Prior to the First Closing, Seller will purchase from the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, without any representation or warranty from, or
recourse to, the Company or any Company Subsidiary, all of the Company's and the
Company Subsidiaries' right, title and interest in and to each of the assets set
forth in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Excluded
Assets") for an aggregate purchase price equal to the book value of the Excluded
Assets (or such other purchase price required by the applicable Insurance
Regulator) as of the date of the purchase in cash to be paid prior to the First
Closing.

            (b) Seller will, prior to the First Closing, assume all Liabilities
of the Company and of the Company Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, unfunded commitments of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) related to
the Excluded Assets and shall, at Buyer's request, obtain a release of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any commitment or other
Liability from the obligee thereof.

                                       50

            (c) In the event that the FFSB Shares will not be transferred to
Buyer at the First Closing, Seller shall cause the Company to instead declare
and pay a dividend-in-kind to Seller of all of the FFSB Shares on or prior to
the First Closing.

            (d) Seller will, prior to the First Closing, repay to FLIC in full
all indebtedness owed by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company
or any Company Subsidiary) to FLIC, if any (whether or not yet due). For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.11(d) shall not apply to the loans identified
in Section 4.13 or any other indebtedness owed to FLIC by the partnerships and
limited liability companies relating to the Excluded Assets.

            SECTION 4.12. Financing. Buyer shall obtain not less than
$41,300,000 in cash from the issuance of its common stock prior to the First
Closing. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
deliver the proceeds of the Securitization Financing at the First Closing. In
order to assist with obtaining the Securitization Financing, Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, provide such assistance
and cooperation as Buyer and its Affiliates may reasonably request, including
causing the relevant Insurance Subsidiaries to enter into the Reinsurance
Agreements effective upon the First Closing.

            SECTION 4.13. Pre-payment of Loans. Following the First Closing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to take
all actions reasonably requested by Seller to permit Seller or its Affiliates
(including, without limitation, Cornerstone Partners I, LLC, San Francisco Hotel
Group, LLC and Cambridge Hotel, LLC) to pre-pay or refinance the loans evidenced
by the secured promissory note in the principal amount of $22,750,000, dated as

Life Insurance Company and the promissory note in the principal amount of
$39,650,000, dated as of May 18, 2003, by Cornerstone Partners II, LLC in favor

notwithstanding any pre-payment restrictions or penalty provisions under such
loans.

its commercially reasonable efforts to qualify as an entity permitted to acquire
a federal thrift or federal thrift holding company (including for these purposes
FFSB) under the conditions set forth in Section 401(a) of the GLB and Section
10(c)9(A) of the HOLA.

expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            SECTION 4.16. Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer agree, and
Seller, prior to the First Closing, or with respect to FFSB, the FFSB Closing,
and Buyer, after the First Closing, or with respect to FFSB, the FFSB Closing,
agree to cause the Company and each Company Subsidiary, to execute and deliver
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other

                                       51

writings and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in
order to consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by

practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall, at its own expense, to the
satisfaction of Buyer, use commercially reasonable efforts to amend, correct, or
take any other action, if any, reasonably necessary to (i) cause all life
insurance policies issued or to be issued by the Insurance Subsidiaries to

similar provisions of state or local Law).

            SECTION 4.20. Obligations under Retention Agreements. Seller shall
make the payments to Stephen R. Lang and Ronald J. Marek required under Section
3(a) of the applicable Retention Agreement that are due and payable upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

individual capitalization of each Subsidiary of Buyer, in each case after giving
effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement,
the Transaction Documents and the Securitization Financing, and (y) the pro
forma ownership of each Subsidiary of Buyer, giving effect to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents

on the First Closing, FFSB shall not be deemed a Subsidiary of the Company until

shall not be treated as having been satisfied in the event there is any change
in the law, fact or change in any of the terms of this Agreement or Note between

            SECTION 7.2. Conditions to Obligations of Buyer. The obligations of
Buyer to effect the purchase and sale of the FFSB Shares and the other actions
to be taken at the FFSB Closing are further subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by Buyer on or prior to the FFSB Closing Date of the following
conditions:

            (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Seller in this Agreement, to the extent and only to the extent
they apply to FFSB and/or the FFSB Closing, shall be true and correct as of the
FFSB Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation and warranty
speaks as of an earlier date, in which event such representation and warranty
shall be true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct (without giving effect to
any limitation as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse Effect" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" contained therein) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, properties,
financial condition or results of operations of FFSB or a material adverse
effect on the ability of Seller to consummate the sale and purchase of FFSB
contemplated by this Agreement; and Buyer shall have received a certificate
signed on behalf of Seller by an executive officer of Seller to the effect set
forth in this paragraph.

            (b) Performance of Obligations of Seller. Seller shall have
performed in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement to the extent and only to the extent they apply to FFSB
and/or the FFSB Closing on or prior to the FFSB Closing Date, and Buyer shall
have received a certificate signed on behalf of Seller by an executive officer
of Seller to such effect.

            (c) Tax Certificates. The Seller shall have provided the Buyer with
a certificate (which complies with Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder) of non-foreign status executed in accordance
with the provisions of the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act and
Section 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

            SECTION 7.3. Conditions to Obligations of Seller. The obligations of
Seller to effect the purchase and sale of the FFSB Shares and the other actions
to be taken at the FFSB Closing are further subject to the satisfaction or
waiver by Seller on or prior to the FFSB Closing Date of the following
conditions:

            (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of Buyer in this Agreement, to the extent and only to the extent they
apply to FFSB and/or the FFSB Closing, shall be true and correct as of the FFSB
Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation and warranty speaks
as of an earlier date, in which event such representation and warranty shall be
true and correct as of such date), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct (without giving effect
to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or
"Material Adverse Effect" contained

                                       57
<PAGE>

therein) would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material
Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
Transaction Documents; and Seller shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of Buyer by an executive officer of Buyer to the effect set forth in this
paragraph.

            (b) Performance of Obligations of Buyer. Buyer shall have performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
this Agreement to the extent and only to the extent they apply to FFSB and/or
the FFSB Closing on or prior to the FFSB Closing Date, and Seller shall have
received a certificate signed on behalf of Buyer by an executive officer of
Buyer to such effect.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                   SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            SECTION 8.1. Survival of Representations and Warranties. Except for
the representations and warrantees set forth in Sections 3.1(i)(v) and 3.1(k),
which shall terminate as provided in Section 10.8(c), representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the First Closing and the
FFSB Closing solely for purposes of Sections 9.1(a) and 9.1(b), and shall
terminate and expire at the close of business on the date that is 18 months
after the First Closing Date, or with respect to FFSB, the FFSB Closing Date,
except for: (a) those representations contained in Section 3.1(j), 3.1(cc) and
3.1(ff), which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period, (b) those representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.1(d), 3.1(bb), 3.2(a), 3.2(b), 3.2(c),
3.2(d), 3.2(i) and 3.2(j) which shall survive indefinitely and (c) Section
3.1(h) which shall survive two years from the First Closing Date, or with
respect to FFSB, the FFSB Closing Date. All covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement, to the extent that the foregoing by their express terms are
to have effect or be performed after the First Closing or the FFSB Closing shall
survive the First Closing or the FFSB Closing, as the case may be, in accordance
with their terms.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            SECTION 9.1. Obligation to Indemnify. (a) Subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article IX, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
and its Affiliates (including the Company and Company Subsidiaries), and their
respective directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns (the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") from and against all losses and out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of outside counsel and
irrespective of whether or not such losses and expenses arise out of or in
connection with a Third Party Claim) but not including punitive, consequential,
all other kinds of special damages and Taxes or any amounts related to any claim
for an indemnity based on or relating to Taxes ("Losses") to the extent actually
incurred as a result of, based upon, or in connection with (i) any failure of
the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement to be
true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the First Closing Date, and to
the extent and only to the extent they apply to FFSB and/or the FFSB Closing,
the FFSB Closing Date, (ii) any breach of

                                       58
<PAGE>

any of the covenants and agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii)
liability incurred under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any pension plan
maintained or contributed to by Seller or any corporation, trade or business
under common control or treated as a single employer with Seller, (iv) the
Excluded Assets, or (v) any failure by BCC to satisfy its obligations to The
Forethought Group, Inc. under the Assignment and Assumption Agreement; provided,
however, that Seller shall not have any liability for Losses under this
Agreement except as otherwise provided herein unless the aggregate of all Losses
for which Seller would, but for this proviso, be liable exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to $5,500,000 (the "Indemnification Basket"), and then
only to the extent such Losses exceed $1,500,000; provided, further, that Seller
shall not have any liability for indemnification under this Agreement for any
individual item of Loss that is less than $25,000 (unless such item of Loss
would, when aggregated with each other item of Loss arising from the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances, equals or exceeds $25,000). The
maximum amount for which Seller shall be liable in the aggregate under Section
9.1(a) shall not exceed $90,000,000 (the "Indemnification Cap"). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Indemnification Basket nor the Indemnification Cap
shall apply to claims for Losses as a result of, based upon, or in connection
with (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in
Sections 3.1(a), 3.1(b), 3.1(c), 3.1(d) and 3.1(bb), (ii) any breach of any of
the covenants and agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement, (iii)
liability incurred under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any pension plan
maintained or contributed to by Seller or any corporation, trade or business
under common control or treated as a single employer with Seller, (iv) the
Excluded Assets and (v) any failure by BCC to satisfy its obligations to The
Forethought Group, Inc. under the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

            (b) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX and not
including any indemnification with respect to a breach of the covenants provided
in Section 10.7(d), Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates (excluding the Company and Company Subsidiaries) and their respective
directors, officers, employees, successors and assigns (the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") from and against all Losses to the extent actually incurred as a
result of, based upon, or in connection with (i) the failure of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement to be true
and correct as of the date hereof and as of the First Closing Date, or to the
extent and only to the extent they apply to FFSB and/or the FFSB Closing, the
FFSB Closing Date; (ii) any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of
Buyer contained in this Agreement; (iii) the ownership by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the operation of the business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent such Losses are
incurred as a result of any breach of the representations and warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement or any breach of any of the covenants and
agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement that survive the First Closing,
or to the extent and only to the extent they apply to FFSB and/or the FFSB
Closing; or (iv) any Third Party Claim arising from any equity or debt financing
obtained or arranged by Buyer (including, without limitation, the Securitization
Financing) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that Buyer shall not have any liability under this Agreement unless the
aggregate of all Losses for which Buyer would, but for this proviso, be liable
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to the Indemnification Basket, and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed $1,500,000; provided, further, that
Buyer shall not have any liability for indemnification under this Agreement for
any individual item of Loss that is less than $25,000 (unless such item of Loss
would, when aggregated with each other item of Loss arising from the same
underlying facts, events or circumstances, equals or exceeds $25,000).

                                       59
<PAGE>

The maximum amount for which Buyer shall be liable in the aggregate under this
Section 9.1(b) shall not exceed the Indemnification Cap. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Indemnification Basket nor the Indemnification Cap shall
apply to claims for Losses as a result of, based upon, or in connection with (i)
any breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in Sections
3.2(a), 3.2(b), 3.2(c), 3.2(d) and 3.2(i) and (ii) any breach of any of the
covenants and agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement.

            (c) For purposes of this Article IX and for purposes of determining
whether any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from Seller,
or any Seller Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from Buyer,
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b) hereof, any breach of or inaccuracy
in any representation or warranty of Buyer or Seller shall be determined without
regard to any materiality qualifications set forth in such representation or
warranty, and all references to the terms "material", "materially",
"materiality", "Material Adverse Effect", "Company Material Adverse Effect",
"Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or any similar terms shall be ignored for
purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty was true and
correct when made or deemed to have been made.

            SECTION 9.2. Indemnification Procedures. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under Section 9.1 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give the
party from which such indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party")
notice in writing of the assertion of any claim or demand made by, or an action,
proceeding or investigation instituted by, any Person not a party to this
Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under such Section promptly after such Indemnified Party learns of the Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party, within five Business Days after the Indemnified Party's receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

            (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
by providing notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within 20 Business Days
of the receipt of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; provided that (i) the
Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with an unqualified
acknowledgment in writing (at the time it elects to assume such defense) of its
obligation under this Section 9.2 to indemnify the Indemnified Party with
respect to such Third Party Claim, (ii) such counsel is approved by the
Indemnified Party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
(iii) the Indemnified Party is kept fully informed of all developments, and is
furnished with copies of all documents and papers, related thereto and is given
the right to participate in the defense and investigation thereof as provided
below, and (iv) such counsel proceeds with diligence and in good faith with
respect thereto. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not as long as it conducts such
defense be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ its own counsel,
separate from the counsel employed by the

                                       60
<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party at its own expense, except that the Indemnifying Party shall
bear the expense of such separate counsel if (A) in the written opinion of
counsel to the Indemnified Party reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying
Party, use of counsel of the Indemnifying Party's choice would be expected to
give rise to a conflict of interest or (B) there are or may be legal defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party
for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third
Party Claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's
prior written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a settlement offer
solely for money damages is made by a Third Party Claimant, and the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing of the Indemnifying Party's
willingness to accept the settlement offer and, subject to the applicable
limitations of Section 9.1, pay the amount called for by such offer, and the
Indemnified Party declines to accept such offer, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any participation by the
Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay
hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement
offer that the Indemnified Party declined to accept plus the Losses of the
Indemnified Party relating to such Third Party Claim through the date of its
rejection of the settlement offer or (B) the aggregate Losses of the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim.

            SECTION 9.3. Termination. (a) The indemnities provided in this
Agreement shall survive the First Closing and, with respect to FFSB and matters
related to the FFSB Closing, the FFSB Closing; provided, however, that the
indemnities provided under Sections 9.1(a)(i) and 9.1(b)(i) shall terminate when
the applicable representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Article VIII
and Section 10.8(c), except as to any item as to which the Person to be
indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice (stating in reasonable detail the
basis of such claim) to the Indemnifying Party. Except as provided in Article X,
and other than with respect to the covenants and agreements contained in
Sections 4.4, 4.7, 4.8 and 4.9, after the First Closing (other than with respect
to FFSB) and the FFSB Closing (with respect to FFSB) the indemnities provided in
Sections 9.1(a) and 9.1(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy at law or in
equity for any breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
other claim arising out of this Agreement.

            (b) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement shall be net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by the
Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to such Losses and shall
be (i) increased to take account of any Tax cost incurred (grossed up for such
increase) by the Indemnified Party arising from the receipt of indemnity
payments hereunder, and (ii) reduced to take account of any Tax benefit

                                       61
<PAGE>

realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any
such Losses. Such Tax cost or Tax benefit, as the case may be, shall be computed
for any year using the Indemnified Party's actual Tax liability with and without
(i) the receipt of any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement
and (ii) the incurrence or payment of any Losses for which indemnification is
provided under this Agreement in such year. In the event that the Indemnified
Party actually realizes a Tax cost or Tax benefit for a year(s) subsequent to
the year in which the indemnity payment is made, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay the amount of such Tax cost or the Indemnified Party shall pay the amount of
such Tax benefit, as the case may be, in such subsequent year(s).

            SECTION 9.4. Tax Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the rights and obligations of the parties with
respect to indemnification for any and all matters relating to Taxes shall be
governed exclusively by Article X of this Agreement.

            SECTION 9.5. Set-off. At the election of Seller, any indemnification
payment payable by Seller to Buyer or any of its Affiliates under Article IX or
Article X hereof, other than indemnification payments in respect of Assigned
Rights (which shall be made without setoff), may be applied, on a dollar for
dollar basis, against amounts payable by Buyer under the Note, as provided
therein.

                                   ARTICLE X

                                   TAX MATTERS

            SECTION 10.1. (a) Indemnification. Seller agrees to pay, indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against the following
Taxes including with respect to clause (v) amounts paid on a claim (except as
specifically provided in Section 10.6 and to the extent such Taxes are reflected
in the Final Adjusted Book Value or as disclosed on Sections 3.1(k) or 10.1 of
the Disclosure Schedule) and, except as otherwise provided in Section 10.4,
against any loss, damage, liability or expense, including reasonable fees for
attorneys and other outside consultants, incurred in contesting or otherwise in
connection with any such Taxes (and with respect to clause (v) any claim): (i)
Taxes imposed on the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries with respect to
taxable periods or portions thereof (as determined pursuant to Section 10.1(b)
of this Agreement) ending on or before the First Closing Date (other than Taxes
resulting from a transaction (not including, however, any transaction deemed to
occur as a result of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections) occurring on the First
Closing Date but after the First Closing that is not in the Ordinary Course of
Business of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or the transactions
occurring pursuant to the Reinsurance Agreement); (ii) Taxes imposed for any
taxable period on any member (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiary)
of an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section 1504(a)(1) of the Code or
any similar provision under state, local or foreign Law) with which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary was a member on or before the First Closing; (iii)
Except as provided in clause (z) of the next sentence hereof, any Tax, whether
with respect to taxable periods before or after the First Closing Date that
relate to annuity contracts or life insurance policies issued on or prior to the
First Closing, resulting from a breach of the representation set forth in
Section 3.1(k)(xv) (without giving effect to any limitation as to
"materiality"); (iv) Except as provided in clause (z) of the next sentence
hereof, with respect to any life insurance policy or annuity contract that is

                                       62
<PAGE>

issued after the First Closing Date but before the first anniversary of the
First Closing Date that does not differ materially from the form of life
insurance policies or annuity contracts that are currently in use by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary or that are issued in reliance on the computer
software or programming (or any other analytical systems) that are currently
used by the Company or Company Subsidiaries to calculate the statutorily
mandated amounts required to qualify as a life insurance policy under Section
7702 of the Code (or any similar provision of state or local Law), Taxes
resulting from such policies and contracts not complying with the requirements
of sections 7702 of the Code (or any analogous provision of state or local Law)
or not being qualified under section 72 of the Code (or any analogous provision
of state or local Law), but with respect to (iv) only to the extent that: (A)
Buyer has complied with the requirements of Section 10.1(d), or (B) Buyer has
not Knowingly issued life insurance policies or annuities contracts that are not
in compliance with Section 7702 or qualified under Section 72 of the Code (and
any analogous provision under state or local Law), as applicable and (v) Except
as provided in clause (z) of the next sentence hereof, any amounts paid in
connection with, or in settlement or satisfaction of any claim made by a holder
of an insurance policy or annuity contract described in clauses (iii) or (iv)
hereof. Buyer shall indemnify, pay and hold harmless Seller for: (x) Taxes
attributable to, imposed on, related or allocated to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any associated Losses not otherwise allocated to Seller pursuant
to the first sentence hereof; (y) Taxes and Losses resulting from a breach by
Buyer of any of the covenants made under Section 10.7(d) of this Agreement (as
provided and determined pursuant to Section 10.7(d)) and (z) notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary, Buyer shall pay (A) the first $100,000 of attorney
fees incurred with respect to legal representation in connection with Taxes
described in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v) of this Section 10.1 and (B) 30 percent
of all Taxes described in clauses (iii), (iv) or (v) of the immediately
preceding sentence hereof and 30 percent of all expenses incurred by Seller
pursuant to Section 10.1(d); provided, however, for purposes of this sub-clause
(B) Buyer's liability shall not exceed $500,000. Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, Tax Indemnified Losses shall be paid in full
and shall not be subject to the Indemnification Basket or the Indemnification
Cap provided for in Section 9.1(a).

            (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable
period that begins before the First Closing Date and ends after the First
Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of
the period ending on the First Closing Date shall be:

                  (i) in the case of Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or Taxes resulting from
transactions (A) occurring on the First Closing Date after the First Closing
that are not in the ordinary course of the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's
business or (B) resulting from the Reinsurance Agreement) that are either (x)
based upon or related to income, premiums or receipts, or (y) imposed in
connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or
personal, tangible or intangible), deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the taxable year ended with (and included) the First Closing Date;
and

                  (ii) in the case of Taxes (other than Taxes as described in
clause (i) above) imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or otherwise measured by the level of any
item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the

                                       63
<PAGE>

amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the period
ending on the First Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire period

            (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
the sale of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries are, for any reason, held or
determined not to qualify for treatment as a deemed sale of assets (in whole or
in part) pursuant to section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and to the extent relevant,
any other similar provision under state or local law), Buyer shall pay to Seller
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (A) any Tax benefit that Buyer
actually realizes (which for the avoidance of doubt a Tax benefit shall include,
without limitation, any Tax benefit Buyer realizes from the use of any
depreciation, amortization, deduction or loss, or any pre or post First Closing
Tax attribute of the Company or any Company Subsidiary) that Buyer would not
have been entitled to if the transaction had qualified as a deemed sale of
assets pursuant to section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and to the extent relevant,
any other similar provision of state or local Law) over (B) (i) the amount of
any payments that Buyer is required to make pursuant to Section 10.7(d) less
(ii) any amounts Buyer recovers under Section 10.3(b).

            (d) Buyer shall, at its own expense, as promptly as is reasonably
practicable after the First Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to
investigate, identify, amend, correct, create substitute forms or take any other
actions necessary to cause the life insurance policies or annuity contracts
issued in the forms referred to in Section 10.1(a)(iv) (for which Buyer intends
to continue to issue life insurance policies or annuity contracts using such
forms) or in reliance on the computer software or programming or analytical
systems referred to in Section 10.1(a)(iv) to qualify as life insurance
contracts under Section 7702 of the Code or annuity contracts under Section 72
of the Code, as applicable. Subject to clause (z) of Section 10.1(a), Seller
shall reimburse Buyer for any costs incurred by any Buyer Indemnified Party in
connection with Buyer's obligations under this Section 10.1(d) (other than any
such costs incurred in investigating or identifying non-complying policies or
contracts (and the forms thereto) or failing computer software, program or other
analytical systems).

            SECTION 10.2. Returns and Payments. (a) Except as provided for in
Section 10.7 of this Agreement, from the date of this Agreement through and
after the First Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish
in proper form to the appropriate Tax Authority (or cause to be prepared and
filed or so furnished) in a timely manner: (i) all consolidated, unitary,
combined or similar Tax Returns (the "Consolidated Tax Returns") that include or
would include the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries, and (ii) all other Tax
Returns not including the Consolidated Tax Returns that relate to the Company
and the Company's Subsidiaries that are due on or before or relate to any
taxable period ending on or before the First Closing Date; and Buyer shall do
the same with respect to all Tax Returns that include or relate to a taxable
period ending after the First Closing Date. (The party with the obligation to
file a Tax Return as determined under the preceding sentence shall hereinafter
be referred to as the "Filing Party".) Tax Returns of the Company and the
Company's Subsidiaries for any taxable period that begins before the First
Closing Date and that ends after the First Closing Date shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries (except to the extent counsel for the Filing Party
renders a legal opinion that there is no substantial authority in law as that
standard is defined pursuant to Treasury Regulation

1.6662-4(d)(3) or determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed
without being subject to penalties). With respect to any Tax Return required to
be filed by Buyer or Seller (as required by the first sentence of this Section
10.2(a)) with respect to the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries and as to
which an amount of Tax is allocable to the other party under Section 10.1 (the
"Tax Indemnifying Party"), the Filing Party shall provide the Tax Indemnifying
Party and its authorized representatives with: (1) a copy of such completed Tax
Return or in the case of a Consolidated Tax Return, (i) the pro-forma
Consolidated Tax Return, if any, filed by the Insurance Subsidiaries that does
not include the Company, and (ii) a pro forma Tax Return for the Company and the
Company's Subsidiaries (prepared on a separate company basis), and (2) a
statement certifying and setting forth the calculation of the amount of Tax
shown on such Tax Return or Consolidated Tax Return (as the case may be) that is
allocable to such Tax Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 10.1, together with
appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 20 Business Days prior
to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax
Return. Such Tax Indemnifying Party and its authorized representatives shall
have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to
the filing of such Tax Return.

            (b) Seller shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable all
Taxes allocated to Seller pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.1 to the
extent that such Tax is shown on a Tax Return that Seller is required to file
(or caused to be filed) pursuant to the terms of paragraph (a) above and Buyer
shall do the same with respect to Tax Returns Buyer is required to file.

            (c) In any case where a Filing Party files (or causes to be filed) a
Tax Return on which there is an amount of Tax that is allocable to a Tax
Indemnifying Party, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall pay the Filing Party the
amount so allocated to it pursuant to Section 10.1 at least three Business Days
before the due date of the Tax Return required to be filed by the Filing Party
(pursuant to Section 10.2(a)) or within three Business Days following an
agreement between Seller and Buyer that an indemnity amount is payable by the
other, or within 3 days of (i) an assessment of a Tax by a Tax Authority, or
(ii) a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code has been made.
If liability under this Article X is in respect of costs or expenses other than
Taxes, payment by the Tax Indemnifying Party of any amounts due under this
Article X shall be made within five Business Days after the date when the Tax
Indemnifying Party has been notified by the Filing Party that the Tax
Indemnifying Party has a liability for a determinable amount under this Article
X and is provided with calculations and all other materials reasonably necessary
to support such liability.

            SECTION 10.3. Refunds. (a) Except as provided in Section 10.1(c) and
10.3(b), any Tax refund or credit (including any interest with respect thereto)
relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any taxable period or
portion thereof ending on or prior to the First Closing Date, to the extent in
excess of amounts reflected therefor in the Final Adjusted Book Value, shall be
the property of Seller, and if received by Buyer, the Company or any of the
Company's Subsidiaries such Tax refund or credit shall be paid over promptly to
Seller together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum compounded
daily, calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a 360
day year, for the period from and including the date which 10 Business Days
after such tax refund or credit was received by Buyer or the Company

                                       65
<PAGE>

or one of its Subsidiaries as relevant to and including the date Seller actually
receives payment of such tax refund or credit from Buyer.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything in this agreement to the contrary, in
the event the sale of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries is not (in whole
or in part), for any reason, treated as a deemed sale of assets pursuant to
section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any similar provision under state or local
law), Buyer agrees, at Seller's request and expense, that it will or will cause
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to carryback any (i) losses that relate or
are attributable to any built-in loss (calculated as of the First Closing Date
and equal to the excess of the Tax basis of any such asset over such assets
allocable fair market value as of such date), or (ii) Tax benefits or Tax
attributes that would not have otherwise been available to Buyer had the sale
been treated as a deemed sale of assets. Any Tax refund resulting from such
carryback shall be paid to Buyer to the extent of any payments made by Buyer
pursuant to Section 10.7(d). Except as provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, Buyer, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and any of their
Affiliates shall have no obligation to carryback any loss or other Tax item.

            SECTION 10.4. Contests. (a) After the First Closing, Buyer or Seller
shall notify the other party in writing within seven days of receiving any
written notice of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit or administrative
or judicial proceeding which, if determined adversely to such entity, would be
subject to indemnification under this Article X; provided, however, that a
failure to give such notice will not affect a party's right to indemnification
under this Article X except to the extent, if any, that, but for such failure,
Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, could reasonably likely have avoided all or
a portion of the Tax liability to which such written notice relates.

            (b) In the case of an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding
(a "Tax Contest") that relates to periods ending on or before the First Closing
Date (including, without limitation, any Tax Contest relating to life insurance
policies or annuities issued by a Company Subsidiary prior to the First
Closing), Seller shall have the sole right at its own expense, to control the
conduct of any such Tax Contest; provided, however, that if Seller does not
exercise such right to control, Buyer, at its own expense, may assume such
control in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited
to, settling such Tax Contest (subject to the requirement of Section 10.4(d))
after giving five days prior written notice to Seller setting forth the terms
and conditions of settlement.

            (c) In case of a Tax Contest that relates to periods beginning
before and ending after the First Closing Date, the party that is liable for the
issue pursuant to the terms of this Section 10.1 shall control the audit or
proceeding with respect thereto; provided, however, that if the Tax Contest
involves issues relating to potential adjustments or assessments for which both
Seller and Buyer, the Company or any Company Subsidiary could be liable, (i)
each party may participate in the Tax Contest, and (ii) the Tax Contest shall be
controlled by that party that would bear the burden of the greater portion of
the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding adjustments that may reasonably
be anticipated for future Tax periods; provided further, however, that with
respect to any Tax Contest, as described in the first proviso of this paragraph
(c), that relates to or involves any Tax issues regarding or relating to life
insurance policies or annuities, Buyer and Seller shall jointly control such Tax
Contest. The principle set

                                       66
<PAGE>

forth in the first sentence of this Section 10.4(c) shall govern also for
purposes of deciding any issue that must be decided jointly (including, without
limitation, choice of judicial forum) in situations in which separate issues are
otherwise controlled under this Article X by Buyer and Seller.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Seller shall have the right to control any proceeding or Tax Contest
that relates to the issue of whether the Section 338(h)(10) Elections should be
respected, provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to approve of any
counsel, such approval to not be unreasonably withheld, chosen by Seller to
represent Seller in such Tax Contest and Buyer shall have the right to
participate in such Tax Contest at its own expense in the same manner as
provided in paragraph (b) of this Section 10.4, including, without limitation,
to the extent allowed by law, the right to attend all meetings with the relevant
Tax Authority.

            (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Buyer, Seller, the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall enter into
any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax Contest that
would or that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the other party
for such year or any other year without the written consent of the other party,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer and Seller agree to
cooperate, and Buyer agrees to cause the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries
to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any claim in any Tax
Contest.

            (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
after the First Closing Date Buyer and Seller, at each party's own expense,
shall cooperate and consult with each other in determining whether the Company
Subsidiaries have issued any life insurance policies or annuity contracts that
do not comply with Section 7702 of the Code (or any similar provision of state
or local Law) or are not qualified under Section 72 of the Code (or any similar
provisions of state or local Law), as applicable. In the event Buyer determines
that such policies or contracts have been issued and that it is obligated to
inform any relevant Tax Authority of such non-compliance, Buyer shall first
provide written notification to Seller of its conclusion regarding such
annuities or life insurance policies, with a reasonably detailed explanation of
why such life insurance policies or annuities are not compliant, at least 10
business days prior to Buyer contacting any Tax Authority, and Buyer or Seller
shall thereafter have the right to inform any such relevant Tax Authority as to
the existence of such policies or contracts for the purposes of entering into a
closing agreement with such Tax Authority and such action by Buyer shall not
relieve Seller of any indemnification obligation under this Article X.

            SECTION 10.5. Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Seller and
Buyer will provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of
them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in
respect of Taxes at the expense of the requesting party. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents
relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax Authorities. Seller and Buyer
shall each make its employees available on a basis mutually convenient to both
parties to provide explanations of any documents or information provided
hereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax

                                       67
<PAGE>

Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession relating to Tax matters of the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries
for each taxable period first ending after the First Closing Date and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents
relate, without regard to extensions, or (ii) three years following the due date
(without extension) for such Tax Returns. Prior to disposing of any such records
notice shall be given to the other party providing reasonable terms allowing
such other party to take, at its sole expense, possession of such records.
Subject to Section 4.2(c), any information obtained under this Section 10.5
shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or
other proceeding.

            SECTION 10.6. Conveyance Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision
in this Agreement to the contrary, all stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, registration, filing, sales, use, recording, ad valorem, and
other similar Taxes ("Transfer Taxes") arising out of, or directly attributable
to, the transfers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be borne and
paid equally by Seller and Buyer. Seller and Buyer will use reasonable best
efforts to secure any available exemptions from any such Taxes and to cooperate
in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemptions.

            SECTION 10.7. Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) Buyer and Seller
shall join in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any
identical or similar provisions under state or local law) with respect to the
Section 338(h)(10) Companies (the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"). Buyer and
Seller agree to cooperate in all respects for the purpose of the preparation and
filing of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections (including the preparation of the
Form 8023), and jointly filing effective Section 338(h)(10) Elections on a
timely basis and comply with the rules and regulations applicable to such
Section 338(h)(10) Elections prior to, at the time of and subsequent to the
filing of such Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

            (b) For purposes of making such Section 338(h)(10) Elections, Buyer
shall initially determine the value of the tangible and intangible assets of the
affected entities and shall within 100 days of the First Closing Date provide
Seller with an allocation of Buyer's "adjusted grossed-up basis" in the shares
of the Section 338(h)(10) Companies (within the meaning of the Treasury
Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) to such assets (the "Allocation"). If
on the date that is 150 days following the First Closing Date any adjustments to
Buyer's "adjusted grossed-up basis" in the shares of the Section 338(h)(10)
Companies are necessary, Buyer shall provide Seller with an allocation of the
"adjusted grossed-up basis," so adjusted, amongst the tangible and intangible
assets of the affected entities (the "Adjusted Allocation"). The Allocation and
the Adjusted Allocation, if any, shall be in writing and shall be binding upon
Buyer and Seller for purposes of allocating the "deemed selling price" (within
the meaning of the Treasury Regulations) among the assets of the affected
entities; provided, however, that if Seller disagrees with all or a portion of
the Allocation or the Adjusted Allocation and Buyer and Seller cannot resolve
their disagreement within thirty (30) days after notification thereof by Seller
to Buyer, a nationally recognized independent accounting firm shall be jointly
selected by Seller's and Buyer's accounting firms (the "Independent Accounting
Firm"), to determine whether the Allocation or the Adjusted Allocation is
incorrect and the determination of such Independent Accounting Firm shall be
final and made no later than 15 days prior to the date when any part of

                                       68
<PAGE>

a Section 338(h)(10) Election must be filed with a Governmental Authority. The
Parties shall be bound by the Allocation or the Adjusted Allocation, as
applicable, as adjusted by such Independent Accounting Firm.

            (c) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall file any Tax Return, or take a
position with a Tax Authority, that is inconsistent with the Allocation or the
Adjusted Allocation. The parties agrees to cooperate with each other in
preparing Form 8883 for filing by each and to furnish the other with a copy of
such Form prepared in draft form within a reasonable period before its filing
due date and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the parties agree that all Tax Returns relating to the Section
338(h)(10) Election shall be timely filed in the manner prescribed by Law.

            (d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer, Company and the Company Subsidiaries agree to pay, indemnify
and hold harmless Seller for: (i) the loss or deferral of any Tax credits,
deductions, losses, carry over losses or credits, and any other Tax attribute of
Seller and its Affiliates to the extent, and at such time, that such loss or
deferral results in an actual higher Tax liability to the Seller or any of its
Affiliates and (ii) any Losses, in each case, relating to or resulting from a
breach of any of the covenants set forth on Annex D; provided, however, that the
total amount of the indemnity provided under this Section 10.7(d) shall not
exceed $20 million. For the avoidance of doubt, any matter relating to a breach
under this Section 10.7 and any rights of indemnification pursuant to this
Section 10.7 shall be treated as relating to Taxes for purposes of Section 9.4
of this Agreement.

            (e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
for purposes of Section 338 of the Code and consistent with Section 10.8(g), the
Parties agree to treat the transactions occurring as a result of the Reinsurance
Agreement as taking place after all of the transactions that are deemed to occur
pursuant to the Section 338(h)(10) Elections.

            SECTION 10.8. Miscellaneous. (a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat all
payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including
any payments to the Company or any Company Subsidiary) under this Article X,
under any other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any
misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or covenants as adjustments to the
Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for
purposes hereof except to the extent that the laws of a particular jurisdiction
provide otherwise, in which case such payments shall be made in an amount
sufficient to indemnify the relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

            (b) All payments payable under any tax sharing agreement or
arrangement between Seller and the Company or any Company Subsidiary for any
taxable period ending on or prior to the First Closing Date shall be calculated
on a basis consistent with that used to date and be payable in full at the First
Closing (or a reasonable estimate thereof, with any required adjusting payment
to be payable together with the amount, if any, paid pursuant to an adjustment
to the Final Purchase Price, including interest in accordance with the
provisions thereof), notwithstanding any later time for payment set forth in any
such agreement. Any tax sharing agreement or arrangement between Seller and the
Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be terminated immediately prior to the
First Closing.

                                       69
<PAGE>

            (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary
and except as provided herein, the representations and warranties provided
pursuant to Sections 3.1(i)(v) and 3.1(k) shall terminate at the First Closing;
provided, however, that the representation provided pursuant to Section
3.1(k)(xv) shall survive indefinitely. For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnity
provided in Section 10.1(a)(iii), (iv) and (v) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy at law or in equity for any claim against Seller or any Affiliate thereof
relating to or resulting from an insurance policy not satisfying the
requirements of Section 7702 of the Code or an annuity contract not qualifying
under section 72 of the Code.

            (d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
the obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries and the obligations of Buyer to indemnify and hold
harmless Seller pursuant to this Article X (except with respect to the indemnity
provided for in Section 10.1(a)(iii), (iv) and (v) which obligation shall
survive indefinitely) shall terminate at the close of business on the day
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the liabilities in question.

            (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary (except to the extent Sections 3.1(i)(v), 6.2, 8.1, 9.1(a) and (b) and
9.4 specifically mention Taxes or reference any provision set forth in this
Article X), Section 3.1(k) and 4.19 and Article X of this Agreement shall
exclusively govern all matters relating to Taxes.

            (f) Except with respect to the indemnity provided under Section
10.1(a)(iii), (iv) and (v), for purposes of this Article X any reference to the
First Closing Date or the First Closing shall mean the FFSB Closing Date or the
FFSB Closing, as appropriate, to the extent such provision under this Article X
is addressing a matter regarding FFSB.

            (g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii) (and any other
analogous provision under state or local Law), the transactions occurring and
deemed to occur as a result of the Reinsurance Agreement will be treated by the
parties as having occurred on the day after the First Closing Date.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                   TERMINATION

            SECTION 11.1. Termination of Agreement Prior to the First Closing.
This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the First Closing:

            (a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity that prohibits or restrains any
party to this Agreement from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby,
and such order, injunction or decree shall have become final and nonappealable;

            (b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the First Closing has not
occurred on or prior to the date that is six months following the date of this
Agreement (the "Cut Off Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 11.1(b) shall not

                                       70
<PAGE>

be available to the party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the First Closing
to occur on or before such date;

            (c) by either Seller or Buyer (provided that the terminating party
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained herein), if there has been a material breach on the
part of the other party of any representation, warranty or agreement contained
herein which cannot be or has not been cured within 30 days after written notice
by Buyer to Seller or Seller to Buyer, as the case may be, of such breach;

            (d) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer at any time on or
prior to the First Closing Date; and

            (e) by Buyer pursuant to Section 12.3(d).

            SECTION 11.2. Survival. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 11.1 and the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as
described herein, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect, except for (i) the provisions of Sections 4.2(b) and 4.2(c),
this Section 11.2 and Article XII and (ii) rights and obligations arising from
any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

            SECTION 12.1. Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the purchase and
sale of the Company Shares, the FLIC Shares, the FLAC Shares and the FFSB Shares
is consummated, each party hereto shall pay its own fees and expenses incident
to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (which, in the case of
Seller, shall include such fees and expenses incurred by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary); provided, however, that if either party (the "Terminating
Party") terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(c), then, in addition
to any other remedies that the Terminating Party may have at law or in equity,
the other party shall pay, or reimburse the Terminating Party for, all such
reasonable and documented fees and expenses incurred by the Terminating Party.

            SECTION 12.2. Notices. All notices, requests, claims, demands and
other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
delivered personally, by facsimile (which is confirmed as provided below) or by
overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the parties at the following

            SECTION 12.3. Interpretation. (a) When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section, Exhibit, Annex or Schedule, such reference shall be to a
Section of, or an Exhibit, Annex or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. Nothing in any Disclosure Schedule hereto shall be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made in this Agreement
unless the Schedule sets forth the relevant facts in reasonable detail so as to
make the relevance of such disclosure reasonably apparent; provided, however,
that the inclusion of any fact or item in a Schedule referred to specifically in
the Agreement shall, provided that the existence of such fact or item or its
content is relevant to any other

                                       72
<PAGE>

Schedule and that such fact or item is disclosed in sufficient detail so as to
make such relevance to the other Schedule reasonably apparent, be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to such other Schedule whether or not an explicit
cross-reference appears. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document is not deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty unless the representation
or warranty relates solely to the existence of the document itself.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may cross-reference Sections of the
Schedules and a reference in any Section or subsection of the Schedules to
another Section or subsection of the Schedules shall be deemed to incorporate
the matters so referenced. In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in this Agreement and statements in the Disclosure Schedule, the
statements in this Agreement will control and the statements in the Schedule
will be disregarded. Disclosure of any item in the Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed an admission that such item represents a material item, fact,
exception of fact, event or circumstance or that occurrence or non-occurrence of
any change or effect related to such item would result in a Material Adverse
Effect, Company Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be. The Disclosure Schedule is qualified in its entirety by reference
to the specific provisions of the Agreement, and is not intended to constitute,
and shall not be construed as constituting, representations or warranties of
Seller or Buyer except as and to the extent set forth in this Agreement. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement and the Disclosure
Schedule are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, includes any Schedule or Exhibit hereto), they shall be deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the singular is used in
this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes any Schedule or
Exhibit hereto), the same shall include the plural, and whenever the plural is
used herein, the same shall include the singular, where appropriate.

            (b) No provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in favor of,
or against, either party hereto by reason of the extent to which any such party
or its counsel participated in the drafting thereof or by reason of the extent
to which any such provision is inconsistent with any prior draft hereof or
thereof.

            (c) If more than one provision contained in this Agreement relates
to the same subject matter, then each such provision shall apply thereto with
equal force and effect, and the more specific provision shall not be presumed or
deemed to prevail over, or exclude the application of, the more general
provision.

            (d) No less than five Business Days prior to the First Closing Date,
Seller may provide Buyer a revised Disclosure Schedule in order to reflect
changes resulting solely from events that occur after the date hereof which are
not caused by the intentional misconduct or reckless acts of Seller. Within five
Business Days following the delivery of such revised Disclosure Schedule, Buyer
may elect to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller if the matters
reflected in any such change or changes would, individually or in the aggregate,
cause the condition to the obligation of Buyer set forth in Section 6.2(a) not
to be satisfied if such change or changes were not set forth in Seller's
Disclosure Schedule. In the event that Buyer does not make such election by such
date, the Disclosure Schedule as so revised shall

                                       73
<PAGE>

constitute Seller's Disclosure Schedule for all purposes of this Agreement,
including, without limitation, Section 9.1(a).

            SECTION 12.4. Entire Agreement; No Other Representations;
Third-Party Beneficiaries. (a) This Agreement (including the Transaction
Documents and all exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto), the Disclosure
Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations and warranties,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement.

            (b) Buyer acknowledges that neither Seller nor any Affiliate nor any
officer, director, employee, representative or agent of any of them or any
Affiliate makes or has made any representation or warranty, express or implied,
or any other inducement or promise to Buyer other than in this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents.

            (c) Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms and provisions of
this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the parties hereto, and
their respective successors and assigns, and it is not the intention of the
parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person.

            SECTION 12.5. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless
of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

            SECTION 12.6. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of any party to this Agreement shall be
assigned, by operation of law or otherwise by such party without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment that is not
consented to in writing shall be null and void; provided, however, that Buyer
may assign this Agreement and any or all rights or obligations hereunder to (i)
any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Buyer, provided that any such assignment is not
materially adverse to Seller, (ii) any lender or financial guarantor for the
purpose of collateral security in connection with the Securitization Financing,
or any refinancing thereof or, (iii) following the First Closing Date, any
Person to which Buyer or any of its Affiliates proposes to sell all or
substantially all of the assets relating to the business of the Company. Upon
any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Buyer shall
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires. Subject
to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any assignment by either party as
permitted under this Section 12.6 shall not relieve the assignor from its
obligations under this Agreement.

            SECTION 12.7. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or
any state court that in either case is located in the City of Indianapolis (any
such federal or state court, an "Indiana Court"), in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law

                                       74
<PAGE>

or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Indiana Court in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction or venue by motion or other request for leave from any
such Indiana Court.

            SECTION 12.8. Severability; Amendments; Waiver. (a) Whenever
possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or
rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will
not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any
provision had never been contained herein.

            (b) This Agreement may be amended, superseded, cancelled, renewed or
extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a written instrument
signed by each of the parties or, in the case of a waiver, by the party waiving
compliance.

            (c) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver
on the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.

            SECTION 12.9. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties. Each party hereto is
entitled to rely on a facsimile signature of the other party as an original.

            SECTION 12.10. Non-recourse. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of Seller or Buyer shall have any liability for any

                                     ANNEX A
            AGREED PROCEDURES FOR CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED BOOK VALUE

ADJUSTED BOOK VALUE means, in the aggregate, the following items, each as of the
specified date: (i) the Capital and Surplus of FLIC (which includes the carrying
value of FLAC and ANLIC); minus (ii) the sum of the Admitted Net Deferred Tax
Assets of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries; plus (iii) the sum of the Asset
Valuation Reserves held by each of the Insurance Subsidiaries; minus (iv) the
Unamortized Statutory Goodwill balance; plus (v) an amount (which may be
negative) equal to the tax effected difference between the Fair Market Value and
statutory admitted value of Surplus Assets of the Insurance Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis.

CAPITAL AND SURPLUS means line 38, column 1 in the "Liabilities, Surplus and
Other Funds" section of the balance sheet in the applicable statutory financial
statements (page 3) of the Insurance Subsidiaries, or, if the line number is
changed in such statutory financial statements, on the line that supersedes line
38 and reflects capital and surplus.

ADMITTED NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET means line 15.2, column 3 in the "Assets"
Section of the balance sheet in the applicable statutory financial statements
(page 2) of the Insurance Subsidiaries, or, if the line number is changed in
such statutory financial statements, on the line that supersedes line 15.2 and
reflects admitted net deferred tax assets.

ASSET VALUATION RESERVE means line 24.1, column 1 in the "Liabilities, Surplus
and Other Funds" section of the balance sheet in the applicable statutory
financial statements of the Insurance Subsidiaries, or, if the line number is
changed in such statutory financial statements, on the line that supersedes line
24.1 and reflects Asset Valuation Reserve.

UNAMORTIZED STATUTORY GOODWILL means the portion of line 2.2, column 3 in the
"Assets" section of the balance sheet in the applicable statutory financial
statements of the Insurance Subsidiaries that represents unamortized statutory
goodwill related to FLIC's purchase of ANLIC, or, if the line number is changed
in such statutory financial statements, the portion of the line that supersedes
line 2.2 and reflects unamortized statutory goodwill.

FAIR MARKET VALUE shall be determined as follows:

            Real Estate

            The fair market value of Real Estate shall be the appraised value
            determined by a qualified appraiser acceptable to both Buyer and
            Seller.

            Mortgage Loans on Real Estate

            The fair market value of mortgage loans on real estate should be
            determined by adding the present value of future cash flows. The
            discount rate utilized should be the current risk adjusted interest
            rate for a loan of the same type, size, location and risk profile.
            In the computation of the market values of its mortgages,
            Forethought will obtain the current risk adjusted interest rate from
            the originator of the mortgage (Key Bank or David L. Babson). Should
            Buyer dispute the risk adjusted interest rate of any loan, the
            dispute will be resolved by taking the middle rate of three rates,
            obtained by three independent

                                      A-1

<PAGE>

            mortgage originators, with one such originator selected by Seller,
            one by Buyer, and one selected by the two other originators.

            Investments other than Real Estate and Mortgage Loans on Real Estate

            For other investments other than real estate and mortgage loans on
            real estate, Forethought will obtain fair market values from its
            independent investment advisors (David L. Babson or Conning) which
            shall not take into account "investment income due and accrued." If
            Buyer disputes a market value on any such asset, then the Fair
            Market Value shall be the middle value of three values determined by
            three independent brokers, with one such broker selected by Seller,
            one by Buyer and one selected by the two other brokers.

SURPLUS ASSETS means assets not supporting liabilities determined using the
procedures set forth below. All assets shall be recorded according to Statutory
Accounting Principles.

            Procedure for Determining Surplus Assets

            Surplus Assets should be determined as follows:

                  A. Calculate liabilities ("Backed Liabilities") that must be
            backed by assets. The Backed Liabilities are total statutory
            liabilities reported by FLIC, FLAC and ANLIC as would be reported on
            page 3, line 26 reduced by:

                  1.    the Asset Valuation Reserve held by FLIC, FLAC and ANLIC
                        as would be reported on page 3, line 24.1, column 1;

                  2.    Contract loans held by FLIC, FLAC and ANLIC as would be
                        reported on page 2, line 6, column 3; and

                  3.    Deferred Premiums held by FLIC, FLAC and ANLIC as would
                        be reported on page 2, line 12.2, column 3.

                  B. Select assets from the following asset categories held by
            FLIC, FLAC and ANLIC to back the liabilities. The asset categories
            should be selected in the following order:

                  1.    Investment income due and accrued

                  2.    Short term investments and cash

                  3.    Bonds with an NAIC designation of 1

                  4.    Bonds with an NAIC designation of 2

                  5.    Bonds with an NAIC designation of 3

                  6.    Bonds with an NAIC designation of 4

                  7.    Bonds with an NAIC designation of 5

                  8.    Bonds with an NAIC designation of 6

                            (collectively, the "Included Asset Categories").

                  C. Continue to include all assets in an asset category until
            the cumulative statutory admitted value of all such assets in the
            Included Asset Categories equals or exceeds the Backed Liabilities.

                                      A-2

<PAGE>

            The computation of statutory admitted values for assets and
      statutory liabilities must be in accordance with Statutory Accounting
      Principles. The Accounting and Actuarial principles, methods and
      assumptions utilized must be consistent with those utilized by FLIC, FLAC
      and ANLIC in their Statutory filings, dated September 30, 2003. Except as
      otherwise specified herein, line number and page number references are to
      the Statutory filings of FLIC, FLAC and ANLIC, dated September 30, 2003.

      Procedure for calculating the difference between the Fair Market Value and
      Statutory Admitted Value of Surplus Assets

            The difference between the Fair Market Value and Statutory Admitted
      Value of Surplus Assets is comprised of the sum of the following two
      components:

            1.    Allocation of excess gains/losses on assets backing
                  liabilities calculated as follows:

                  a.    For whichever category of assets (listed above) that,
                        when added to the prior categories causes the cumulative
                        statutory admitted value of assets in included
                        categories to exceed the Backed Liabilities, compute the
                        ratio of excess assets as follows: One (1) minus ((i)
                        Statutory Admitted Value of assets in the last included
                        asset category necessary to equal the Backed Liabilities
                        divided by (ii) the Statutory Admitted Value of all
                        assets in the last included asset category). The
                        components (in (i) and (ii) herein) are as calculated in
                        the Procedure for Determining Surplus Assets;

                  b.    Compute the difference between the Fair Market Value and
                        Statutory Admitted Value on all assets in the last
                        included asset category.;

                  c.    Multiply the difference determined in part b. by the
                        amount calculated in part a.

            2.    The difference between the Statutory Admitted Value and Fair
                  Market Value of the invested assets not in the Included Asset
                  Categories.

      The sum of 1 and 2 should be multiplied by 0.65 to determine the
      tax-effected difference between the Fair Market Value and the Statutory
      Admitted Value of Surplus Assets.

                                      A-3

                                     ANNEX B
                         SELLER PRE-CLOSING TRANSACTIONS

Seller shall cause the following transactions to be effected prior to the First
Closing in the order set forth below:

1.    FLIC declares and pays to the Company a dividend of all of the FLAC
      Shares.

2.    FLIC redeems 1,000 shares of its common stock from the Company for an
aggregate redemption price of cash in the amount of $168,000,000 (or such other
amount that Buyer notifies Seller of in writing at least five Business Days
prior to the First Closing Date) (the "Redemption Price"), which is to be paid
to the Company at the time such redemption is effected.

3.    The Company pays the Redemption Price in cash to FLAC as a contribution of
capital.

                                      B-1

                                     ANNEX C
                         BUYER PRE-CLOSING TRANSACTIONS

            The following transactions are listed in the chronological order in
which the transactions must occur:

            1. Initially, a purchaser (the "Initial Purchaser") enters into a
binding written agreement with a third party (the "Second Purchaser") to sell to
the Second Purchaser, on the day following the First Closing Date, all of the
Buyer's Class B non-voting common stock issued to the Initial Purchaser by Buyer
for $2 million.

            2. The Initial Purchaser will purchase directly from Buyer, in
exchange for $2 million in cash, all of Buyer's Class B non-voting common stock
immediately prior to the First Closing. The cash used by the Initial Purchaser
to purchase Buyer's Class B non-voting common stock must not be borrowed from or
be paid directly or indirectly by the Second Purchaser or any party related to
the Second Purchaser.

            3. In accordance with the terms of the binding agreement referenced
above in 1., on the day following the First Closing Date, the Second Purchaser
will acquire from the Initial Purchaser all of the Class B non-voting common
stock issued to the Initial Purchaser by Buyer. The consideration used by the
Second Purchaser to acquire such stock should not be borrowed from or be paid
directly or indirectly by the Initial Purchaser or any party related to the
Initial Purchaser.

            4. The stock purchase agreement between Buyer and the Initial
Purchaser and the stock purchase agreement between the Initial Purchaser and the
Second Purchaser will contain representation and warranties made by: (w) the
Initial Purchaser, that the Initial Purchaser has not obtained the funds needed
to acquired the Class B non-voting stock from the Second Purchaser, Buyer or any
party related to the Second Purchaser or Buyer, (x) the Second Purchaser, that
the Second Purchaser has not obtained the funds needed to purchase the Class B
non-voting common stock from Buyer, the Initial Purchaser or any party related
to Buyer or the Initial Purchaser; (y) the Second Purchaser, that the Second
Purchaser has no intent to sell or otherwise transfer the Class B non-voting
common stock to any of the other initial buyers of Initial Buyer Common Shares
(as determined as of the First Closing Date, the "Initial Investors") or Buyer
or any party related to such Initial Investors or Buyer; and (z) the Initial
Purchaser and the Second Purchaser that neither the Initial Purchaser nor the
Second Purchaser, will take any position with respect to any Tax audit,
controversy or claim, financial statement, public filing, Tax Return,
administrative filing, or any other filing that is not consistent with the
Second Purchaser being the bona fide purchaser and owner of the Class B
non-voting common stock.

            For purposes of Annex C of this Agreement a party will be treated as
a party related to either the Initial Purchaser, the Second Purchaser, the Buyer
or the Initial Investors (the "Pre-Closing Transaction Parties") if such party
is: (i) a Person that is either "controlled" or in "control" (as defined
pursuant to Section 1.482-(1)(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) of any
Pre-Closing Transaction Party, (ii) a "controlled taxpayer" with respect to any
Pre-Closing Transaction Party as that term is defined pursuant to Section
1.482-1(i)(5) of the Treasury

Transaction Party (as defined pursuant to Section 1.482-1(i)(6) of the Treasury
Regulations).

              COVENANTS CONCERNING THE SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION

            1. Buyer, and to the extent relevant any successor to Buyer, the
Company, any Company Subsidiary, the initial holders of the Initial Buyer Common
Shares (the "Initial Holders") and the holder of the Class B non-voting common

extent required by a final determination of applicable Law, (x) not take any
position on any financial statement, public filing, Tax Return, administrative
filing, or any other filing or any position whether written or oral with any
Governmental Entity or judicial or administrative body, agency or office, in
each case, that is inconsistent with: (a) treating the acquisition of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries being treated as a deemed sale of assets
for income tax purposes pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or any
similar applicable provision of state or local law, (b) treating the Seller's
Note as debt, (c) treating Buyer's Class B stock as non-voting stock for federal
income tax purposes, or (d) treating the transaction as an exchange that would
not be subject to Section 351 of the Code; and

            2. Buyer, Company or any Company Subsidiary, and any successors
thereto, will not redeem the Initial Buyer Common Shares for a period of 5 years
after the First Closing Date or redeem the Class B non-voting common stock for a
period of 3 years after the First Closing Date.

            For purposes of Annex D of this Agreement, a party will be treated
as a party related to either the Buyer, the Company, a Company Subsidiary, the
Initial Investors, or the holder of Class B non-voting common stock
(collectively the "338(h)(10) Parties" and each individually a "338(h)(10)
Party") if such party is: (i) a Person that is either "controlled" or in
"control" (as defined pursuant to Section 1.482-(1)(i)(4) of the Treasury
Regulations) of any 338(h)(10) Party, (ii) a "controlled taxpayer" with respect
to any 338(h)(10) Party as that term is defined pursuant to Section
1.482-1(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulation, or (iii) is part of the same
controlled group as any 338(h)(10) Party (as defined pursuant to Section
1.482-1(i)(6) of the Treasury Regulations).
