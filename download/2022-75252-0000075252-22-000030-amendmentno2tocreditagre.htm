The Borrowers shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account a fronting fee (a &#8220;Fronting Fee&#8221;) with respect to each Letter of Credit issued by it equal to 0.125% per annum of the Dollar Equivalent of the daily maximum amount then available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in the United States.  If, for any reason, the Borrowers are prohibited by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in Euro, the Borrowers shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Euro payment amount.  The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender&#8217;s Applicable Lending Office.  All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m. (or 3:00 p.m. London time in the case of payments in Euro) shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. (b) If any payment to be made by the Borrowers shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be; provided that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Eurocurrency RateTerm SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans to be made in the next succeeding calendar month, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. (c) Unless the Borrowers or any Lender has notified the Administrative Agent, prior to the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Administrative Agent hereunder, that the Borrowers or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrowers or such Lender, as the case may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the Person entitled thereto.
