Administrative Agent at any time and from time to time, including, without
limitation, following the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Lender
(including each of the Swing Line Lenders) absolutely and unconditionally agrees
to refund Swing Loans held by the Swing Line Lenders by advancing its Primary
Percentage Share thereof to the Lead Administrative Agent for disbursement to
the Swing Line Lenders pro rata, in accordance with their respective Swing Line
Percentage Shares. Such fundings shall be made no later than 12:00 noon (Los
Angeles time) on the date request therefor is made if such request is made on or
before 11:00 a.m. (Los Angeles time) on such date, and no later than 12:00 noon
(Los Angeles time) on the next succeeding Business Day if request therefor is
made after 11:00 a.m. (Los Angeles time). Advances made by the Lenders hereunder
for the purpose of refunding Swing Loans shall, for all purposes of the Credit
Documents: (i) constitute Primary Loans to the extent of such Lender&#146;s
Primary Percentage Share thereof, and (ii) be advanced as Federal Funds Rate

their respective Primary Percentage Shares for the purpose of refunding Swing
Loans as required hereunder, then each of the Lenders (including each of the
Swing Line Lenders) absolutely and unconditionally agrees to purchase and take
from the Swing Line Lenders on demand an undivided participation interest in
Swing Loans outstanding in an amount equal to their respective Primary
Percentage Shares of such Swing Loans. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein, in no event shall any Lender be required to advance its Primary
Percentage Share of any Swing Loan or to purchase any undivided participation
interest in any Swing Loan: <U>a</U>. unless such Swing Loan was initially made
in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement (as such requirements may
be amended or waived from time to time as permitted hereunder) or <U>b</U>. if
upon such advance or purchase the aggregate dollar amount of Primary Loans,
Swing Loans, and Within Commitment Negotiated Loans held by such Lender would

toward funding the requested Swing Loans no later than 1:00 p.m. (Los Angeles
time) on such date, the Company expressly acknowledging and agreeing that there
is no assurance that any such funding can be provided. Said Loan Request,

Interest Rate Election and Payoff Notice requesting Primary Loans and only one

thereto is not less than $5,000,000.00, and any request for Swing Loans shall be
in an amount not less than $1,000,000.00. On each Business Day on which a Loan
Request, Interest Rate Election and Payoff Notice is delivered to the Lead
Administrative Agent, the Lead Administrative Agent shall notify the applicable
Lenders (which notification may be telephonic and, if telephonic, shall be
promptly confirmed in writing) no later than 11:00&#160;a.m. (Los Angeles time)

Notice delivered on the proposed conversion date; provided, however, that any
conversion of Eurodollar Loans to Federal Funds Rate Loans may only be made on
the last day of the applicable Eurodollar Interest Period. The Company may elect
from time to time to convert Federal Funds Rate Loans to Eurodollar Loans by
giving the Lead Administrative Agent at least three Eurodollar Business
Days&#146; prior irrevocable notice of such election by delivery of a duly
executed Loan Request, Interest Rate Election and Payoff Notice.<BR><BR>

(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Upon receipt of any Loan Request, Interest Rate Election and Payoff Notice, the Lead
Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify each of the Lenders thereof. No Primary Loan shall
be funded as a Eurodollar Loan and no outstanding Federal Funds Rate Loan shall
be converted into a Eurodollar Loan if an Event of Default or Potential Default
has occurred and is continuing on the day occurring two Business Days prior to
the date of the funding or conversion requested by the Company or on the
proposed funding or conversion date.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Any Eurodollar Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the Interest Period
applicable

at least three Eurodollar Business Days&#146; prior irrevocable notice of such
election as set forth on a duly executed Loan Request, Interest Rate Election
and Payoff Notice; provided, however, that no Eurodollar Loan may be continued
as such when any Event of Default or Potential Default has occurred and is
continuing, but shall be automatically converted to an Federal Funds Rate Loan
on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto. The Lead
Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders and the Company promptly that such
automatic conversion will occur. If the Company shall fail to give notice as
provided above, the Company shall be deemed to have elected to convert the
affected Eurodollar Loan to an Federal Funds Rate Loan on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto.<BR><BR>

(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The Lead Administrative Agent shall give prompt written notice (or notice by telephone
         immediately confirmed in writing) to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Lead
         Administrative Agent.<BR><BR>

at least two Eurodollar Business Days prior to, as the case may be, the

elected to have continued as a Eurodollar Loan, or (4)&#160;the Company shall
fail to make any payment of principal or interest on any Loan when due, then the
Company shall immediately pay to each of the affected Lenders, through the Lead
Administrative Agent, an additional amount compensating such Lender for all
losses, costs and expenses incurred by such Lender in connection therewith,
including, without limitation, such as may arise out of the re-employment of
funds obtained by such Lender or from fees payable to terminate the deposits
from which such funds were obtained, such losses, costs and expenses and the

(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     All payments made by the Company, the Lead Administrative Agent and the Lenders on
account
of the Obligations shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now
or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any
Governmental Authority, excluding, in the case of a Lender, net income taxes and
franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of net income taxes), imposed on such Lender,
as the case may be, as a result of a present or former connection between the
jurisdiction of the government or taxing authority imposing such tax, or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, and such Lender
(other than a connection arising solely from such Lender having executed,
delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced,
the Credit Documents) (all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
charges, fees, deductions and withholdings being hereinafter called
&#147;Taxes&#148;). If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to any Lender under the Credit Documents, the amounts so payable by the
Company to the Lead Administrative Agent for the benefit of such Lender shall be
increased to the extent necessary to yield to such Lender (after payment of all
Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable thereunder at the rates or in
the amounts specified in the Credit Documents. Whenever any Taxes are payable by
the Company or on behalf of the Company, the Company shall pay such Taxes to the
appropriate taxing authority when due, and as promptly as possible thereafter
the Company shall send to the Lead Administrative Agent for its own account or
for the account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an
original official receipt received by the Company showing payment thereof. If
the Company fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority
or fails to remit to the Lead Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, the Company shall indemnify the Lead
Administrative Agent and such Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by the Lead Administrative Agent and such
Lender as a result of any such failure. The agreements in this subsection shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the payment of all other
Obligations. Each Lender by executing this Agreement represents and warrants to
the Company and the Lead Administrative Agent that at the date of this Agreement
no Taxes are imposed upon such Lender which would result in increased liability
of the Company to such Lender pursuant to this Paragraph&#160;4(i)(1).<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Each Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of
America
or a state thereof (each a &#147;Non-U.S. Lender&#148;) agrees that it will, on
or before the Effective Date or the effective date of any Additional Lender
Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender and on the request of the Lead
Administrative Agent or the Company, (i) deliver to each of the Company and the
Lead Administrative Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or W-8BEN or any successor form, certifying in
either case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income
taxes, and (ii) deliver to each of the Company and the Lead Administrative Agent
a United States Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as the case may be,
and certify that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax. Each Non-U.S. Lender further undertakes to deliver to each of
the Company and the Lead Administrative Agent (x) renewals or additional copies
of such form (or any successor form) on or before the date that such form
expires or becomes obsolete, and (y) after the occurrence of any event requiring
a change in the most recent forms so delivered by it, such additional forms or
amendments thereto as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the Lead
Administrative Agent. All forms or amendments described in the preceding
sentence shall certify that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United States federal
income taxes, <I>unless </I> an event (including without limitation any change
in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred after the relevant date and prior to
the date on which any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders
all such forms inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly
completing and delivering any such form or amendment with respect to it and such
Lender advises the Company and the Lead Administrative Agent that it is not
capable of receiving payments without any deduction or withholding of United
States federal income tax.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     For any period during which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the
Company
with an appropriate form pursuant to subparagraph (2) above (unless such failure
is due to a change after the relevant date in treaty, law or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority, occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
required to be provided), such Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to
indemnification under this Paragraph 4(i) with respect to Taxes; provided that,
should a Non-U.S. Lender which is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced
rate of withholding tax become subject to Taxes because of its failure to
deliver a form required under subparagraph (2) above, the Company shall take (at
the expense of the Non-U.S. Lender) such steps as such Non-U.S. Lender shall
reasonably request to assist such Non-U.S. Lender to recover such Taxes.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
tax
with respect to payments under this Agreement or any Note pursuant to the law of
any relevant jurisdiction or any treaty shall deliver to the Company (with a
copy to the Lead Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by
applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at
a reduced rate.<BR><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental authority of
the
United States or any other country or any political subdivision thereof asserts
a claim that the Lead Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from
amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the appropriate form
was not delivered or properly completed, because such Lender failed to notify
the Lead Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered its
exemption from withholding ineffective, or for any other reason), such Lender
shall indemnify the Lead Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly or indirectly, by the Lead Administrative Agent as tax, withholding
therefor, or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including taxes
imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable to the Lead Administrative Agent
under this subparagraph, together with all costs and expenses related thereto
(including attorneys fees and time charges of attorneys for the Lead
Administrative Agent, which attorneys may be employees of the Lead
Administrative Agent). The obligations of the Lenders under this Paragraph 4(i)

from time to time outstanding held by such Buy-Down Lender (the Loans held by
such Buy-Down Lender which are subject to a Buy-Down Agreement being referred to
herein as &#147;Buy-Down Rate Loans&#148;), and that, pursuant to said Buy-Down
Agreement, the interest rate otherwise applicable to the Buy-Down Rate Loans
during any interest calculation period shall be reduced to the Buy-Down Rate and
the interest otherwise payable by the Company to such Buy-Down Lender during
such interest calculation period shall be reduced accordingly. Interest payable
to such Buy-Down Lender with respect to Buy-Down Rate Loans shall be billed as
provided in Paragraph 5(d) below. In no event shall the Lead Administrative
Agent have any obligation or duty to verify the amount of any Buy-Down Deposits
supporting the pricing of Buy-Down Rate Loans held by any Buy-Down Lender or the
amount of any interest billing with respect thereto. Any deficiency fees payable
to such Buy-Down Lender by the Company under the applicable Buy-Down Agreement
shall be billed by such Buy-Down Lender to the Company directly. Any Buy-Down
Lender may elect not to make demand for the payment of deficiency fees accruing
in respect of Buy-Down Deposits from time to time and it is expressly agreed and
understood that: (1) any such deficiency fee shall not, by reason of such
failure of such Buy-Down Lender or otherwise, be deemed to have been waived by
such Buy-Down Lender (except as such waiver is expressly acknowledged in writing
by such Buy-Down Lender from time to time), and (2) all deficiency fees accrued
and unpaid hereunder and not so expressly waived, whether or not previously
declared due and owing by any such Buy-Down Lender, shall automatically be due

Lender has advanced its Swing Line Percentage Share of Swing Loans required to
be funded by such Lender hereunder on the funding date therefor and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have so made
such amounts available, such Lender and the Company jointly and severally agree
to repay to the Lead Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to the Company until the date such amount is repaid to the Lead
Administrative Agent, at, in the case of the Company, the interest rate
applicable at the time to the subject Loan and, in the case of the Lenders, the
Federal Funds Effective Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Lead
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Lender&#146;s Primary Percentage Share or Swing Line Percentage
Share, as applicable, of the subject Loan, as applicable for all purposes of the
Credit Documents as of the date such Loan was made. Nothing contained herein

the agent for such Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of the Credit Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such
duties as are expressly delegated to such Agent by the terms of the Credit
Documents, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in the Credit Documents,

agents, counsel,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (1)&#160;liable to any Lender, any
other Agent, the holder of any CPN, the Parent, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or such Person
under or in connection with the Credit Documents (except for its or such

(i)&#160;any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the
Parent, the Company, any of their Subsidiaries, or any officer thereof contained
in the Credit Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other
document referred to or provided for in, or received by such Agent under or in
connection with, the Credit Documents (except such as are prepared by such Agent
and, then, only to the extent such Agent is responsible for verification of the
accuracy and completeness of the information contained therein or the facts upon
which such information is based as expressly provided herein) or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability, collectability or
sufficiency of the Credit Documents or for any failure of the Parent, the
Company, or any Subsidiary Guarantor to perform its obligations thereunder or
(ii)&#160;assuring compliance of the Credit Documents and/or the transactions
contemplated by the Credit Documents with any law or regulation binding upon
such Person, it being expressly acknowledged, agreed and understood that each
such Person has obtained independent advice satisfactory to it in all such
regards. No Agent shall be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained
in, or conditions of, the Credit Documents (other than agreements required to be
complied with by such Agent thereunder and subject to the standards of care set
forth herein with respect thereto) or to inspect the properties, books or
records of the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary Guarantor. Each Agent
shall be entitled to refrain from exercising any discretionary powers or actions
under this Agreement or any other Credit Document until it shall have received
the prior written consent of one hundred percent (100%) of the Lenders to such
action. </FONT></P>

12(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <U>Reliance by Agent</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any note, writing,
resolution, notice, consent, certification, affidavit, letter, cablegram,
telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other
document or conversation reasonably believed by it to be genuine and correct and
to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation, counsel
to the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary Guarantor), independent
accountants and other experts selected by such Agent. The Lead Administrative
Agent may deem and treat each Lender designated on the current Commitment
Schedule as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of the Credit Documents unless a
written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer of such Lender&#146;s
interests hereunder and thereunder as permitted pursuant to Paragraph 14 below
shall have been filed with the Lead Administrative Agent. Each Agent shall be
fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under the Credit
Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the
Majority Lenders (or all Lenders, as required under the Credit Documents) or it
shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or
continuing to take any action (other than liability and/or expense arising out
of such Agent&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct). Each Agent shall
in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
the Credit Documents in accordance with a request of the Majority Lenders (or
all Lenders, if applicable) absent gross negligence and willful misconduct on
the part of such Agent in the method in which it acts or refrains from acting in
accordance therewith, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders. </FONT></P>

12(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <U>Notice of Default; Agreement to Advance</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of any Event
of Default or Potential Default unless such Agent has received notice from a
Lender or the Company referring to the Credit Documents, describing such Event
of Default or Potential Default and stating that such notice is a &#147;notice
of default&#148;. In the event that any Agent receives such a notice, such Agent
shall give notice thereof to the Lenders and the other Agents. </FONT></P>

12(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <U>Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders</U>.  Each Lender expressly acknowledges that no Agent nor any
of its respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made any
representations or warranties to it and that no act by such Agent hereafter
taken, including any review of the affairs of the Parent, the Company, or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by such Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to each Agent that
it has, independently and without reliance upon such Agent or any other Lender
or their respective counsel, and based on such documents and information as it
has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary Guarantor and
made its own decision to extend credit hereunder and enter into this Agreement.
Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without reliance
upon any Agent or any other Lender or their respective counsel, and based on
such documents, information and legal advice (including, without limitation,
advice of regulatory counsel to it) as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in entering
into the Credit Documents and taking or not taking action thereunder, and to
make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary Guarantor. Except
for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be furnished to
the Lenders by an Agent hereunder, such Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender with any legal advice or credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary
Guarantor which may come into the possession of such Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

such ratably in accordance
with their Primary Percentage Shares to the extent required by the Company
pursuant to Paragraph 9(m) above if any Agent is not reimbursed by the Company
hereunder and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so. To the
extent indemnification payments made by the Lenders pursuant to this
Paragraph&#160;12(g) are subsequently recovered by any Agent from, or for the
account of, the Company, such Agent will promptly refund such previously paid
indemnity payments to the Lenders. The indemnification obligations of the
Lenders under this Paragraph&#160;12(g) shall survive termination of this
Agreement and payment in full of the Obligations.

from and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Parent, the Company, or any Subsidiary
Guarantor as though such Agent were not an Agent hereunder. With respect to such
loans made or renewed by them and any note issued to them hereunder, each Agent
shall have the same rights and powers under the Credit Documents as any Lender
thereunder and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the
terms &#147;Lender&#148; and &#147;Lenders&#148; shall include Agents in their
individual capacities.

12(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <U>Successor Agents</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Any Agent may resign as such under the Credit Documents upon ninety (90) days'
prior written notice to the
Lenders and the Company and the Lead Administrative Agent shall resign in the
event its Maximum Commitment shall be less than $25,000,000.00. In addition, in
the event any Agent fails to perform its obligations under the Credit Documents
in any material manner and fails to correct its performance within thirty (30)
days of written notice of such failure of performance given by not less than the
Majority Lenders, then such Agent may be removed upon thirty (30) days notice
given by not less than the Majority Lenders. If an Agent shall resign or be so
removed, then, on or before the effective date of such resignation or removal,
the Majority Lenders shall appoint a successor agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company or, if the Majority Lenders are unable to agree on the appointment
of a successor agent, such Agent shall appoint a successor agent for the
Lenders, which successor agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company,
whereupon such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of
such Agent, and the term &#147;Documentation Agent,&#148; &#147;Syndication
Agent,&#148; &#147;Lead Administrative Agent,&#148; &#147;Co-Administrative
Agent,&#148; &#147;Arranger&#148;, or &#147;Co-Arranger,&#148; as applicable,
shall mean such successor agent effective upon its appointment, and the former
Agent&#146;s rights, powers and duties shall be terminated without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to
this Agreement or any of the other Credit Documents or successors thereto. After
any Agent&#146;s resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this
Paragraph&#160;12 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was Agent under the Credit Documents. </FONT></P>

12(j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    <U>Sharing of Set-Offs</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  If following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default any Lender (a
&#147;benefited Lender&#148;) shall at any time receive any payment of all or
part of the Obligations held by it or receive any collateral in respect thereof
(whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off or otherwise) in a greater
proportion than any such payment to and collateral received by any other Lender,
if any, in respect of such other Lender&#146;s portion of the Obligations, or
interest thereon, such benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other
Lenders such portion of each such other Lender&#146;s Obligations, or shall
provide such other Lenders with the benefits of such collateral, or the proceeds
thereof, as shall be necessary to cause such benefited Lender to share the
excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with each of
the Lenders in accordance with their respective Primary Percentage Shares;
provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits
is thereafter recovered from such benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery but without interest. The Company agrees that each Lender so purchasing
a portion of another Lender&#146;s Obligations may exercise all rights of
payment (including, without limitation, rights of set-off) with respect to such
portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion. </FONT></P>

and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, Guarantor hereby agrees as follows:
</FONT></P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>AGREEMENT</FONT></H1>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the payment when due, upon maturity, acceleration or
otherwise, of the Obligations, whether heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether voluntary or involuntary and
however arising, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such Obligations are
from time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter increased or incurred, whether Borrower may be liable individually or
jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such Obligations may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations,
and whether or not such Obligations may be or hereafter become otherwise invalid or unenforceable.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the payment of the Obligations whether or not due or payable by
Borrower upon: (a) the dissolution, insolvency or business failure of, or any assignment for the benefit of creditors by, or
commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceedings by or against, Borrower or
Guarantor, or (b) the appointment of a receiver for, or the attachment, restraint of or making or levying of any order of court or
legal process affecting, the property of Borrower or Guarantor, and unconditionally promises to pay such Obligations to the Lead
Administrative Agent for the benefit of Lenders, or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       The liability of Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the
Obligations, whether executed by Guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of Guarantor hereunder is not affected or
impaired by (a) any direction of application of payment by Borrower or by any other party, or (b) any other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of Guarantor or of any other party as to the Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other
guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any revocation or release of any obligations of any other guarantor of the Obligations, or (e) any
dissolution, termination or increase, decrease or change in personnel of Guarantor, or (f) any payment made to Lenders or Lead
Administrative Agent on the Obligations which any of such Persons repay to Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or
modification of Guarantor's obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The obligations of Guarantor hereunder are independent of the Obligations of Borrower, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether or not action is brought against Borrower and whether or
not Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.  Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof.  Any payment by Borrower or other circumstance
which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to Guarantor.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
                  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      All payments made by Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and free
and clear of and without deductions for any present or future taxes, fees, withholdings or conditions of any nature ("Taxes").
Guarantor shall pay any such Taxes, including Taxes on any amounts so paid, and will promptly furnish each Lender with copies of any
tax receipts or such other evidence of payment as Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent may require.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor authorizes Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent (whether or not after termination of this Guaranty),
without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing
its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment of, or otherwise change the terms of, Obligations or any part thereof, including increase or decrease of the rate of interest
thereon; (b) take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any
such security; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent in
their discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, Borrower or other obligors.
Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent may without notice to or the further consent of Borrower or Guarantor assign this Guaranty in
whole or in part to any person acquiring an interest in the Obligations.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       It is not necessary for Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent to inquire into the capacity or power of Borrower or
the officers acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of
such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor waives any right to require Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent to (a) proceed against Borrower or any
other party; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Lenders' power
whatsoever.  Guarantor waives any personal defense based on or arising out of any personal defense of Borrower other than payment in
full of the Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of Borrower, or the
invalidity or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of Borrower other than payment in full of the Obligations.  Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent may, at their election,
exercise any right or remedy Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent may have against Borrower, or any security, without affecting or
impairing in any way the liability of Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid.  Guarantor waives any
defense arising out of any such election, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of Guarantor against Borrower or any security.  Guarantor hereby waives any claim or other
rights which Guarantor may now have or may hereafter acquire against the Borrower or any other guarantor of all or any of the
Obligations that arise from the existence or performance of the Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty or any other of the
Credit Documents (all such claims and rights being referred to as the "Guarantor's Conditional Rights"), including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or indemnification, or any right to participate in
any claim or remedy which the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent have against the Borrower or any collateral which the Lenders or
Lead Administrative Agent have or thereafter acquire for the Obligations, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity
or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or setoff or in any other manner, payment or
security on account of such claim or other rights.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to the
Guarantor on account of the Guarantor's Conditional Rights and either (a) such amount is paid to the Guarantor at any time when the
Obligations shall not have been paid or performed in full, or (b) regardless of when such amount is paid to the Guarantor any payment
made by Borrower to the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent is at any time determined to be a preferential payment, then such amount
paid to the Guarantor shall be deemed to be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent and shall
forthwith be paid to the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in such order and manner as the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent shall determine.  To the extent that any of the
provisions of this Paragraph shall not be enforceable, the Guarantor agrees that until such time as the Obligations have been paid
and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Borrower or the Guarantor to the
Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent may be determined to be a preferential payment, the Guarantor's Conditional Rights to the extent
not validly waived shall be subordinate to the Lenders' or Lead Administrative Agent's right to full payment and performance of the
Obligations and the Guarantor shall not seek to enforce the Guarantor's Conditional Rights during such period.  Guarantor waives all
presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
additional Obligations.  Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of Borrower's financial condition
and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of
the risks which Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither Lenders nor Lead Administrative Agent shall have any
duty to advise Guarantor of information known to any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       In addition to the Obligations, Guarantor agrees to pay reasonable attorneys' fees and all other costs and expenses
incurred by Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent in enforcing this Guaranty in any action or proceeding arising out of, or relating
to, this Guaranty.  This Guaranty and the liability and obligations of Guarantor hereunder are binding upon Guarantor and its
successors and assigns, and this Guaranty inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent and
their successors, transferees, and assigns.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       No right or power of Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been waived by any act
or conduct on the part of such Persons, or by any neglect to exercise such right or power, or by any delay in so doing; and every
right or power shall continue in full force and effect until specifically waived or released by an instrument in writing executed by
Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent.

         10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Guarantor agrees to execute any and all further documents, instruments and agreements as Lead Administrative Agent
from time to time reasonably requests to evidence Guarantor's obligations hereunder.

GAAP on and as of each Applicable Financial Test Date to be less than $2,500,000,000.00.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
                  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Guarantor hereby agrees that it will not declare or pay any dividends upon any shares of Guarantor's stock
now or hereafter outstanding, except dividends payable in the capital stock or stock rights of Guarantor, or make any distribution of
assets to its stockholders including, without limitation, pursuant to any stock repurchase, whether in cash, property or securities;
provided, however, that if at the date of such payment or distribution (both before and after giving effect thereto) there shall not
exist an Event of Default or Potential Default, Guarantor may pay dividends and make other distributions not later than 120 days
after the end of any fiscal quarter or year, as applicable, in an aggregate amount which does not exceed, when combined with all
prior dividends and other distributions, if any, applicable to such fiscal year to date, the greater of: (i) the after tax net income
of Guarantor determined in accordance with GAAP for such fiscal year to the date of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of such
fiscal year, and (ii) the aggregate dollar amount of dividends and other distributions paid during the immediately preceding year.

forth in Paragraph 8 of the Credit Agreement are accurate and complete and are incorporated herein by this reference.

construed and enforced accordingly.

otherwise, of the Obligations, whether heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created, whether voluntary or involuntary and
however arising, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, whether or not such Obligations are
from time to time reduced, or extinguished and thereafter increased or incurred, whether Borrower may be liable individually or
jointly with others, whether or not recovery upon such Obligations may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations,
and whether or not such Obligations may be or hereafter become otherwise invalid or unenforceable.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the payment of the Obligations whether or not due or payable by
Borrower upon: (a) the dissolution, insolvency or business failure of, or any assignment for the benefit of creditors by, or
commencement of any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceedings by or against, Borrower or
Guarantor, or (b) the appointment of a receiver for, or the attachment, restraint of or making or levying of any order of court or

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       The liability of Guarantor hereunder is exclusive and independent of any security for or other guaranty of the
Obligations, whether executed by Guarantor or by any other party, and the liability of Guarantor hereunder is not affected or
impaired by (a) any direction of application of payment by Borrower or by any other party, or (b) any other guaranty, undertaking or
maximum liability of Guarantor or of any other party as to the Obligations, or (c) any payment on or in reduction of any such other
guaranty or undertaking, or (d) any revocation or release of any obligations of any other guarantor of the Obligations, or (e) any

Administrative Agent on the Obligations which any of such Persons repay to Borrower pursuant to court order in any bankruptcy,
reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other debtor relief proceeding, and Guarantor waives any right to the deferral or
modification of Guarantor's obligations hereunder by reason of any such proceeding.

         4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       (a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The obligations of Guarantor hereunder are independent of the Obligations of Borrower, and a separate
action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against Guarantor whether or not action is brought against Borrower and whether or
not Borrower is joined in any such action or actions.  Guarantor waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement thereof.  Any payment by Borrower or other circumstance
which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to Guarantor.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
                  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      All payments made by Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be made without set-off or counterclaim and free
and clear of and without deductions for any present or future taxes, fees, withholdings or conditions of any nature ("Taxes").
Guarantor shall pay any such Taxes, including Taxes on any amounts so paid, and will promptly furnish each Lender with copies of any
tax receipts or such other evidence of payment as Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent may require.

         5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor authorizes Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent (whether or not after termination of this Guaranty),
without notice or demand (except as shall be required by applicable statute and cannot be waived), and without affecting or impairing
its liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise, extend, increase, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment of, or otherwise change the terms of, Obligations or any part thereof, including increase or decrease of the rate of interest
thereon; (b) take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Obligations and exchange, enforce, waive and release any
such security; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent in
their discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute any one or more endorsers, guarantors, Borrower or other obligors.
Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent may without notice to or the further consent of Borrower or Guarantor assign this Guaranty in
whole or in part to any person acquiring an interest in the Obligations.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       It is not necessary for Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent to inquire into the capacity or power of Borrower or
the officers acting or purporting to act on its behalf, and Obligations made or created in reliance upon the professed exercise of
such powers shall be guaranteed hereunder.
</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>
         7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Guarantor waives any right to require Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent to (a) proceed against Borrower or any
other party; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrower; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Lenders' power
whatsoever.  Guarantor waives any personal defense based on or arising out of any personal defense of Borrower other than payment in
full of the Obligations, including, without limitation, any defense based on or arising out of the disability of Borrower, or the
invalidity or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the
liability of Borrower other than payment in full of the Obligations.  Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent may, at their election,
exercise any right or remedy Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent may have against Borrower, or any security, without affecting or
impairing in any way the liability of Guarantor hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid.  Guarantor waives any
defense arising out of any such election, even though such election operates to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or
subrogation or other right or remedy of Guarantor against Borrower or any security.  Guarantor hereby waives any claim or other
rights which Guarantor may now have or may hereafter acquire against the Borrower or any other guarantor of all or any of the
Obligations that arise from the existence or performance of the Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty or any other of the
Credit Documents (all such claims and rights being referred to as the "Guarantor's Conditional Rights"), including, without
limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution, or indemnification, or any right to participate in
any claim or remedy which the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent have against the Borrower or any collateral which the Lenders or
Lead Administrative Agent have or thereafter acquire for the Obligations, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity
or under contract, statute or common law, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, including, without limitation, the right to
take or receive from the Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or setoff or in any other manner, payment or
security on account of such claim or other rights.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any amount shall be paid to the
Guarantor on account of the Guarantor's Conditional Rights and either (a) such amount is paid to the Guarantor at any time when the
Obligations shall not have been paid or performed in full, or (b) regardless of when such amount is paid to the Guarantor any payment
made by Borrower to the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent is at any time determined to be a preferential payment, then such amount
paid to the Guarantor shall be deemed to be held in trust for the benefit of the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent and shall
forthwith be paid to the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent to be credited and applied upon the Obligations, whether matured or
unmatured, in such order and manner as the Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent shall determine.  To the extent that any of the
provisions of this Paragraph shall not be enforceable, the Guarantor agrees that until such time as the Obligations have been paid
and performed in full and the period of time has expired during which any payment made by the Borrower or the Guarantor to the
Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent may be determined to be a preferential payment, the Guarantor's Conditional Rights to the extent
not validly waived shall be subordinate to the Lenders' or Lead Administrative Agent's right to full payment and performance of the
Obligations and the Guarantor shall not seek to enforce the Guarantor's Conditional Rights during such period.  Guarantor waives all
presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including, without limitation, notices of nonperformance, notices of
protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Guaranty, and notices of the existence, creation or incurring of new or
additional Obligations.  Guarantor assumes all responsibility for being and keeping itself informed of Borrower's financial condition
and assets, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and the nature, scope and extent of
the risks which Guarantor assumes and incurs hereunder, and agrees that neither Lenders nor Lead Administrative Agent shall have any
duty to advise Guarantor of information known to any of them regarding such circumstances or risks.

incurred by Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent in enforcing this Guaranty in any action or proceeding arising out of, or relating
to, this Guaranty.  This Guaranty and the liability and obligations of Guarantor hereunder are binding upon Guarantor and its
successors and assigns, and this Guaranty inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent and
their successors, transferees, and assigns.

         9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       No right or power of Lenders or Lead Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been waived by any act
or conduct on the part of such Persons, or by any neglect to exercise such right or power, or by any delay in so doing; and every
right or power shall continue in full force and effect until specifically waived or released by an instrument in writing executed by
Lenders and Lead Administrative Agent.
