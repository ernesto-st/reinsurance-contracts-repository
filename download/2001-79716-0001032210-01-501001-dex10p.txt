         (B) the date of the requested borrowing (which shall be a Business
         Day), (C) the aggregate principal amount to be borrowed, and (D)
         whether the borrowing shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar
         Loans or a combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are requested,
         the Interest Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to specify
         in any such Notice of Borrowing (I) an applicable Interest Period in
         the case of a Eurodollar Loan, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request for an Interest Period of one month, or (II) the type of
         Revolving Loan requested, then such notice shall be deemed to be a
         request for a Base Rate Loan hereunder. The Agent shall give notice to
         each affected Lender promptly upon receipt of each Notice of Borrowing
         pursuant to this Section 2.1(b)(i), the contents thereof and each such
         Lender's share of any borrowing to be made pursuant thereto.

               (ii)   Minimum Amounts. Except for Revolving Loans made for the
                      ---------------
         purpose of reimbursing the Issuing Lender in respect of a drawing under
         a Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 2.2(e), each Eurodollar Loan or
         Base Rate Loan that is a Revolving Loan shall be in a minimum aggregate
         principal amount of $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
         excess thereof (or the remaining amount of the Revolving Committed
         Amount, if less).

               (iii)  Advances.  Each Lender will make its Revolving Commitment
                      --------
         Percentage of each Revolving Loan borrowing available to the Agent for
         the account of the Borrower as specified in Section 3.15(a), or in such
         other manner as the Agent may specify in writing, by 12:00 noon (San
         Francisco, California time) on the date specified in the applicable
         Notice of Borrowing in Dollars and in funds immediately

                                       29
<PAGE>

         available to the Agent. Such borrowing will then be made available to
         the Borrower by the Agent by crediting the account of the Borrower on
         the books of such office with the aggregate of the amounts made
         available to the Agent by the Lenders and in like funds as received by
         the Agent.

         (c)   Repayment. The Borrower hereby promises to pay the principal
               ---------
     amount of all outstanding Revolving Loans in full on the Maturity Date,
     unless accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2.

         (d)   Interest.  Subject to the provisions of Section 3.1,
               --------

               (i)    Base Rate Loans.  During such periods as Revolving Loans
                      ---------------
         shall be comprised in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans, such Base
         Rate Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         Adjusted Base Rate.

               (ii)   Eurodollar Loans.  During such periods as Revolving Loans
                      ----------------
         shall be comprised in whole or in part of Eurodollar Loans, such
         Eurodollar Loans shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the
         Adjusted Eurodollar Rate.

     The Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on Revolving Loans in arrears
     on each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be
     specified herein).

         (e)   Revolving Notes. The Borrower hereby agrees that, upon the
               ---------------
     request to the Agent by any Lender, the Borrower will execute and deliver
     to such Lender a promissory note evidencing the Revolving Loans of such
     Lender, substantially in the form of Exhibit 2.1(e) (a "Revolving Note").

         2.2   Letter of Credit Subfacility.
               ----------------------------

         (a)   Issuance. The Existing Letters of Credit have previously been
               --------
     issued by the applicable Issuing Lender and subject to the terms and
     conditions hereof and in reliance upon the representations and warranties
     set forth herein, Bank of America, in its capacity as an Issuing Lender,
     agrees to issue, the applicable Issuing Lender agrees to renew, extend and
     modify and each Lender with a Revolving Commitment severally agrees to
     participate in the issuance by such Issuing Lender of, standby Letters of
     Credit in Dollars from time to time from the Closing Date until the date
     thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date as the Borrower may request, by
     delivering a Letter of Credit Application to the applicable Issuing Lender;
     provided, however, that (i) the LOC Obligations outstanding shall not at
     --------  -------
     any time exceed ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS ($110,000,000) (the "LOC
                                                                          ---
     Committed Amount") and (ii) the sum of the aggregate outstanding principal
     ----------------
     amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations shall not at any time exceed
                               ----
     the Revolving Committed Amount. No Letter of Credit shall (x) have an
     original expiry date more than one year from the date of issuance (provided
     that any such Letter of Credit may contain customary "evergreen" provisions
     pursuant to which the expiry date is automatically extended by a specific
     time period unless the applicable Issuing Lender gives notice to the
     beneficiary of such Letter of Credit at least a specified time period prior
     to the expiry date

                                       30
<PAGE>

     then in effect) or (y) as originally issued or as extended, have an expiry
     date extending beyond the date thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date.
     Each Letter of Credit shall comply with the related LOC Documents. The
     issuance date of each Letter of Credit shall be a Business Day. All
     Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant
     hereto, and from and after the Closing Date shall be subject to and
     governed by the terms and conditions hereof.

         (b)   Notice and Reports. The request for the issuance of a Letter of
               ------------------
     Credit shall be submitted by the Borrower to the applicable Issuing Lender
     and the Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested date
     of issuance. The Agent will, at least quarterly and more frequently upon
     request, disseminate to each of the Lenders a detailed report specifying
     the Letters of Credit which are then issued and outstanding and any
     activity with respect thereto which may have occurred since the date of the
     prior report, and including therein, among other things, the beneficiary,
     the face amount and the expiry date, as well as any payment or expirations
     which may have occurred.

         (c)   Participation. Each Lender, upon issuance of a Letter of Credit,
               -------------
     shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a Participation Interest
     from the applicable Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit (including each
     Existing Letter of Credit) and the obligations arising thereunder and any
     collateral relating thereto, in each case in an amount equal to its pro
     rata share of the obligations under such Letter of Credit (based on the
     respective Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders) and shall
     absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably assume and be obligated to pay
     to such Issuing Lender and discharge when due, its pro rata share of the
     obligations arising under such Letter of Credit (including each Existing
     Letter of Credit). Without limiting the scope and nature of each Lender's
     Participation Interest in any Letter of Credit, to the extent that an
     Issuing Lender has not been reimbursed as required hereunder or under any
     such Letter of Credit, each such Lender shall pay to such Issuing Lender
     its pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing in same day funds on the
     day of notification by such Issuing Lender of an unreimbursed drawing
     pursuant to the provisions of subsection (d) below. The obligation of each
     Lender to so reimburse the Issuing Lender shall be absolute and
     unconditional and shall not be affected by the occurrence of a Default, an
     Event of Default or any other occurrence or event. Any such reimbursement
     shall not relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to
     reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit,
     together with interest as hereinafter provided.

         (d)   Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing under any Letter of
               -------------
     Credit, the applicable Issuing Lender will promptly notify the Borrower.
     Unless the Borrower shall immediately notify such Issuing Lender that the
     Borrower intends to otherwise reimburse such Issuing Lender for such
     drawing, the Borrower shall be deemed to have requested that the Lenders
     make a Revolving Loan in the amount of the drawing as provided in
     subsection (e) below on the related Letter of Credit, the proceeds of which
     will be used to satisfy the related reimbursement obligations. The Borrower
     promises to reimburse the applicable Issuing Lender on the day of drawing
     under any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a Revolving Loan
     obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds. If the Borrower shall
     fail to reimburse any Issuing Lender as provided hereinabove, the Borrower

                                       31
<PAGE>

     promises to pay such Issuing Lender interest on the unreimbursed amount of
     such drawing on demand at a per annum rate equal to the Adjusted Base Rate
     plus 2%. The Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder shall be
     absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any
     rights of setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment the Borrower may claim
     or have against any Issuing Lender, the Agent, the Lenders, the beneficiary
     of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including without
     limitation any defense based on any failure of the Borrower or any other
     Credit Party to receive consideration or the legality, validity, regularity
     or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit. The applicable Issuing Lender
     will promptly notify the Agent of the amount of any unreimbursed drawing
     and each Lender shall promptly pay to the Agent for the account of such
     Issuing Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds, the amount of
     such Lender's pro rata share of such unreimbursed drawing. Such payment
     shall be made on the day such notice is received by such Lender from such
     Issuing Lender if such notice is received at or before 12:00 noon (San
     Francisco, California time), and otherwise such payment shall be made at or
     before 1:00 P.M. (San Francisco, California time) on the Business Day next
     succeeding the day such notice is received. If such Lender does not pay
     such amount to the Agent in full upon such request, such Lender shall, on
     demand, pay to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Lender interest on
     the unpaid amount during the period from the date of such drawing until
     such Lender pays such amount to such Issuing Lender in full at a rate per
     annum equal to, if paid within two (2) Business Days of the date that such
     Lender is required to make payments of such amount pursuant to the
     preceding sentence, the Federal Funds Rate and thereafter at a rate equal
     to the Base Rate. Each Lender's obligation to make such payment to the
     applicable Issuing Lender, and the right of such Issuing Lender to receive
     the same, shall be absolute and unconditional, shall not be affected by any
     circumstance whatsoever and without regard to the termination of this
     Credit Agreement or the Commitments hereunder, the existence of a Default
     or Event of Default or the acceleration of the obligations of the Borrower
     hereunder and shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or
     reduction whatsoever. Simultaneously with the making of each such payment
     by a Lender to an Issuing Lender, such Lender shall, automatically and
     without any further action on the part of such Issuing Lender or such
     Lender, acquire a Participation Interest in an amount equal to such payment
     (excluding the portion of such payment constituting interest owing to such
     Issuing Lender) in the related unreimbursed drawing portion of the LOC
     Obligation and in the interest thereon and in the related LOC Documents,
     and shall have a claim against the Borrower with respect thereto.

         (e)   Repayment with Revolving Loans. On any day on which the Borrower
               ------------------------------
     shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, a Revolving Loan
     advance to reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, the Agent shall
     give notice to the Lenders that a Revolving Loan has been requested or
     deemed requested by the Borrower to be made in connection with a drawing
     under a Letter of Credit, in which case a Revolving Loan advance comprised
     of Base Rate Loans (or Eurodollar Loans to the extent the Borrower has
     complied with the procedures of Section 2.1(b)(i) with respect thereto)
     shall be immediately made to the Borrower by all Lenders (notwithstanding
     any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2) pro rata based
                                                                 --- ----
     on the respective Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders
     (determined before giving effect to any termination of the Commitments
     pursuant to Section 9.2) and the proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to
     the

                                       32
<PAGE>

     applicable Issuing Lender for application to the respective LOC
     Obligations. Each such Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make its pro
     rata share of each such Revolving Loan immediately upon any such request or
     deemed request in the amount, in the manner and on the date specified in
     the preceding sentence notwithstanding (i) the amount of such borrowing may
                            ---------------
     not comply with the minimum amount for advances of Revolving Loans
     otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in
     Section 5.2 are then satisfied, (iii) whether a Default or an Event of
     Default then exists, (iv) failure for any such request or deemed request
     for Revolving Loan to be made by the time otherwise required hereunder, (v)
     whether the date of such borrowing is a date on which Revolving Loans are
     otherwise permitted to be made hereunder or (vi) any termination of the
     Commitments relating thereto immediately prior to or contemporaneously with
     such borrowing. In the event that any Revolving Loan cannot for any reason
     be made on the date otherwise required above (including, without
     limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the
     Bankruptcy Code with respect to the Borrower or any other Credit Party),
     then each such Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of
     the date such borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any
     payments received from the Borrower on or after such date and prior to such
     purchase) from the applicable Issuing Lender such Participation Interests
     in the outstanding LOC Obligations as shall be necessary to cause each such
     Lender to share in such LOC Obligations ratably (based upon the respective
     Revolving Commitment Percentages of the Lenders (determined before giving
     effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 9.2)),
     provided that at the time any purchase of Participation Interests pursuant
     --------
     to this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required
     to pay to such Issuing Lender, to the extent not paid to such Issuing
     Lender by the Borrower in accordance with the terms of subsection (d)
     above, interest on the principal amount of Participation Interests
     purchased for each day from and including the day upon which such borrowing
     would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such
     Participation Interests, at the rate equal to, if paid within two (2)
     Business Days of the date of the Revolving Loan advance, the Federal Funds
     Rate, and thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate.

         (f)   Designation of Consolidated Parties as Account Parties.
               ------------------------------------------------------
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Credit
     Agreement, including without limitation Section 2.2(a), a Letter of Credit
     may be issued hereunder for the account of any Subsidiary of the Borrower,
     provided that, the Borrower shall be the actual applicant for all purposes
     of this Credit Agreement for such Letter of Credit and such statement shall
     not affect the Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder with respect
     to such Letter of Credit.

         (g)   Renewal, Extension.  The renewal or extension of any Letter of
               ------------------
     Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as
     the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

         (h)   Applicability of ISP98. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the
               ----------------------
     applicable Issuing Lender and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is
     issued, the rules of the "International Standby Practices 1998" published
     by the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice (or such later
     version thereof as may be in effect at the time of issuance) shall apply to
     each Letter of Credit.

         (i)   Indemnification; Nature of Issuing Lender's Duties.
               --------------------------------------------------

               (i)    In addition to its other obligations under this Section
          2.2, the Borrower hereby agrees to pay, and protect, indemnify and
          save each Lender harmless from and against, any and all claims,
          demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses
          (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that such Lender may incur or
          be subject to as a consequence, direct or indirect, of (A) the
          issuance of any Letter of Credit or (B) the failure of such Lender to
          honor a drawing under a Letter of Credit as a result of any act or
          omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de
          jure or de facto government or Governmental Authority (all such acts
          or omissions, herein called "Government Acts").
                                       ---------------

               (ii)   As between the Borrower and the Lenders (including each
          Issuing Lender), the Borrower shall assume all risks of the acts,
          omissions or misuse of any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary
          thereof. No Lender (including an Issuing Lender) shall be responsible:
          (A) for the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or
          legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with
          the application for and issuance of any Letter of Credit, even if it
          should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid,
          insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged; (B) for the validity
          or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or
          purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of Credit or the rights or
          benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, that may
          prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) for errors,
          omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any
          messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or
          not they be in cipher; (D) for any loss or delay in the transmission
          or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under
          a Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; and (E) for any
          consequences arising from causes beyond the control of such Lender,
          including, without limitation, any Government Acts. None of the above
          shall affect, impair, or prevent the vesting of an Issuing Lender's
          rights or powers hereunder.

               (iii)  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the
          specific provisions hereinabove set forth, any action taken or omitted
          by any Lender (including an Issuing Lender), under or in connection
          with any Letter of Credit or the related certificates, if taken or
          omitted in good faith, shall not put such Lender under any resulting
          liability to the Borrower or any other Credit Party. It is the
          intention of the parties that this Credit Agreement shall be construed
          and applied to protect and indemnify each Lender (including each
          Issuing Lender) against any and all risks involved in the issuance of
          the Letters of Credit, all of which risks are hereby assumed by the
          Borrower (on behalf of itself and each of the other Credit Parties),
          including, without limitation, any and all Government Acts. No Lender
          (including an Issuing Lender) shall, in any way, be liable for any
          failure by such Lender or anyone else to pay any drawing under any
          Letter of Credit as a result of any Government Acts or any other cause
          beyond the control of such Lender.

               (iv)   Nothing in this subsection (i) is intended to limit the
          reimbursement obligations of the Borrower contained in subsection (d)
          above. The obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (i) shall
          survive the termination of this Credit Agreement. No act or omission
          of any current or prior beneficiary of a Letter of Credit shall in any
          way affect or impair the rights of the Lenders (including each Issuing
          Lender) to enforce any right, power or benefit under this Credit
          Agreement.

               (v)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
          subsection (i), the Borrower shall have no obligation to indemnify any
          Lender (including an Issuing Lender) in respect of any liability
          incurred by such Lender (A) arising solely out of the gross negligence
          or willful misconduct of such Lender, as determined by a court of
          competent jurisdiction, or (B) caused by such Lender's failure to pay
          under any Letter of Credit after presentation to it of a request
          strictly complying with the terms and conditions of such Letter of
          Credit, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, unless
          such payment is prohibited by any law, regulation, court order or
          decree.

          (j)  Responsibility of Each Issuing Lender. It is expressly understood
               -------------------------------------
     and agreed that the obligations of each Issuing Lender hereunder to the
     Lenders are only those expressly set forth in this Credit Agreement and
     that each Issuing Lender shall be entitled to assume that the conditions
     precedent set forth in Section 5.2 have been satisfied unless it shall have
     acquired actual knowledge that any such condition precedent has not been
     satisfied; provided, however, that nothing set forth in this Section 2.2
                --------  -------
     shall be deemed to prejudice the right of any Lender to recover from any
     Issuing Lender any amounts made available by such Lender to such Issuing
     Lender pursuant to this Section 2.2 in the event that it is determined by a
     court of competent jurisdiction that the payment with respect to a Letter
     of Credit constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
     such Issuing Lender.

          (k)  Limitation on Obligation of Each Issuing Lender. Notwithstanding
               -----------------------------------------------
     anything contained herein to the contrary, no Issuing Lender shall be under
     any obligation to issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit if (i) any
     order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall
     by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing Lender from issuing
     a Letter of Credit, or any applicable law, rule or regulation or any
     request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
     governmental with jurisdiction over the Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or
     request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters of
     credit generally or any such Letter of Credit in particular, or shall
     impose upon the Issuing Lender with respect to any such Letter of Credit
     any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing
     Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing
     Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Lender any unreimbursed loss, costs
     or expense which was not applicable on the Closing Date and which such

         (l)   Conflict with LOC Documents. In the event of any conflict between
               ---------------------------
     this Credit Agreement and any LOC Document (including any Letter of Credit
     Application), this

                                       35
<PAGE>

     Credit Agreement shall control with respect to the Persons who are parties
     to this Credit Agreement and such LOC Document. Notwithstanding the
     generality of the foregoing, each of the Reimbursement Agreements set forth
     on Schedule 2.2(1) is and shall be deemed amended such that the
        ---------------
     representations and warranties, covenants and events of default (and
     definitions related thereto) set out in such Reimbursement Agreements (the
     "Existing Provisions"), except to the extent they relate specifically to
      -------------------
     the relevant bonds or relevant remarketing program, conform with the
     representations and warranties, covenants and events of default (and
     definitions related thereto) set out in this Credit Agreement (the
     "Incorporated Provisions"). Such amendments shall survive (i) the payment
      -----------------------
     in full of all obligations due the Lenders by the Borrower under this
     Credit Agreement, (ii) the termination (for any reason) of this Credit
     Agreement, (iii) the sale or participation (in whole or in part) of a
     Lender's interest in this Credit Agreement, or (iv) any other event which
     has the effect of terminating the obligations of the Borrower to the
     Lenders under this Credit Agreement. Upon the happening of one of the
     events set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Borrower agrees
     to promptly execute a modification of the relevant Reimbursement
     Agreement(s) to confirm such amendment. Notwithstanding the preceding
     sentence or the failure of any such modification to be executed, the
     Borrower must remain in compliance with the Incorporated Provisions as if
     set forth in the relevant Reimbursement Agreement(s). Any future
     modification of or amendment to the Incorporated Provisions shall be a
     modification of or amendment to the relevant Reimbursement Agreement(s) for
     purposes of compliance with such agreements. Likewise, if the Agent and the
     Required Lenders grant a waiver of compliance of the Incorporated
     Provisions for any period, such waiver shall be deemed to be a waiver of
     compliance of the relevant Reimbursement Agreement(s) for the limited
     period of time for which the waiver was granted.

               ---------

         (a)   Term Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and
               ---------------
     in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth herein each
     Lender severally agrees to make available to the Borrower, subject to the
     escrow arrangements described in Sections 5.1(j) and 6.15, on the Closing

                                  --------------------------
     may consist of Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Loans, or a combination
     thereof, as the Borrower may request; provided, however, that no more than
                                           --------  -------
     six (6) Eurodollar Loans which comprise the Term Loan shall be outstanding
     hereunder at any time (it being understood that, for purposes hereof,
     Eurodollar Loans with different Interest Periods shall be considered as
     separate Eurodollar Loans, even if they begin on the same date, although
     borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance with the
     provisions hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to
     constitute a new Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period). Amounts
     repaid on the Term Loan may not be reborrowed.

         (b)   Borrowing Procedures. The Borrower shall submit an appropriate
               --------------------
     Notice of Borrowing to the Agent not later than 10:00 A.M. (San Francisco,
     California time) on the Closing Date, with respect to the portion of the
     Term Loan initially consisting of a Base Rate Loan, or on the third
     Business Day prior to the Closing Date, with respect to the

                                       36
<PAGE>

     portion of the Term Loan initially consisting of one or more Eurodollar
     Loans. Such Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i)
     that the funding of a Term Loan is requested and (ii) whether the funding
     of the Term Loan shall be comprised of Base Rate Loans, Eurodollar Loans or
     a combination thereof, and if Eurodollar Loans are requested, the Interest
     Period(s) therefor. If the Borrower shall fail to deliver such Notice of
     Borrowing to the Agent by 10:00 A.M. (San Francisco, California time) on
     the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date, then the full amount of
     the Term Loan shall be disbursed on the Closing Date as a Base Rate Loan.
     Each Lender shall make its Term Loan Percentage of the Term Loan available
     to the Agent for the account of the Borrower, subject to the escrow
     arrangements described in Sections 5.1(j) and 6.15, at the office of the
     Agent specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at such other office as the Agent
                        ---------------
     may designate in writing, by 12:00 noon (San Francisco, California time) on
     the Closing Date in Dollars and in funds immediately available to the
     Agent.

         (c)   Minimum Amounts. Each Eurodollar Loan or Base Rate Loan that is
               ---------------
     part of the Term Loan shall be in an aggregate principal amount that is not
     less than $5,000,000 and integral multiples of $1,000,000 (or the then
     remaining principal balance of the Term Loan, if less).

         (d)   Repayment of Term Loan. The Borrower hereby promises to pay the
               ----------------------
     outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan in sixteen (16) quarterly
     consecutive installments as follows (as such installments may hereafter be
     adjusted as a result of prepayments made pursuant to Section 3.3) unless
     accelerated sooner pursuant to Section 9.2:

     The Borrower hereby promises to pay interest on the Term Loan in arrears on
     each applicable Interest Payment Date (or at such other times as may be
     specified herein).

               ------------

     Upon the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of Default,
(i) the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Loans
and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Credit Documents shall
bear interest, payable on demand, at a per annum rate 2% greater than the rate
which would otherwise be applicable (or if no rate is applicable, whether in
respect of interest, fees or other amounts, then the Adjusted Base Rate plus 2%)
                                                                        ----

provided in Section 3.8, Eurodollar Loans may be converted into Base Rate Loans
or extended as Eurodollar Loans for new Interest Periods only on the last day of
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) Loans extended as, or converted

although borrowings, extensions and conversions may, in accordance with the
provisions

                                       38
<PAGE>

hereof, be combined at the end of existing Interest Periods to constitute a new
Eurodollar Loan with a single Interest Period) and (iv) any request for
extension or conversion of a Eurodollar Loan which shall fail to specify an
Interest Period shall be deemed to be a request for an Interest Period of one
month. Each such extension or conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by
giving a Notice of Extension/Conversion (or telephonic notice promptly confirmed
in writing) to the office of the Agent specified in Schedule 2.1(a), or at such
                                                    ---------------
other office as the Agent may designate in writing, prior to 10:00 A.M. (San

conversion of a Base Rate Loan into, a Eurodollar Loan, the date of the proposed
extension or conversion, specifying the date of the proposed extension or
conversion, the Loans to be so extended or converted, the types of Loans into
which such Loans are to be converted and, if appropriate, the applicable
Interest Periods with respect thereto. In the event the Borrower fails to
request extension or conversion of any Eurodollar Loan in accordance with this
Section 3.2, or any such conversion or extension is not permitted or required by
this Section 3.2, then such Eurodollar Loan shall be automatically converted
into a Base Rate Loan at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. The
Agent shall give each Lender notice as promptly as practicable of any such
proposed extension or conversion affecting any Loan.

partial prepayment of Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000
and integral multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (or the then remaining
principal balance of the Revolving Loans or the Term Loan, as applicable, if
less). Subject to the foregoing terms, amounts prepaid under this Section 3.3(a)
shall be applied as the Borrower may elect; provided that if the Borrower shall
                                            --------
fail to specify with respect to any voluntary prepayment, such voluntary
prepayment shall be applied first to Revolving Loans and then to the Term Loan,
in each case first to Base Rate Loans and then to Eurodollar Loans in direct
order of Interest Period maturities. All prepayments under this Section 3.3(a)
shall be subject to Section 3.12, but otherwise without premium or penalty,
except for any applicable Term Loan Prepayment Fee, and shall be accompanied by
interest on the principal amount prepaid through the date of prepayment.

                         --------------------

          succeeding paragraph, all amounts required to be paid pursuant to this
          Section 3.3(b) shall be applied as follows: (A) with respect to all
          amounts prepaid pursuant to Section 3.3(b)(i)(A), to Revolving Loans

          the Revolving Loans and (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid)
          to a cash collateral account in respect of LOC Obligations (with a
          corresponding reduction in the Revolving Committed Amount in an amount
          equal to all amounts applied, or available to be applied, to Revolving
          Loans and in respect of LOC Obligations pursuant to this clause (2))
          and in the event the Term Loan shall have been fully repaid, all to
          the Revolving Loans and (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid)

          the Term Loan shall have been fully repaid, the Revolving Loans and
          (after all Revolving Loans have been repaid) to a cash collateral
          account in respect of LOC Obligations (with a corresponding reduction

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) to the extent that any mandatory
          prepayment required under this Section 3.3 would have the effect of
          reducing the Revolving Committed Amount below the amount necessary to
          support LOC Obligations, such portion of the prepayment shall be
          applied to a cash collateral account in respect of such LOC
          Obligations and the Revolving Committed Amount shall not be reduced
          thereby and (ii) the Borrower shall not be required to reduce the
          Revolving Committed Amount in connection with any mandatory prepayment
          of Revolving Loans to the extent the then current book value of the
          Properties of the Consolidated Parties after giving effect to the
          relevant transaction is greater than or equal to $1,500,000,000.

               (vi) Prepayment Account. If the Borrower is required to make a
                    ------------------
          mandatory prepayment of Eurodollar Loans under this Section 3.3(b),
          the Borrower shall have the right, as long as no Default or Event of
          Default then exists, in lieu of making such prepayment in full, to
          deposit an amount equal to such mandatory prepayment with the Agent in
          a cash collateral account maintained (pursuant to documentation
          reasonably satisfactory to the Agent) by and in the sole dominion and
          control of the Agent. Any amounts so deposited shall be held by the
          Agent as collateral for the prepayment of such Eurodollar Loans and
          shall be applied to the prepayment of the applicable Eurodollar Loans
          at the end of the current Interest Periods applicable thereto. At the
          request of the Borrower, amounts so deposited shall be invested by the
          Agent in Cash Equivalents maturing prior to the date or dates on which
          it is anticipated that such amounts will be applied to prepay such
          Eurodollar Loans; any interest earned on such Cash Equivalents will be
          for the account of the Borrower and the Borrower will deposit with the
          Agent the amount of any loss on any such Cash Equivalents to the
          extent necessary in order that the amount of the prepayment to be made
          with the deposited amounts may not be reduced.

          3.4   Termination and Reduction of Revolving Committed Amount.
                -------------------------------------------------------

          (a) Voluntary Reductions. The Borrower may from time to time
              --------------------
     permanently reduce or terminate the Revolving Committed Amount in whole or
     in part (in minimum

                                       41
<PAGE>

     aggregate amounts of $5,000,000 or in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in
     excess thereof (or, if less, the full remaining amount of the then
     applicable Revolving Committed Amount)) upon five Business Days' prior
     written notice to the Agent; provided, however, no such termination or
                                  --------  -------
     reduction shall be made which would cause the sum of the aggregate
     outstanding principal amount of Revolving Loans plus LOC Obligations to
                                                     ----
     exceed the Revolving Committed Amount, unless, concurrently with such
     termination or reduction, the Revolving Loans are repaid to the extent
     necessary to eliminate such excess. The Agent shall promptly notify each
     affected Lender of receipt by the Agent of any notice from the Borrower
     pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).

          (b) Term Loan Commitments. The Term Loan Commitment of each Lender, if
              ----------------------
     any, shall automatically terminate at such time as such Lender shall have
     made available to the Borrower such Lender's share of the Term Loan.

          (c) Mandatory Reductions. The Revolving Committed Amount automatically
              --------------------
     shall be permanently reduced from time to time in accordance with the terms
     of Section 3.3(b)(v).

          (d) Maturity Date. Unless terminated sooner pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
              -------------
     or Section 9.2, the Revolving Commitments of the Lenders and the LOC
     Commitment of the Issuing Lender shall automatically terminate on the
     Maturity Date.

          (e) General. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of
              -------
     the Lenders in accordance with the terms of Section 3.5(a), on the date of
     each termination or reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount, the Unused
     Fee accrued through the date of such termination or reduction on the amount
     of the Revolving Committed Amount so terminated or reduced.

          3.5  Fees.
               -----

          (a)  Unused Fee. In consideration of the Revolving Commitments of the
               -----------
     Lenders hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the
     account of each Lender a fee (the "Unused Fee") on the Unused Revolving
                                        ----------
     Committed Amount computed at a per annum rate for each day during the
     applicable Unused Fee Calculation Period (hereinafter defined) at a rate
     equal to the Applicable Percentage in effect from time to time. The Unused
     Fee shall commence to accrue on the Closing Date and shall be due and
     payable in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September
     and December (and on any date that the Revolving Committed Amount is
     reduced and on the Maturity Date) for the immediately preceding quarter (or
     portion thereof) (each such quarter or portion thereof for which the Unused
     Fee is payable hereunder being herein referred to as an "Unused Fee
                                                              ----------
     Calculation Period"), beginning with the first of such dates to occur after
     -------------------
     the Closing Date.

          (b) Letter of Credit Fee. In consideration of the issuance of Letters
              ---------------------
     of Credit hereunder, the Borrower promises to pay to the Agent for the
     account of each Lender a fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") on such Lender's
                                        --------------------
     Revolving Commitment Percentage of the average daily maximum amount
     available to be drawn under each such Letter of Credit

                                       42
<PAGE>

     computed at a per annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the
     date of expiration equal to the Applicable Percentage. The Letter of Credit
     Fee will be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each
     March, June, September and December for the immediately preceding quarter
     (or a portion thereof).

          (c) Issuing Lender Fees. In addition to the Letter of Credit Fee
              -------------------
     payable pursuant to clause (b) above the Borrower promises to pay to each
     Issuing Lender without sharing by the other Lenders (i) a letter of credit
     fronting fee of 0.125% on the average daily maximum amount available to be
     drawn under each Letter of Credit (other than the Existing Letters of
     Credit except in connection with renewals, modifications or extension of
     the Existing Letters of Credit) issued by such Issuing Lender computed at a
     per annum rate for each day from the date of issuance to the date of
     expiration (which fronting fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the
     last day of each March, June, September and December for the immediately
     preceding quarter (or a portion thereof)) and (ii) the customary charges
     from time to time of the Issuing Lender with respect to the issuance,
     amendment, transfer, administration, cancellation and conversion of, and
     drawings under, such Letters of Credit.

          (d) Agent's Fees. The Borrower promises to pay to the Agent, for its
              ------------
     own account, for the account of each Issuing Lender and for the account of
     the Arranger, as applicable, the fees referred to in the Agent's Fee
     Letter.

          (e) Term Loan Prepayment Fee. If the Term Loan becomes due and payable
              ------------------------
     or is prepaid in whole or in part, in each case on a day that is prior to
     the second anniversary of the Closing Date, then the Borrower shall, on the
     day on which the Term Loan becomes due and payable or is so prepaid, pay to
     the Agent, for account of the Lenders holding the Term Loan, an amount in
     Dollars equal to one percent (1%) of the amount of the Term Loan that has
     become due and payable or is so prepaid (the "Term Loan Prepayment Fee").
                                                   ------------------------

          3.6   Capital Adequacy.
                ----------------

     If any Lender has determined, after the date hereof, that the adoption or
the becoming effective of, or any change in, or any change by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof in the interpretation or administration of, any
applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or compliance by
such Lender with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's capital or assets as a consequence of its commitments or obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender could have achieved but for
such adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration
such Lender's policies with respect to capital adequacy), then, upon notice from
such Lender to the Borrower, the Borrower shall be obligated to pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
reduction. Each determination by any such Lender of amounts owing under this
Section shall, absent manifest error, be conclusive and binding on the parties
hereto.

                                       43

          3.7   Limitation on Eurodollar Loans.
                ------------------------------

          If on or prior to the first day of any Interest Period for any
Eurodollar Loan:

          (a) the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive)
     that by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant market, adequate and
     reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such
     Interest Period; or

          (b) the Required Lenders determine (which determination shall be
     conclusive) and notify the Agent that the Eurodollar Rate will not
     adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders of funding Eurodollar
     Loans for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give the Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long as
such condition remains in effect, the Lenders shall be under no obligation to
make additional Eurodollar Loans, Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Borrower shall, on the last day(s) of
the then current Interest Period(s) for the outstanding Eurodollar Loans, either
prepay such Eurodollar Loans or Convert such Eurodollar Loans into Base Rate
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Credit Agreement.

          3.8   Illegality.
                ----------

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Credit Agreement, in the event
that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office to
make, maintain, or fund Eurodollar Loans hereunder, then such Lender shall
promptly notify the Borrower thereof and such Lender's obligation to make or
Continue Eurodollar Loans and to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended until such time as such Lender may again make, maintain, and
fund Eurodollar Loans (in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be
applicable).

          3.9   Requirements of Law.
                -------------------

          If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule,
or regulation, or any change in any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law)
of any such Governmental Authority, central bank, or comparable agency:

          (i) shall subject such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
     Office) to any tax, duty, or other charge with respect to any Eurodollar
     Loans, its Notes, or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or change the
     basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Lender (or its Applicable
     Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or its Notes in respect of any
     Eurodollar Loans (other than taxes imposed on the overall net income of
     such Lender by the jurisdiction in which such Lender has its principal
     office or such Applicable Lending Office);

                                       44
<PAGE>

          (ii) shall impose, modify, or deem applicable any reserve,
     special deposit, assessment, or similar requirement (other than the
     Eurodollar Reserve Percentage utilized in the determination of the Adjusted
     Eurodollar Rate) relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of,
     or any deposits with or other liabilities or commitments of, such Lender
     (or its Applicable Lending Office), including the Commitment of such Lender
     hereunder; or

          (iii) shall impose on such Lender (or its Applicable Lending
     Office) or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this
     Credit Agreement or its Notes or any of such extensions of credit or
     liabilities or commitments;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, Converting into, Continuing, or
maintaining any Eurodollar Loans or to reduce any sum received or receivable by
such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Credit Agreement or
its Notes with respect to any Eurodollar Loans, then the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender on demand such amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such increased cost or reduction. If any Lender requests compensation by the
Borrower under this Section 3.9, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender
(with a copy to the Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender to make or
Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans,
until the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect
(in which case the provisions of Section 3.10 shall be applicable); provided
that such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive the
compensation so requested. Each Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date
hereof, which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section
3.9 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation
will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will
not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. Any
Lender claiming compensation under this Section 3.9 shall furnish to the
Borrower and the Agent a statement setting forth the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder which shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable
averaging and attribution methods.

          3.10  Treatment of Affected Loans.
                ---------------------------

          If the obligation of any Lender to make any Eurodollar Loan or to
Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be
suspended pursuant to Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof, such Lender's Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on the last day(s)
of the then current Interest Period(s) for such Eurodollar Loans (or, in the
case of a Conversion, on such earlier date as such Lender may specify to the
Borrower with a copy to the Agent) and, unless and until such Lender gives
notice as provided below that the circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or
3.9 hereof that gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

          (a) to the extent that such Lender's Eurodollar Loans have
     been so Converted, all payments and prepayments of principal that would
     otherwise be applied to such Lender's Eurodollar Loans shall be applied
     instead to its Base Rate Loans; and

          (b) all Loans that would otherwise be made or Continued by such Lender
     as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or Continued instead as Base Rate Loans,
     and all Base Rate

                                       45
<PAGE>

     Loans of such Lender that would otherwise be Converted into Eurodollar
     Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Lender gives notice to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent) that the
circumstances specified in Section 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9 hereof that gave rise to the
Conversion of such Lender's Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 3.10 no
longer exist (which such Lender agrees to do promptly upon such circumstances
ceasing to exist) at a time when Eurodollar Loans made by other Lenders are
outstanding, such Lender's Base Rate Loans shall be automatically Converted, on
the first day(s) of the next succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding
Eurodollar Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect thereto,
all Loans held by the Lenders holding Eurodollar Loans and by such Lender are
held pro rata (as to principal amounts, interest rate basis, and Interest
Periods) in accordance with their respective Commitments.

          3.11  Taxes.
                -----

          (a) Any and all payments by any Credit Party to or for the
     account of any Lender or the Agent hereunder or under any other Credit
     Document shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and
     all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges
     or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in
                                                                ---------
     the case of each Lender and the Agent, taxes imposed on its income, and
     franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction under the laws of which
     such Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the Agent (as the case
     may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof (all such non-
     excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges, withholdings,
     and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes"). If any Credit
                                                       -----
     Party shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
     any sum payable under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document to
     any Lender or the Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as
     necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
     deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 3.11)
     such Lender or the Agent receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
     received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Credit Party shall
     make such deductions, (iii) such Credit Party shall pay the full amount
     deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
     accordance with applicable law, and (iv) such Credit Party shall furnish to
     the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 11.1, the original or a
     certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.

          (b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or
     future stamp or documentary taxes and any other excise or property taxes or
     charges or similar levies which arise from any payment made under this
     Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document or from the execution or
     delivery of, or otherwise with respect to, this Credit Agreement or any
     other Credit Document (hereinafter referred to as "Other Taxes").
                                                        -----------

          (c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Agent
     for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without
     limitation, any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any
     jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section 3.11) paid by such
     Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
     penalties, interest, and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
     thereto.

                                       46
<PAGE>

          (d) Each Lender that is not a United States person under
     Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code, on or prior to the date of its execution
     and delivery of this Credit Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on
     the signature pages hereof and on or prior to the date on which it becomes
     a Lender in the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter
     if requested in writing by the Borrower or the Agent (but only so long as
     such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide the Borrower and
     the Agent with (i) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 BEN or W-8 ECI, as
     appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
     Service, certifying that such Lender is entitled to benefits under an
     income tax treaty to which the United States is a party which reduces to
     zero the rate of withholding tax on payments of interest or certifying that
     the income receivable pursuant to this Credit Agreement is effectively
     connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States,
     (ii) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9, as appropriate, or any
     successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and/or (iii) any
     other form or certificate required by any taxing authority (including any
     certificate required by Sections 871(h) and 881(c) of the Internal Revenue
     Code), certifying that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from tax on
     payments pursuant to this Credit Agreement or any of the other Credit
     Documents.

          (e) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed
     to provide the Borrower and the Agent with the appropriate form pursuant to
     Section 3.11(d) (unless such failure is due to a change in treaty, law, or
     regulation occurring subsequent to the date on which a form originally was
     required to be provided), such Lender shall not be entitled to
     indemnification under Section 3.11(a) or 3.11(b) with respect to Taxes
     imposed by the United States; provided, however, that should a Lender,
                                   --------  -------
     which is otherwise exempt from withholding tax, become subject to Taxes
     because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower,
     at the cost and expense of the Lender, shall take such steps as such Lender
     shall reasonably request to assist such Lender to recover such Taxes.

          (f) If any Credit Party is required to pay additional amounts
     to or for the account of any Lender pursuant to this Section 3.11, then
     such Lender will agree to use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction
     of its Applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate or reduce any such
     additional payment which may thereafter accrue if such change, in the
     judgment of such Lender, is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

          (g) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
     Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit
     Parties contained in this Section 3.11 shall survive the repayment of the
     Loans, LOC Obligations and other obligations under the Credit Documents and
     the termination of the Commitments hereunder.

          3.12  Compensation.
                ------------

          Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Agent) from time to
time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such
Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

                                       47
<PAGE>

          (a) any Continuation, Conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
     other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the
     Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by
     reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

          (b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
     of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, Continue or Convert any
     Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by
     the Borrower; or

          (c) any assignment of a Eurodollar Loan on a day other than the last
     day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
     Borrower pursuant to Section 3.17;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.
The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such
Lender in connection with the foregoing.

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.12, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurodollar
Loan made by it at the Interbank Offered Rate for such Loan by a matching
deposit or other borrowing in the applicable offshore Dollar interbank market
for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurodollar Loan was in fact so funded. The covenants of the Borrower set forth
in this Section 3.12 shall survive the repayment of the Loans, LOC Obligations
and other obligations under the Credit Documents and the termination of the
Commitments hereunder.

          3.13  Pro Rata Treatment.
                ------------------

     Except to the extent otherwise provided herein:

         (a) Loans. Each Loan, each payment or (subject to the terms of Section
             -----
     3.3) prepayment of principal of any Loan or reimbursement obligations
     arising from drawings under Letters of Credit, each payment of interest on
     the Loans or reimbursement obligations arising from drawings under Letters
     of Credit, each payment of Unused Fees, each payment of the Letter of
     Credit Fee, each reduction of the Revolving Committed Amount and each
     conversion or extension of any Loan, shall be allocated pro rata among the
     Lenders in accordance with the respective principal amounts of their
     outstanding Loans of the applicable type and Participation Interests in
     Loans of the applicable type and Letters of Credit.

         (b)  Advances.
              --------

         (i)  No Lender shall be responsible for the failure or delay by any
     other Lender in its obligation to make its ratable share of a borrowing
     hereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender to fulfill its
                --------  -------
     obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations
     hereunder.

                                       48
<PAGE>

         (ii) Unless the Borrower or any Lender has notified the Agent prior to
     the date any payment is required to be made by it to the Agent hereunder,
     that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case may be, will not make such
     payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower or such Lender, as the case
     may be, has timely made such payment and may (but shall not be so required
     to), in reliance thereon, make available a corresponding amount to the
     Person entitled thereto. If and to the extent that such payment was not in
     fact made to the Agent in immediately available funds, then:

              (A)  if the Borrower failed to make such payment, each Lender
         shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent the portion of such
         assumed payment that was made available to such Lender in immediately
         available funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day
         from and including the date such amount was made available by the Agent
         to such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent in
         immediately available funds, at the Federal Funds Rate from time to
         time in effect; and

              (B)  if any Lender failed to make such payment, such Lender shall
         forthwith on demand pay to the Agent the amount thereof in immediately
         available funds, together with interest thereon for the period from the
         date such amount was made available by the Agent to the Borrower to the
         date such amount is recovered by the Agent (the "Compensation Period")
                                                          -------------------
         at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate from time to time
         in effect. If such Lender does not pay such amount forthwith upon the
         Agent's demand therefor, the Agent may make a demand therefor upon the
         Borrower, and the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent, together
         with interest thereon for the Compensation Period at a rate per annum
         equal to the rate of interest applicable to the applicable Borrowing.

     Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to
fulfill its Commitment or to prejudice any rights that the Agent or the Borrower
may have against any Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.
A notice of the Agent to any Lender with respect to any amount owing under this
subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

          3.14  Sharing of Payments.
                -------------------

     The Lenders agree among themselves that, in the event that any Lender shall
obtain payment in respect of any Loan, LOC Obligations or any other obligation
owing to such Lender under this Credit Agreement through the exercise of a right
of setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of Title 11 of the United States Code or other security or interest
arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Lender under
any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by
any other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for
in this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other
Lenders a Participation Interest in such Loans, LOC Obligations and other
obligations in such amounts, and make such other adjustments from time to time,
as shall be equitable to the end that all Lenders share such payment in
accordance with their

                                       49
<PAGE>

respective ratable shares as provided for in this Credit Agreement. The Lenders
further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such
Lender through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim or
other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each
Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase
of a Participation Interest theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a Participation Interest
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment,
including setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such
Participation Interest as fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan,
LOC Obligations or other obligation in the amount of such Participation
Interest. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Credit Agreement, if
any Lender shall fail to remit to the Agent or any other Lender an amount
payable by such Lender to the Agent or such other Lender pursuant to this Credit
Agreement on the date when such amount is due, such payments shall be made
together with interest thereon for each date from the date such amount is due
until the date such amount is paid to the Agent or such other Lender at a rate
per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate. If under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law, any Lender receives a secured claim in lieu of
a setoff to which this Section 3.14 applies, such Lender shall, to the extent
practicable, exercise its rights in respect of such secured claim in a manner
consistent with the rights of the Lenders under this Section 3.14 to share in
the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

          3.15  Payments, Computations, Etc.
                ---------------------------

         (a)  Generally. The Credit Party Obligations shall not be deemed to be
              ---------
     paid in full until the same are Fully Satisfied hereunder. Except as
     otherwise specifically provided herein, all payments hereunder shall be
     made to the Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds, without
     condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff
     of any kind, at the Agent's office specified in Schedule 2.1(a) not later
                                                     ---------------
     than 12:00 noon (San Francisco, California time) on the date when due.
     Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on
     the next succeeding Business Day. The Agent may (but shall not be obligated
     to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by such time to
     any ordinary deposit account of the Borrower or any other Credit Party
     maintained with the Agent (with notice to the Borrower or such other Credit
     Party). The Borrower shall, at the time it makes any payment under this
     Credit Agreement, specify to the Agent the Loans, LOC Obligations, Fees,
     interest or other amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder to which such
     payment is to be applied (and in the event that it fails so to specify, or
     if such application would be inconsistent with the terms hereof, the Agent
     shall distribute such payment to the Lenders in such manner as the Agent
     may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by the
     Borrower hereunder, subject to the terms of Section 3.13(a)). The Agent
     will distribute such payments to such Lenders, if any such payment is
     received prior to 12:00 noon (San Francisco, California time) on a Business
     Day in like funds as received prior to the end of such Business Day and
     otherwise the Agent will distribute such payment to such Lenders on the
     next succeeding Business Day. Whenever any payment hereunder shall be
     stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof
     shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day (subject to accrual
     of interest and Fees for the period of such extension), except that in the
     case of Eurodollar

                                       50
<PAGE>

     Loans, if the extension would cause the payment to be made in the next
     following calendar month, then such payment shall instead be made on the
     next preceding Business Day. Except as expressly provided otherwise herein,
     all computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of actual
     number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days, except with respect to
     computation of interest on Base Rate Loans which shall be calculated based
     on a year of 365 or 366 days, as appropriate. Interest shall accrue from
     and include the date of borrowing, but exclude the date of payment.

          (b) Allocation of Payments After Acceleration. Notwithstanding any
              -----------------------------------------
     other provisions of this Credit Agreement to the contrary, after
     acceleration of the Credit Party Obligations pursuant to Section 9.2, all
     amounts collected or received by the Agent or any Lender on account of the
     Credit Party Obligations or any other amounts outstanding under any of the
     Credit Documents or in respect of the Collateral shall be paid over or
     delivered as follows:

               FIRST, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
          expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) of
          the Agent in connection with enforcing the rights of the Lenders under
          the Credit Documents and any protective advances made by the Agent
          with respect to the Collateral under or pursuant to the terms of the
          Collateral Documents;

               SECOND, to payment of any fees owed to the Agent;

               THIRD, to the payment of all of the Credit Party Obligations
          consisting of accrued fees and interest;

               FOURTH, to the payment of the outstanding principal amount of the
          Credit Party Obligations (including the payment or cash
          collateralization of the outstanding LOC Obligations);

               FIFTH, to the payment of all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
          expenses (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of
          each of the Lenders in connection with enforcing its rights under the
          Credit Documents or otherwise with respect to the Credit Party
          Obligations owing to such Lender;

               SIXTH, to all other Credit Party Obligations and other
          obligations which shall have become due and payable under the Credit
          Documents or otherwise and not repaid pursuant to clauses "FIRST"
          through "FIFTH" above; and

               SEVENTH, to the payment of the surplus, if any, to whomever may
          be lawfully entitled to receive such surplus.

     In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
     numerical order provided until exhausted prior to application to the next
     succeeding category; (ii) each of the Lenders shall receive an amount equal
     to its pro rata share (based on the proportion that the then outstanding
     Loans and LOC Obligations held by such Lender bears to the

                                       51
<PAGE>

     aggregate then outstanding Loans and LOC Obligations) of amounts available
     to be applied pursuant to clauses "THIRD", "FOURTH", "FIFTH" and "SIXTH"
     above; and (iii) to the extent that any amounts available for distribution
     pursuant to clause "FIFTH" above are attributable to the issued but undrawn
     amount of outstanding Letters of Credit, such amounts shall be held by the
     Agent in a cash collateral account and applied (A) first, to reimburse the
     Issuing Lender from time to time for any drawings under such Letters of
     Credit and (B) then, following the expiration of all Letters of Credit, to
     all other obligations of the types described in clauses "FIFTH" and "SIXTH"
     above in the manner provided in this Section 3.15(b).

          3.16  Evidence of Debt.
                ----------------

          (a) Each Lender shall maintain an account or accounts evidencing each
     Loan made by such Lender to the Borrower from time to time, including the
     amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time
     to time under this Credit Agreement. Each Lender will make reasonable
     efforts to maintain the accuracy of its account or accounts and to promptly
     update its account or accounts from time to time, as necessary.

          (b) The Agent shall maintain the Register pursuant to Section 11.3(c),
     and a subaccount for each Lender, in which Register and subaccounts (taken
     together) shall be recorded (i) the amount, type and Interest Period of
     each such Loan hereunder, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due
     and payable or to become due and payable to each Lender hereunder and (iii)
     the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from or for the
     account of any Credit Party and each Lender's share thereof. The Agent will
     make reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy of the subaccounts
     referred to in the preceding sentence and to promptly update such
     subaccounts from time to time, as necessary.

          (c) The entries made in the accounts, Register and subaccounts
     maintained pursuant to clause (b) of this Section 3.16 (and, if consistent
     with the entries of the Agent, clause (a)) shall be prima facie evidence of
     the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Credit Parties therein
     recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the Agent to
               --------  -------
     maintain any such account, such Register or such subaccount, as applicable,
     or any error therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the
     Credit Parties to repay the Credit Party Obligations owing to such Lender.

          3.17  Replacement of Affected Lenders.
                -------------------------------

          If (i) any Lender having a Revolving Commitment becomes a Defaulting
     Lender or otherwise defaults in its Revolving Commitment or (ii) any Credit
     Party is required to make any payments to any Lender under Section 3.6,
     Section 3.9 or Section 3.11 in excess of the proportionate amount (based on
     the respective Commitments and/or Loans of the Lenders) of corresponding
     payments required to be made to the other Lenders, the Borrower shall have
     the right, if no Event of Default then exists, to replace such Lender (the
     "Replaced Lender") with one or more other Eligible Assignee or Eligible
      ---------------
     Assignees, none of whom shall constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of
     such replacement (collectively, the "Replacement Lender"), provided that
                                          ------------------    --------
     (a) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section 3.17, the
     Replaced

                                       52
<PAGE>

Lender and Replacement Lender shall enter into an Assignment and Acceptance
pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all or a portion, as the
case may be, of the Commitments and outstanding Loans of, and participation in
Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Lender and (b) all obligations of the
Borrower owing to the Replaced Lender relating to the Loans so replaced
(including, without limitation, such increased costs and excluding those
specifically described in clause (a) above in respect of which the assignment
purchase price has been, or is concurrently being paid) shall be paid in full to
such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of
the appropriate Assignment and Acceptance, the payment of amounts referred to in
clauses (a) and (b) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender,
delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes executed by
the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder with respect to
such replaced Loans, except with respect to indemnification provisions under
this Credit Agreement, which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, (1) the Lender that
acts as the Issuing Lender may not be replaced hereunder at any time that it has
Letters of Credit outstanding hereunder unless arrangements satisfactory to the
Issuing Lender (including the furnishing of a back-up standby letter of credit
in form and substance, and issued by an issuer satisfactory to such Issuing
Lender or the depositing of cash collateral into a cash collateral account
maintained with the Agent in amounts and pursuant to arrangements satisfactory
to such Issuing Lender) have been made with respect to such outstanding Letters
of Credit and (2) the Lender that acts as the Agent may not be replaced
hereunder except in accordance with the terms of Section 10.9. The Replaced
Lender shall be required to deliver for cancellation its applicable Notes to be
canceled on the date of replacement, or if any such Note is lost or unavailable,
such other assurances or indemnification therefor as the Borrower may reasonably
request.

                                   SECTION 4

                                   GUARANTY
                                   --------

          4.1  The Guaranty.
               ------------

     Each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally guarantees to each
Lender, each Affiliate of a Lender that enters into a Hedging Agreement, and the
Agent as hereinafter provided, as primary obligor and not as surety, the prompt
payment of the Credit Party Obligations in full when due (whether at stated
maturity, as a mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash
collateralization or otherwise) strictly in accordance with the terms thereof.
The Guarantors hereby further agree that if any of the Credit Party Obligations
are not paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity, as a mandatory
prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise), the Guarantors will, jointly and severally, promptly pay the same,
without any demand or notice whatsoever, and that in the case of any extension
of time of payment or renewal of any of the Credit Party Obligations, the same
will be promptly paid in full when due (whether at extended maturity, as a
mandatory prepayment, by acceleration, as a mandatory cash collateralization or
otherwise) in accordance with the terms of such extension or renewal.

                                       53
<PAGE>

     Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein or in any
other of the Credit Documents or Hedging Agreements, the obligations of each
Guarantor under this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render
such obligations subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code
or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law.

          4.2  Obligations Unconditional.
               -------------------------

     The obligations of the Guarantors under Section 4.1 are joint and several,
absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the value, genuineness, validity,
regularity or enforceability of any of the Credit Documents or Hedging
Agreements, or any other agreement or instrument referred to therein, or any
substitution, release, impairment or exchange of any other guarantee of or
security for any of the Credit Party Obligations, and, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, irrespective of any other circumstance whatsoever
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
surety or guarantor, it being the intent of this Section 4.2 that the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional
under any and all circumstances. Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall
have no right of subrogation, indemnity, reimbursement or contribution against
the Borrower or any other Guarantor for amounts paid under this Section 4 until
such time as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is agreed that, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the occurrence of any one or more of the following
shall not alter or impair the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which shall
remain absolute and unconditional as described above:

          (a)  at any time or from time to time, without notice to any
     Guarantor, the time for any performance of or compliance with any of the
     Credit Party Obligations shall be extended, or such performance or
     compliance shall be waived;

          (b)  any of the acts mentioned in any of the provisions of any of the
     Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and
     any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or
     instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements
     shall be done or omitted;

          (c)  the maturity of any of the Credit Party Obligations shall
     be accelerated, or any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be modified,
     supplemented or amended in any respect, or any right under any of the
     Credit Documents, any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and
     any Lender, or any Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or
     instrument referred to in the Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements
     shall be waived or any other guarantee of any of the Credit Party
     Obligations or any security therefor shall be released, impaired or
     exchanged in whole or in part or otherwise dealt with;

          (d)  any Lien granted to, or in favor of, the Agent or any Lender or
     Lenders as security for any of the Credit Party Obligations shall fail to
     attach or be perfected; or

          (e)  any of the Credit Party Obligations shall be determined to be
     void or voidable (including, without limitation, for the benefit of any
     creditor of any Guarantor) or

                                       54
<PAGE>

     shall be subordinated to the claims of any Person (including, without
     limitation, any creditor of any Guarantor).

With respect to its obligations hereunder, each Guarantor hereby expressly
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, protest and all notices
whatsoever, and any requirement that the Agent or any Lender exhaust any right,
power or remedy or proceed against any Person under any of the Credit Documents,
any Hedging Agreement between any Consolidated Party and any Lender, or any
Affiliate of a Lender, or any other agreement or instrument referred to in the
Credit Documents or such Hedging Agreements, or against any other Person under
any other guarantee of, or security for, any of the Credit Party Obligations.

          4.3  Reinstatement.
               -------------

     The obligations of the Guarantors under this Section 4 shall be
automatically reinstated if and to the extent that for any reason any payment by
or on behalf of any Person in respect of the Credit Party Obligations is
rescinded or must be otherwise restored by any holder of any of the Credit Party
Obligations, whether as a result of any proceedings in bankruptcy or
reorganization or otherwise, and each Guarantor agrees that it will indemnify
the Agent and each Lender on demand for all reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, fees and expenses of counsel) incurred by the
Agent or such Lender in connection with such rescission or restoration,
including any such costs and expenses incurred in defending against any claim
alleging that such payment constituted a preference, fraudulent transfer or
similar payment under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law.

          4.4  Certain Additional Waivers.
               --------------------------

     Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor shall have no right of recourse
to security for the Credit Party Obligations, except through the exercise of
rights of subrogation pursuant to Section 4.2 and through the exercise of rights
of contribution pursuant to Section 4.6.

          4.5  Remedies.
               --------

     The Guarantors agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as
between the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agent and the Lenders, on the
other hand, the Credit Party Obligations may be declared to be forthwith due and
payable as provided in Section 9.2 (and shall be deemed to have become
automatically due and payable in the circumstances provided in said Section 9.2)
for purposes of Section 4.1 notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other
prohibition preventing such declaration (or preventing the Credit Party
Obligations from becoming automatically due and payable) as against any other
Person and that, in the event of such declaration (or the Credit Party
Obligations being deemed to have become automatically due and payable), the
Credit Party Obligations (whether or not due and payable by any other Person)
shall forthwith become due and payable by the Guarantors for purposes of Section
4.1. The Guarantors acknowledge and agree that their obligations hereunder are
secured in accordance with the terms of the Collateral Documents and that the
Lenders may exercise their remedies thereunder in accordance with the terms
thereof.

<PAGE>

          4.6  Rights of Contribution.
               ----------------------

     The Guarantors hereby agree as among themselves that, if any Guarantor
shall make an Excess Payment (as defined below), such Guarantor shall have a
right of contribution from each other Guarantor in an amount equal to such other
Guarantor's Contribution Share (as defined below) of such Excess Payment. The
payment obligations of any Guarantor under this Section 4.6 shall be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the Credit Party Obligations until such time
as the Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied, and none of the
Guarantors shall exercise any right or remedy under this Section 4.6 against any
other Guarantor until such Credit Party Obligations have been Fully Satisfied.
For purposes of this Section 4.6, (a) "Excess Payment" shall mean the amount
                                       --------------
paid by any Guarantor in excess of its Pro Rata Share of any Guaranteed
Obligations; (b) "Pro Rata Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in respect of
                  --------------
any payment of Credit Party Obligations, the ratio (expressed as a percentage)
as of the date of such payment of Guaranteed Obligations of (i) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and
properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all assets and other
properties of all of the Credit Parties exceeds the amount of all of the debts
and liabilities (including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated
liabilities, but excluding the obligations of the Credit Parties hereunder) of
the Credit Parties; provided, however, that, for purposes of calculating the Pro
                    --------  -------
Rata Shares of the Guarantors in respect of any payment of Credit Party
Obligations, any Guarantor that became a Guarantor subsequent to the date of any
such payment shall be deemed to have been a Guarantor on the date of such
payment and the financial information for such Guarantor as of the date such
Guarantor became a Guarantor shall be utilized for such Guarantor in connection
with such payment; and (c) "Contribution Share" shall mean, for any Guarantor in
                            ------------------
respect of any Excess Payment made by any other Guarantor, the ratio (expressed
as a percentage) as of the date of such Excess Payment of (i) the amount by
which the aggregate present fair salable value of all of its assets and
properties exceeds the amount of all debts and liabilities of such Guarantor
(including contingent, subordinated, unmatured, and unliquidated liabilities,
but excluding the obligations of such Guarantor hereunder) to (ii) the amount by

     ERISA Affiliate to any liability under Sections 406, 409, 502(i), or 502(l)
     of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or under any agreement or other
     instrument pursuant to which any Consolidated Party or any ERISA Affiliate
     has agreed or is required to indemnify any Person against any such
     liability.

          (e)  Neither any Consolidated Party nor any ERISA Affiliates has any
     material liability with respect to "expected post-retirement benefit
     obligations" within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
     Statement 106. Each Plan which is a welfare plan (as defined in Section
     3(1) of ERISA) to which Sections 601-609 of ERISA and Section 4980B of the

     pursuant to Section 4975 of the Code. The representation by the Credit
     Parties in the preceding sentence is made in reliance upon and subject to
     the accuracy of the Lenders' representation in Section 11.15 with respect
     to their source of funds and is subject, in the event that the source of
     the funds used by the Lenders in connection with this transaction is an
     insurance company's general asset account, to the application of Prohibited
     Transaction Class Exemption 95-60, 60 Fed. Reg. 35,925 (1995), compliance
     with the regulations issued under Section 401(c)(1)(A) of ERISA, or the
     issuance of any other prohibited transaction exemption or similar relief,
     to the effect that assets in an insurance company's general asset account
     do not constitute assets of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
     of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section
     4975(e)(1) of the Code.

being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and as to which
adequate reserves therefor have been established in accordance with GAAP, unless

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          7.6  Insurance.
               ---------

          (a)  Each Credit Party will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries

     the related Property) or (ii) prepay the Loans (and cash collateralize LOC
     Obligations) in accordance with the terms of Section 3.3(b)(ii)(B);
     provided, however, that such Person shall not undertake replacement or
     restoration of such Property unless, after giving pro forma effect to any

     restoration, the Credit Parties would be in compliance with the financial
     covenants set forth in Section 7.10(a)-(c) as of the most recent fiscal

     purposes hereof, that such Funded Indebtedness was incurred as of the first
     day of the four fiscal-quarter period ending as of such fiscal quarter
     end). All insurance proceeds shall be subject to the security interest of
     the Agent (for the ratable benefit of the Lenders and the other secured
     parties referred to in the applicable Collateral Documents) under the
     Collateral Documents. Pending final application of any Excess Proceeds, the

          10.1   Appointment and Authorization of Agent.
                 --------------------------------------

     Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are

     other Credit Document, together with such powers as are reasonably
     incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained

     against the Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
     sentence, the use of the term "Agent" herein and in the other Credit
     Documents with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any
     fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
     doctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a
     matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an
     administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

          (b)    The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with
     respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated
     therewith until such time (and except for so long) as the Agent may agree
     at the request of the Required Lenders to act for the Issuing Lender with
     respect thereto; provided, however, that the Issuing Lender shall have all
                      --------  -------

<PAGE>

     with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the
     application and agreements for letters of credit pertaining to the Letters
     of Credit as fully as if the term "Agent" as used in this Section 10
     included the Issuing Lender with respect to such acts or omissions, and
     (ii) as additionally provided herein with respect to the Issuing Lender.

          10.2   Delegation of Duties.
                 --------------------

     The Agent may execute any of its duties under this Credit Agreement or any
other Credit Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel and other consultants or experts
concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agent or attorney-in-fact
that it selects in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct.

          10.3   Liability of Agent.
                 ------------------

     No Agent-Related Person shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Credit Agreement or
any other Credit Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with its duties
expressly set forth herein), or (b) be responsible in any manner to any Lender
or participant for any recital, statement, representation or warranty made by
any Credit Party or any officer thereof, contained herein or in any other Credit
Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection with, this
Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Credit Agreement or any other
Credit Document, or for any failure of any Credit Party or any other party to
any Credit Document to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No
Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender or participant
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Credit Agreement or any other
Credit Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of any Credit
Party or any Affiliate thereof.

          10.4   Reliance by Agent.
                 -----------------

          (a)    The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
     protected in relying, upon any writing, communication, signature,
     resolution, representation, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
     letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message, statement or other
     document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to
     have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons, and upon
     advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to any Credit
     Party), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent.
     The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
     action under any Credit Document unless it shall first receive such advice
     or concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
     so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
     Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by
     it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent
     shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
     acting, under this Credit Agreement or any other Credit Document in
     accordance with a

                                       94
<PAGE>

     request or consent of the Required Lenders or all the Lenders, if required
     hereunder, and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant
     thereto shall be binding upon all the Lenders and participants. Where this
     Credit Agreement expressly permits or prohibits an action unless the
     Required Lenders otherwise determine, the Agent shall, and in all other
     instances, the Agent may, but shall not be required to, initiate any
     solicitation for the consent or a vote of the Lenders.

          (b)    For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
     specified in Section 5.1, each Lender that has signed this Credit Agreement
     shall be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be
     satisfied with, each document or other matter either sent by the Agent to
     such Lender for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required
     thereunder to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory
     to a Lender.

          10.5   Notice of Default.
                 -----------------

     The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the Agent for the
account of the Lenders, unless the Agent shall have received written notice from
a Lender or the Borrower referring to this Credit Agreement, describing such
Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of
default". The Agent will notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice.
The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as may be directed by the Required Lenders in accordance with Section
9.2; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has received any such
     --------  -------
direction, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.

          10.6   Credit Decision; Disclosure of Information by Agent.
                 ---------------------------------------------------

     Each Lender acknowledges that no Agent-Related Person has made any
representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent hereinafter
taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of
the affairs of any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any
Lender as to any matter, including whether Agent-Related Persons have disclosed
material information in their possession. Each Lender represents to the Agent
that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Credit
Parties and their respective Subsidiaries, and all applicable Requirements of
Law relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision
to enter into this Credit Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower
hereunder. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems

                                       95
<PAGE>

necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and the other
Credit Parties. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly
required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent herein, the Agent shall not
have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Credit Parties or any of
their respective Affiliates which may come into the possession of any Agent-
Related Person.

          10.7   Indemnification of Agent.
                 ------------------------

     Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the
Lenders shall indemnify upon demand each Agent-Related Person (to the extent not
reimbursed by or on behalf of any Credit Party and without limiting the
obligation of any Credit Party to do so), pro rata, and hold harmless each
Agent-Related Person from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees) that may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any
Agent-Related Person, in each case arising out of or in connection with or by
reason of (including, without limitation, in connection with any investigation,
litigation, or proceeding or preparation of defense in connection therewith) the
Credit Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or
proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans, except to the extent such claim,
damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense is found in a final, non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent-
Related Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct; provided, however, that
                                                         --------  -------
no action taken in accordance with the directions of the Required Lenders shall
be deemed to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct for purposes of
this Section. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse
the Agent upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and the allocated costs of
internal counsel) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Credit Agreement,
any other Credit Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to
herein, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or
on behalf of the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive
termination of the Commitments, the payment of all Credit Party Obligations
hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

          10.8   Agent in its Individual Capacity.
                 --------------------------------

     Bank of America and its Affiliates may make loans to, issue letters of
credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire equity interests in and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with each of the Credit Parties and their respective
Affiliates as though Bank of America were not the Agent or the Issuing Lender
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America or its Affiliates
may receive information regarding any Credit Party or its Affiliates (including
information that may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of such
Credit Party or such Affiliate) and acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no
obligation to provide such information to them. With respect to its

                                       96
<PAGE>

Loans, Bank of America shall have the same rights and powers under this Credit
Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though
it were not the Agent or the Issuing Lender, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" include Bank of America in its individual capacity.

          10.9   Successor Agent.
                 ---------------

     The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If the
Agent resigns under this Credit Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint
from among the Lenders a successor administrative agent for the Lenders which
successor administrative agent shall be consented to by the Borrower at all
times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of
the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). If no successor
administrative agent is appointed prior to the effective date of the resignation
of the Agent, the Agent may appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the
Borrower, a successor administrative agent from among the Lenders. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as successor administrative agent hereunder, such
successor administrative agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
administrative agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as
Agent shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as
Agent, the provisions of this Section 10 and Sections 11.4 and 11.9 shall inure
to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Agent under this Credit Agreement. If no successor administrative agent has
accepted appointment as Agent by the date which is 30 days following a retiring
Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Agent's resignation shall
nevertheless thereupon become effective and the Lenders shall perform all of the
duties of the Agent hereunder until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor agent as provided for above.

          10.10  Other Agents; Lead Managers.
                 ---------------------------

     None of the Lenders identified on the facing page or signature pages of
this Credit Agreement as a "syndication agent", "documentation agent", "co-
agent" or "lead arranger" shall have any right, power, obligation, liability,
responsibility or duty under this Credit Agreement other than those applicable
to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Lenders so
identified shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on
any of the Lenders so identified in deciding to enter into this Credit Agreement
or in taking or not taking action hereunder.

               11.2    Right of Set-Off; Adjustments.
                       -----------------------------

               Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, each Lender (and each of its Affiliates) is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off
and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional
or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such
Lender (or any of its Affiliates) to or for the credit or the account of any
Credit Party against any and all of the obligations of such Person now or
hereafter existing under this Credit Agreement, under the Notes, under any other
Credit Document or otherwise, irrespective of whether such Lender shall have
made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may be
unmatured. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify any affected Credit Party after
any such set-off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that
                                                      --------  -------
the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off
and application. The rights of each

                                       99
<PAGE>

Lender under this Section 11.2 are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) that such Lender may
have.

          11.3   Successors and Assigns.
                 ----------------------

          (a)    The provisions of this Credit Agreement shall be binding upon
     and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
     successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that none of the Credit
     Parties may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
     hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any
     attempted assignment or transfer by any Credit Party without such consent
     shall be null and void). Nothing in this Credit Agreement, expressed or
     implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the
     parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby
     and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Indemnified Parties)
     any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
     Credit Agreement.

          (b)    Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or
     a portion of its rights and obligations under this Credit Agreement
     (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans (including for
     purposes of this subsection (b), its Participation Interests) at the time
     owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case of an assignment of the
                   --------
     entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment and the Loans
     at the time owing to it or in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an
     Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to a Lender, the
     aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
     outstanding thereunder) or principal outstanding balance of the Term Loan
     of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of
     the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment is
     delivered to the Agent, shall not be less than $5,000,000 in the case of
     any assignment of a Revolving Commitment, or $1,000,000, in the case of any
     assignment of a Term Loan, unless each of the Agent and, so long as no
     Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
     otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
     delayed), (ii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
     proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
     under this Credit Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitments
     assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from
     assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among separate
     tranches on a non pro rata basis, and (iii) the parties to each assignment
     shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
     together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to
     acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to subsection (c),
     from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
     Acceptance, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
     to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance,
     have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Credit Agreement,
     and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
     assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
     obligations under this Credit Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment
     and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and
     obligations under this Credit Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a
     party hereto but

                                      100
<PAGE>

     shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.11, 3.12 and
     11.5). Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
     deliver new or replacement Notes to the assigning Lender and the assignee
     Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
     under this Credit Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall
     be treated for purposes of this Credit Agreement as a sale by such Lender
     of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
     subsection (d) of this Section.

          (c)  The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
     Borrower, shall maintain at is address referred to in Section 11.1 a copy
     of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
     recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments
     of, and principal amount of the Loans and LOC Obligations owing to, each
     Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The
                                                                 --------
     entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the
     Credit Parties, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name
     is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
     hereunder for all purposes of this Credit Agreement, notwithstanding notice
     to the contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the
     Credit Parties and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time
     upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the
     Credit Parties or the Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or
     other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's
                        -----------
     rights and/or obligations under this Credit Agreement (including all or a
     portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans (including such Lender's
     Participation Interests) owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender's
                                            --------
     obligations under this Credit Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
     Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
     performance of such obligations and (iii) the Credit Parties, the Agent and
     the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
     Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this
     Credit Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender
     sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
     sole right to enforce this Credit Agreement and to approve any amendment,
     modification or waiver of any provision of this Credit Agreement; provided
                                                                       --------
     that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not,
     without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, waiver or
     other modification that would (i) postpone any date upon which any payment
     of money is scheduled to be paid to such Participant, (ii) reduce the
     principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable to such Participant,
     (iii) except as the result of or in connection with a dissolution, merger
     or disposition of a Consolidated Party not prohibited by Section 8.4 or
     8.5, release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their
     obligations under the Credit Documents or (iv) except as the result of or
     in connection with an Asset Disposition not prohibited by Section 8.5,
     release all or substantially all of the Collateral. Subject to subsection
     (e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
     entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.6, 3.9, 3.11 and 3.12 to the same
     extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
     pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law,
     each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.2 as
     though it were a

                                      101
<PAGE>

     Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.14 as
             --------
     though it were a Lender.

          (e)  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
     payment under Section 3.6, 3.7 or 3.11 than the applicable Lender would
     have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to
     such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant
     is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that is
     not a United States person under Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall not
     be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.11 unless the Borrower is notified
     of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees,
     for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 3.11(d) as though
     it were a Lender.

          (f)  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest
     in all or any portion of its rights under this Credit Agreement (including
     under its Notes, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including
     any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank;
     provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release a Lender from any
     --------
     of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for
     such Lender as a party hereto.

          (g)  If the consent of the Borrower to an assignment or to an Eligible
     Assignee is required hereunder (including a consent to an assignment which
     does not meet the minimum assignment threshold specified in clause (i) of
     the proviso to the first sentence of Section 11.3(b)), the Borrower shall
     be deemed to have given its consent five Business Days after the date
     notice thereof has been delivered by the assigning Lender (through the
     Agent) unless such consent is expressly refused by the Borrower prior to
     such fifth Business Day.

          (h)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if at
     any time Bank of America assigns all of its Commitment and Loans pursuant
     to subsection (b) above, Bank of America may, upon 30 days' notice to the
     Borrower and the Lenders, resign as Issuing Lender. In the event of any
     such resignation as Issuing Lender, the Borrower shall be entitled to
     appoint from among the Lenders a successor Issuing Lender hereunder
     (subject to the consent of such Lender so appointed); provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
     that no failure by the Borrower to appoint any such successor shall affect
     the resignation of Bank of America as Issuing Lender. Bank of America shall
     retain all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Lender hereunder with
     respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding as of the effective date of
     its resignation as Issuing Lender and all LOC Obligations with respect
     thereto (including the right to require the Lenders to make Revolving Loans
     or fund their Participation Interests pursuant to Section 2.2).

          (i)  (i)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
          any Lender (a "Designating Lender") may grant to one or more special
                         ------------------
          purpose funding vehicles (each, an "SPV"), identified as such in
                                              ---
          writing from time to time by the Designating Lender to the Agent and
          the Borrower, the option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of
          any Loan that such Designating Lender would otherwise be obligated to
          make to the Borrower pursuant to this Credit

                                      102
<PAGE>

          Agreement; provided that (A) nothing herein shall constitute a
          commitment by any SPV to make any Loan, (B) if an SPV elects not to
          exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of
          such Loan, the Designating Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan
          pursuant to the terms hereof, (C) the Designating Lender shall remain
          liable for any indemnity or other payment obligation with respect to
          its Commitments hereunder and (D) each such SPV would satisfy the
          requirements of Section 3.11 if such SPV was a Lender hereunder. The
          making of a Loan by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of
          the Designating Lender to the same extent as a Loan made by, and as if
          such Loan were made by, such Designating Lender.

               (ii)  As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each SPV
          shall have all the rights that a Lender making such Loans or portion
          thereof would have had under this Credit Agreement; provided, however
          that each SPV shall have granted to its Designating Lender an
          irrevocable power of attorney, to deliver and receive all
          communications and notices under this Agreement (and any related
          documents), including, without limitation, any Notice of Borrowing and
          any Notice of Extension/Conversion, and to exercise on such SPV's
          behalf, all of such SPV's voting rights under this Credit Agreement.
          No additional Note shall be required to evidence the Loans or portion
          thereof made by an SPV; and the related Designating Lender shall be
          deemed to hold its Note as agent for such SPV to the extent of the
          Loans or portion thereof funded by such SPV. In addition, any payments
          for the account of any SPV shall be paid to its Designating Lender as
          agent for such SPV.

               (iii) Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable
          for any indemnity or payment under this Credit Agreement for which a
          Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent,
          the Designating Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment.
          In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees
          (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Credit
          Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after
          the payment in full of all outstanding prior indebtedness of any SPV,
          it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting
          against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement,
          insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the
          laws of the United States or any State thereof.

               (iv)  In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
          contained in this Section 11.3 or otherwise in this Credit Agreement,
          any SPV may (A) at any time and without paying any processing fee
          therefor, assign or participate all or a portion of its interest in
          any Loans to the Designating Lender (or to any other SPV of such
          Designating Lender) or to any financial institutions providing
          liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV
          to support the funding or maintenance of Loans and (B) disclose on a
          confidential basis any non-public information relating to its Loans to
          any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety,
          guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancements to such SPV.

          This Section 11.3 may not be amended without the written consent of
          any Designating Lender affected thereby.

          11.4  No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
                ------------------------------

     No failure or delay on the part of the Agent or any Lender in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit Document and
no course of dealing between the Agent or any Lender and any of the Credit
Parties shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other Credit
Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies
provided herein are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any
Credit Party in any case shall entitle the Credit Parties to any other or
further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances or constitute a
waiver of the rights of the Agent or the Lenders to any other or further action
in any circumstances without notice or demand.

          11.5  Expenses; Indemnification.
                -------------------------

          (a)  The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to pay on demand
     all costs and expenses of the Agent in connection with the syndication,
     preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, and
     amendment of this Credit Agreement, the other Credit Documents, and the
     other documents to be delivered hereunder, including, without limitation,
     the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Agent (including the
     cost of internal counsel) with respect thereto and with respect to advising
     the Agent as to its rights and responsibilities under the Credit Documents.
     The Credit Parties further jointly and severally agree to pay on demand all
     costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders, if any (including, without
     limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and the cost of
     internal counsel), in connection with any work-out or restructuring
     relating to the Credit Facilities or any enforcement (whether through
     negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of any of the Credit
     Documents.

          (b)  The Credit Parties jointly and severally agree to indemnify and
     hold harmless each Agent-Related Person and each Lender and each of their
     Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
     trustees and advisors (each, an "Indemnified Party") from and against any
     and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses
     (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) that may be
     incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Party, in each
                                                    -----------------
     case arising out of or in connection with or by reason of (including,
     without limitation, in connection with any investigation, litigation, or
     proceeding or preparation of defense in connection therewith) the Credit
     Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the actual or
     proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans, except to the extent such claim,
     damage, loss, liability, cost, or expense is found in a final, non-
     appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
     from such Indemnified Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. In
     the case of an investigation, litigation or other proceeding to which the
     indemnity in this Section 11.5 applies, such indemnity shall be effective
     whether or not such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by
     any of

                                      104
<PAGE>

     the Credit Parties, their respective directors, shareholders or creditors
     or an Indemnified Party or any other Person or any Indemnified Party is
     otherwise a party thereto and whether or not the transactions contemplated
     hereby are consummated. The Credit Parties agree not to assert any claim
     against any Agent-Related Party, any Lender, any of their Affiliates, or
     any of their respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys, agents,
     and advisers, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
     consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating to
     the Credit Documents, any of the transactions contemplated herein or the
     actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Loans.

          (c)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
     Credit Parties hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Credit
     Parties contained in this Section 11.5 shall survive the repayment of the
     Credit Party Obligations and the termination of the Commitments hereunder.
