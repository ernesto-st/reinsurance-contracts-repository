</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;The Borrower has requested that the Lender establish a $138,875,000

this Agreement and a $0 Base Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;To secure the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement and the

shall create a Collateral Pool in favor of the Lender. The Collateral Pool shall

Lender may recover an amount equal to the full amount outstanding in respect of
any of the Notes in connection with such exercise and any such amount shall be
applied as determined by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion.

Collateral Pool, the Borrower may deliver a written request for the release of
Collateral from the Collateral Pool (&#147;<U>Collateral Release Request&#148;</U>) to the
Lender, in the form attached as Exhibit&nbsp;T to this Agreement. The Collateral
Release Request shall not result in a termination of all or any part of the
Credit Facility. The Borrower may only terminate all or any part of the Credit
Facility by delivering a Revolving Facility Termination Request or Credit
Facility Termination Request pursuant to Articles IX or X. The Collateral
Release Request shall be accompanied by (and shall not be effective unless it is
accompanied by) the name, address and location of the Mortgaged Property to be
released from the Collateral Pool (&#147;<U>Collateral Release Property&#148;</U>).

from the Collateral Pool, at a closing to be held at offices designated by the
Lender on a Closing Date selected by the Lender, and occurring within 30&nbsp;days
after the Lender&#146;s receipt of the Collateral Release Request (or on such other
date to which the Borrower and the Lender may agree, provided that in any
Calendar Quarter, the Closing Date for any release shall be on the same day as
the Closing Date of any addition of an Additional Mortgaged Property to the
Collateral Pool pursuant to Article&nbsp;VI of this Agreement or any increase in the
Credit Facility pursuant to Article&nbsp;VIII of this Agreement), by executing and
delivering, and causing all applicable parties to execute and deliver, all at
the sole cost and expense of the Borrower, instruments, in the form customarily

Advance). Any portion of the Release Price held as Substituted Cash Collateral
may be released if, immediately after giving effect to the release, each of the
conditions set forth in Section&nbsp;7.03(a) below shall have been satisfied. If, on
the date on which the Borrower pays the Release Price, Revolving Advances are
Outstanding but are not then due and payable, the Lender shall hold the payments

of the most recent of such financial statements no event has occurred which
would have, or may reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and
there has not been any material transaction entered into by the Borrower other
