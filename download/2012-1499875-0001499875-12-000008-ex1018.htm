Tax), levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory loans, restrictions or conditions of any nature
now or hereafter imposed or levied by any jurisdiction or any political subdivision thereof or taxing or other authority therein
unless the Borrower is compelled by law to make such deduction or withholding. If any such obligation is imposed upon the Borrower
with respect to any amount payable by it hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, the Borrower will pay to the Agent,
for the account of the Lenders (including the Swing Loan Lender) or (as the case may be) the Agent, on the date on which such amount
is due and payable hereunder or under such other Loan Document, such additional amount in Dollars as shall be necessary to enable
the Lenders or the Agent to receive the same net amount which the Lenders or the Agent would have received on such due date had
no such obligation been imposed upon the Borrower. If any such Lender, to the extent it may lawfully do so, fails to deliver the
above forms or other documentation, then the Agent may withhold from any payments to be made to such Lender under any of the Loan
Documents such amounts as are required by the Code. If any Governmental Authority asserts that the Agent or the Borrower (as to
the Borrower, with respect to Excluded FATCA Taxes only) did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any
tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of any Lender, such Lender shall indemnify the Agent and/or the Borrower
(as to the Borrower, with respect to Excluded FATCA Taxes only) therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed
by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent or by the Borrower (as to the Borrower, with respect to Excluded FATCA
Taxes only) under this &sect;4.3, and costs and expenses (including all reasonable fees and disbursements of any law firm or other
external counsel and the allocated cost of internal legal services and all disbursements of internal counsel) of the Agent and
the Borrower (as to the Borrower, with respect to Excluded FATCA Taxes only). The obligation of the Lenders under this &sect;4.3(b)
shall survive the termination of the Commitments, repayment of all Obligations and all the resignation or replacement of the Agent.
Without limitation of this &sect;4.3(b), if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to United States
federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting and document provision
requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1741(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by either,
such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional
documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower and/or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply
with their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender obligations under FATCA
and, as necessary, to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. The Borrower will deliver promptly to the
Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for all taxes or other charges deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by
the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document.</P>

have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which
by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the applicable Lenders
other than Defaulting Lenders, except that the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased without the consent of
such Lender. The Borrower agrees to enter into such modifications or amendments of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents as
reasonably may be requested by KeyBank and the Arranger in connection with the syndication of the Loan, <U>provided</U> that no
such amendment or modification materially affects or increases any of the obligations of the Borrower hereunder. No waiver shall
