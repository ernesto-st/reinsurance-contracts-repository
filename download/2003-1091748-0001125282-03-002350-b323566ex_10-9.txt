         8.6      Upon the request of the Settlor or the Beneficiary, the
                  Trustee shall promptly permit the Settlor or the Beneficiary,
                  their respective agents, employees or independent auditors to
                  examine, audit, excerpt, transcribe and copy, during the
                  Trustee's normal business hours, any books, documents, papers
                  and records relating to the Trust Fund or the Assets.

         8.7      The duties and obligations of the Trustee shall only be such
                  as are specifically set forth in this Trust Agreement, as it
                  may from time to time be amended, and no implied duties or
                  obligations shall be read into this Trust Agreement against
                  the Trustee. The Trustee shall be liable only for its own
                  negligence, wilful misconduct, dishonesty or fraud.

         8.8      No provision of this Trust Agreement shall require the Trustee
                  to take any action which, in the Trustee's reasonable
                  judgment, would result in any violation of this Trust
                  Agreement or any provision of law.

9.       Trustee's Remuneration

         9.1      The Trustee shall be entitled to remuneration for its services
                  in such amount and at such times as may from time to time be
                  agreed between the Trustee and the Beneficiary or, in default
                  of agreement, in accordance with its published terms and
                  conditions from time to time in force.

         9.2      The Beneficiary shall pay or reimburse the Trustee for all of
                  the Trustee's expenses and disbursements in connection with
                  its duties under this Trust Agreement (including reasonable
                  attorney's fees and expenses), except any such expense or
                  disbursement as may arise from the Trustee's negligence,
                  wilful misconduct, dishonesty or fraud.

10.      Indemnity

         10.1     The Beneficiary shall indemnify the Trustee for, and hold it
                  harmless against, any loss, liability, costs or expenses
                  (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses) (unless
                  the Settlor is the cause of such loss, liability, costs or
                  expenses including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses, in
                  which case the Settlor, and not the Beneficiary will indemnify
                  the Trustee), incurred without negligence, wilful misconduct,
                  dishonesty or fraud on the part of the Trustee, arising out of
                  or in connection with the performance of the Trustee's
                  obligations in accordance with the provisions of the Trust
                  Agreement, including any loss, liability, costs or expenses
                  arising out of or in connection with the status of the Trustee
                  and its authorized nominee as the holder of records of the
                  Assets. The Settlor and the Beneficiary acknowledge that the
                  foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation of the
                  Trustee or the termination of this Trust Agreement.
<PAGE>

         10.2     No Trustee shall be bound to take any proceedings against a
                  former trustee hereof for any breach or alleged breach of
                  trust committed or suffered by such former trustee.

11       Receipt of Income

         Unless the Trustee in its discretion shall otherwise determine, all
         Income received by the Trustee shall be treated for all purposes hereof
         as Income at the date of receipt, irrespective of the period in
         relation to which such Income shall have been earned.

12       Protection of Third Parties

         12.1     No person dealing with the Trustee and no purchaser on any
                  sale made by the Trustee shall be concerned to enquire into
                  the propriety or validity of any act of the Trustee or to see
                  to the application of any money paid or property transferred
                  to or upon the order of the Trustee;

         12.2     No company any of whose securities are comprised in the Trust
                  Fund and no purchaser or person dealing with any person
                  purporting to act under any delegation of authority from any
                  Trustee shall be required to ascertain or enquire whether a
                  case exists in which such delegation is permitted or whether
                  such delegated authority is still subsisting;

         12.3     When anything is dependent upon the value of any property or
                  the existence of any fact, the certificate of the Trustee as
                  to such value or fact shall be conclusive in favour of anyone
                  acting thereon in good faith.

13.      Trustee acting as Director etc. and Agent

         Any Trustee and, in particular, any corporate Trustee and any Parent,
         Subsidiary or Affiliate of such corporate Trustee may be appointed by
         the Trustee, subject to any requirements of this Trust Agreement, to
         undertake and transact any business or to do any act requiring to be
         transacted or done in the execution of the Trust hereof (in particular,
         without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, in exercise by
         the Trustee of the powers contained in Clause 7.1.10) and, in any such
         case, shall be entitled to charge and be paid and to retain for its own
         account all usual professional and other fees and commissions normally
         paid for such services in the ordinary course of business.
<PAGE>

14.      Overseeing Management of Companies

         The Trustee shall not be required to interfere in the management or
         conduct of the business of any company whose securities comprise the
         whole or part of the Trust Fund. Where the Trustee's holding of such
         securities is sufficient to confer voting control of such a company,
         the Trustee shall nevertheless from time to time use reasonable
         endeavours to obtain such information from the company as would be made
         available to a non-executive director in order to satisfy itself (as
         far as may be possible from such information) that the affairs of the
         company are being properly managed. In the absence of any notice to the
         contrary, the Trustee shall be at liberty to leave the conduct of the
         company's business, including the payment or non-payment of dividends,
         wholly to the company's directors. At the request of the Settlor and at
         its expense, the Trustee shall cooperate with the Settlor in obtaining
         information regarding property in the Trust Fund.

15.      Trustee's Discretion

         Except as otherwise expressly herein mentioned, every discretion or
         power hereby conferred upon the Trustee shall be an absolute and
         unfettered discretion or power and the Trustee shall not be obliged to
         give to any beneficiary any reason or justification for the exercise or
         non-exercise of any such discretion or power and no Trustee shall be
         held liable for any loss or damage occurring as a result of its
         concurring or refusing or failing to concur in any exercise or
         non-exercise of any such discretion or power.

16.      Notices

         Unless otherwise provided in this Trust Agreement, all notices,
         directions, requests, demands, acknowledgements and other
         communications required or permitted to be given or made under the

17.      Severability

         In the event that any provision of this Trust Agreement shall be
         declared invalid or unenforceable by any regulatory body or court
         having jurisdiction, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not
         affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of this
         Trust Agreement.

18.      Successors and Assigns

         Neither the Beneficiary nor the Settlor may assign this Trust Agreement
         nor any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior
         consent of the other party.

19.      Appointment and Retirement of Trustee

         19.1     The Trustee may resign at any time by giving not less than
                  ninety (90) calendar days written notice of such resignation
                  to the Beneficiary and to the Settlor. The Trustee may be
                  removed by the Settlor's and Beneficiary's joint agreement
                  (with any dispute being resolved under the aribitration
                  procedures as set out in Clause 24) and delivery of not less
                  than ninety (90) calendar days written notice of such removal
                  to the Trustee (which may be shortened by the Settlor and
                  Beneficiary if the Trustee has violated the standard of care
                  set forth in Clause 8.7); such resignation, subject to the
                  provisions of Clause 19.3 below, or removal, shall become
                  effective on or after the notice period upon (i) the
                  appointment of a successor trustee by the Settlor and the
                  Beneficiary (with any dispute being resolved under the
                  aribitration procedures as set out in Clause 24), (ii) the
                  acceptance of such appointment by the successor Trustee and
                  (iii) the transfer of all Assets in the Trust Fund to such
                  successor Trustee in accordance with Clause 19.2.
<PAGE>

         19.2     Any successor Trustee shall be a licensed trust company and
                  shall not be a Parent, Subsidiary or an Affiliate of the
                  Settlor or the Beneficiary. The successor Trustee shall
                  succeed and become vested with all the rights, powers,
                  privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Trustee, and
                  the resigning or removed Trustee shall be discharged from any
                  future duties and obligations under this Trust Agreement, but
                  the resigning or removed Trustee shall continue after such
                  resignation or removal to be entitled to the benefits of the
                  indemnities provided herein for the Trustee and subject to any
                  liability provided for herein while acting as Trustee
                  hereunder.

         19.3     If the Trustee has sought to resign in accordance with the
                  procedures outlined in Clause 19.1 above and the Settlor and
                  Beneficiary have not appointed a successor trustee within 120
                  days of the Trustee's notice, the Trustee shall have the power
                  to apply to the supreme court in Bermuda to be relieved of its
                  responsibilities and to have the Assets of the Trust Fund
                  transferred to such court. Upon approval by the court, the
                  resigned Trustee shall be discharged from any future duties
                  and obligations under this Trust Agreement, but the resigned
                  Trustee shall continue after such resignation to be entitled
                  to the benefits of the indemnities provided for herein for the
                  Trustee and subject to any liability provided for herein while
                  acting as Trustee hereunder.

20.      Settlor's Power to Change Proper Law and Forum

         20.1     The Settlor may, at any time and from time to time by deed,
                  change the Proper Law of this Trust to the law of some other
                  jurisdiction in any part of the world and, as from the date of
                  such deed, the law of the jurisdiction named therein shall be
                  the Proper Law of this Trust and the courts of that
                  jurisdiction shall be the forum for the administration
                  thereof, but subject to the powers conferred by this Clause
                  20.1 and until any further change is made hereunder, provided
                  that, notwithstanding anything herein contained, the Settlor
                  shall not exercise such power in any way which might directly
                  or indirectly result in this Trust becoming according to the
                  law applicable thereto illegal, void or voidable or which
                  might change the beneficial interests hereunder.
<PAGE>

         20.2     So often as any change of the Proper Law of this Trust shall
                  be made pursuant to the provisions of Clause 20.1, the Trustee
                  may at any time, either then or thereafter, by deed make such
                  alterations and additions to the trusts, powers and provisions
                  hereof as the Trustee may consider necessary or desirable to
                  ensure that, so far as may be possible, the trusts, powers and
                  provisions hereof shall, mutatis mutandis, be as valid and
                  effective as they were immediately prior to such change.

21.      Counterparts

         This Trust Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
         each of which when so executed and delivered shall constitute an
         original, but such counterparts together shall constitute but one and
         the same Trust Agreement.

22.      Power to Vary

         The parties hereto may, at any time and from time to time, by deed
         supplemental hereto, amend in whole or in part any or all of the
         provisions of this Trust Agreement whether to cure any ambiguity or to
         cure, correct or supplement any provision contained herein or in any
         supplemental deed or deeds or otherwise; provided that any such
         modification that alters or increases the duties or obligations of the
         Trustee shall not be binding upon the Trustee unless such modification
         has been accepted by the Trustee in writing.

23.      Termination of Trust

         23.1     The Trust Fund and this Trust Agreement, except for the
                  indemnities provided herein and the liability of the Trustee
                  for negligence, wilful misconduct, dishonesty or fraud, may be
                  terminated, except as provided in Clause 23.2, only after the
                  Settlor and the Beneficiary have given the Trustee written
                  notice of their joint intention to terminate the Trust (the
                  "Notice of Intention") (with any dispute being resolved under
                  the Aribitration procedures as outlined in Clause 24). The
                  Notice of Intention shall specify the date on which the
                  notifying Party intends the Trust to terminate which shall be
                  not less than 30 nor more than 45 calendar days after the date
                  of the Notice of Intention (the "Proposed Date").

         23.2     The Settlor alone may terminate this Trust Agreement without
                  diminishing the right of the Trustee to indemnity or the
                  Trustee's obligation for past conduct when all Obligations
                  have been satisfied, on notice to the Beneficiary and the
                  Trustee of the Termination Date which shall not be less than
                  30 nor more than 45 calendar days from the date of such notice
                  and subject to Clause 5.9.
<PAGE>

         23.3     On the Termination Date, the Trustee shall transfer to the
                  Settlor any Assets remaining in the Trust Fund, at which time
                  all liability of the Trustee with respect to such Assets shall
                  cease, except for the Trustee's liability for negligence,
                  wilful misconduct, dishonesty or fraud with respect thereto.

24.      Arbitration

         24.1     All matters in difference between the parties arising under,
                  out of or in connection with this Trust Agreement, shall be
                  referred to an arbitration tribunal in the manner hereinafter
                  set out.

         24.2     Unless the parties appoint a sole arbitrator within 14
                  calendar days of one receiving a written request from the
                  other for arbitration, the claimant (the party requesting
                  arbitration) shall appoint his arbitrator and give written
                  notice hereof to the respondent. Within 30 calendar days of
                  receiving such notice, the respondent shall appoint his
                  arbitrator and give written notice thereof to the claimant,
                  failing which the claimant may apply to the appointor
                  hereafter named to nominate an arbitrator on behalf of the
                  respondent.

         24.3     Before they enter upon a reference, the two arbitrators shall
                  appoint a third arbitrator. Should they fail to appoint such a
                  third arbitrator within 30 calendar days of the appointment of
                  the respondent's arbitrator, then either of them or either of
                  the parties may apply to the appointor for the appointment of
                  the third arbitrator. The three arbitrators shall decide by
                  majority. The third arbitrator shall also act as chairman of
                  the tribunal.

         24.4     Unless the parties otherwise agree the arbitration tribunal
                  shall consist of persons (including those who have retired)
                  with not less than ten years' experience of insurance or
                  reinsurance as persons engaged in the industry itself or as
                  lawyers or other professional advisers.

         24.5     The arbitration tribunal shall, so far as is permissible under
                  the law and practice of the place of arbitration, have power
                  to fix all procedural rules for the holding of the arbitration
                  including discretionary power to make orders as to any matters
                  which it may consider proper in the circumstances of the case
                  with regard to pleadings, discovery, inspection of the
                  documents, examination of witnesses and any other matter
                  whatsoever relating to the conduct of the arbitration and may
                  receive and act upon such evidence whether oral or written
                  strictly admissible or not as it shall in its discretion think
                  fit.

         24.6     The appointor shall be the Chairman for the time being of
                  Arias (UK) or if he is unavailable or it is inappropriate for
                  him to act for any reason, such persons as may be nominated by
                  the Committee of Arias (UK). If for any reason such persons
                  decline or are unable to act, then the appointor shall be the
                  nominating committee of the Chartered Institute of
                  Arbitrators, Bermuda Branch.
