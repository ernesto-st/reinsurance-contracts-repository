and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Buyer will pay to Cooper and
Cooper UK, in consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer of the Shares,
the aggregate sum of $1,157,500,000 in cash (in U.S. dollars) plus all Estimated
Cash and Cash Equivalents minus all Estimated Debt Obligations (as adjusted
pursuant to SECTION 2.3, the "PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE"). Such amount shall be
paid to the applicable Seller on the Closing Date by means of one or more wire
transfers of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in

jointly prepare and agree in good faith to a statement allocating the
Preliminary Purchase Price among the Shares sold by each Seller and the
non-competition and non-solicitation covenants contained herein (the "PURCHASE
PRICE ALLOCATION") in accordance with applicable Law. If the parties cannot
agree in good faith within the time period set forth above, then Cooper and
Buyer jointly shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute and
whose fees shall be borne equally by Cooper and Buyer. The determination by the
Arbitration Firm shall be binding on the parties. None of the Sellers, the Buyer

      the parties shall jointly agree to allocate such adjustment among the
      Shares sold by each Seller and the non-competition and non-solicitation
      covenants contained herein (the "ADJUSTED PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION"). If
      after good faith negotiations, the parties cannot agree upon the
      allocation of such adjustment among the Shares sold by each Seller and
      such non-competition and non-solicitation covenants within thirty (30)
      days after such adjustment was made, then Cooper and Buyer jointly shall
      engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute and whose fees shall
      be borne equally by Cooper and Buyer. The determination by the Arbitration
      Firm shall be binding on the parties. None of the Sellers, the Buyer or
      their respective Affiliates shall take any position inconsistent with the
      Adjusted Purchase Price Allocation on any Tax Return or in any audit or
      other proceeding relating to Taxes unless otherwise required by Law.

            (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
any of the Sellers fails to provide the Buyer with the certification provided in

            2.3 ADJUSTMENT TO CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS.
Five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Cooper shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer (i) a statement (the "ESTIMATED CASH AND DEBT STATEMENT") of
(A) a good faith estimate of the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents anticipated
to exist immediately prior to the Closing (the "ESTIMATED CASH AND CASH
EQUIVALENTS"), and (B) a good faith estimate of the Debt Obligations of the Sold
Companies and the wholly-owned Subsidiaries and the Venture Entity and
Non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary Debt Obligations anticipated to be outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing ("ESTIMATED DEBT OBLIGATIONS") and (ii) a
statement reflecting a good faith estimate of the combined balance sheet of the
Business as of the Closing. The Estimated Cash and Debt Statement shall be
subject to the review of Buyer, and Cooper and the Buyer will cooperate and
negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding the Estimated Cash and
Debt Statement prior to the Closing; provided that if any item of dispute
regarding the Estimated Cash and Debt Statement is not resolved by agreement in
writing between Cooper and the Buyer two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, then Cooper's estimate of such disputed item together with the resolved
disputed items and the undisputed items contained in the Estimated Cash and Debt
Statement

                                       13
<PAGE>

shall be deemed final and shall be deemed the Estimated Cash and Cash
Equivalents and the Estimated Debt Obligations for purposes of SECTION 2.2(a).

            (b) Within 45 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
and deliver to Cooper a statement setting forth the Final Cash and Cash
Equivalents, the Final Debt Obligations and the Final Purchase Price (the "FINAL
CASH AND DEBT STATEMENT").

            (c) Within fifteen (15) days following receipt by Cooper of the
Final Cash and Debt Statement, Cooper shall deliver written notice to Buyer of
any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of the Final Cash
and Debt Statement. Such notice must describe in reasonable detail the items
contained in the Final Cash and Debt Statement that Cooper disputes and the
basis for any such disputes. If Cooper does not notify Buyer of a dispute with
respect to the Final Cash and Debt Statement within such 15-day period, such
Final Cash and Debt Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute, Cooper and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Cooper and Buyer,
notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within ten
(10) days after Cooper advises Buyer of its objections, then Cooper and Buyer
jointly shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute. As promptly
as practicable thereafter, Cooper and Buyer shall each prepare and submit a
written presentation to the Arbitration Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter,
Cooper and Buyer shall cause the Arbitration Firm to choose one of the party's
positions based solely upon the presentation by Cooper and Buyer. All fees and
expenses relating to this work of the Arbitration Firm shall be borne by the
party whose position was not selected by the Arbitration Firm. All
determinations made by the Arbitration Firm will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties.

            (d) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
SECTION 2.3, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other
parties and their respective representatives all information, records, data and
working papers, and shall permit reasonable access to its facilities and
personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the preparation and
analysis of the Final Cash and Debt Statement and the resolution of any disputes
thereunder.

            (e) If Final Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to
SECTION 2.3(c)) is less than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Cooper shall pay
Buyer by means of one or more wire transfers of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Buyer an amount in cash (in U.S.

Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date
of such payment). Such payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days of
the date on which Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to SECTION
2.3(c).

            (f) If Final Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to
SECTION 2.3(c)) is greater than the Preliminary Purchase Price, Buyer shall pay
Cooper by means of one or more wire transfers of immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated in writing by Cooper an amount in cash (in
U.S. dollars) equal to such excess (together with interest thereon at the
Applicable Rate from and including the Closing Date to, but excluding, the date
of such payment). Such payment is to be made within five (5) Business Days from
the date on which the Final Purchase Price is finally determined pursuant to

            5.2 ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS; CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) The Sellers
shall cause the books and records, contracts, documents and other information of
the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries to be in the sole possession and control of
the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries or the Buyer at or as soon as
practicable after the Closing. To the extent that books and records, Contracts,
documents and other information of the Sellers or Affiliates relevant to or
affecting the Business and necessary to the operation of the Business after the
Closing Date relate partially to the Sellers or their Affiliates other than the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Venture Entities, the Sellers or
Affiliates shall provide the Buyer with full access to the portions of such
information pertaining to the Business.

            (b) During the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on
the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms, the Sellers shall, give the Buyer and its counsel, accountants,
employees, agents, financing sources and other authorized representatives full
access, during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, to the
officers, directors, employees, premises, properties, books, records, financial
statements, Tax Returns relating solely to the Sold Companies, any Subsidiary
and, to the extent the Sellers have authority and control to do so, the Venture
Entities, data and Contracts of the Business and the Sold Companies and the
Subsidiaries and, to the extent the Sellers have authority and control to do so,
the Venture Entities; provided that such access does not interfere with normal
business operations; and further provided that such access will not include
sampling or testing of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property
without Sellers' prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Any information provided to or obtained by the Buyer pursuant to
this SECTION 5.2(b) will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and must be
held by the Buyer in accordance with and be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Buyer agrees to be bound by and comply with the
provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement as if such provisions were

shall cause their Affiliates and respective officers, directors, employees,
counsel, accountants, agents and other representatives to, (i) hold in strict
confidence all information relating to the Business and the Sold Companies,
Subsidiaries and Venture Entities as conducted before the Closing; provided that
the foregoing shall not apply to information that is or becomes generally
available to the public through no action of the Sellers. If any Seller or its
Affiliates or their respective officers, directors, employees, counsel,
accountants, agents and other representatives are legally compelled or required
to disclose any such information, it is agreed that Sellers will promptly notify
Buyer to permit Buyer to seek a protective order or take other appropriate
action. Sellers will cooperate in Buyer's efforts to obtain a protective order
or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to
such information. If, in the absence of a protective order, Sellers or any of
their Affiliates and respective officers, directors, employees, counsel,
accountants, agents and other representatives are, in the opinion of counsel,
compelled as a matter of Law to disclose such information to a third party,
Sellers may disclose to the third party compelling disclosure only the part of
such information as is required by Law to be disclosed (in which case, prior to
disclosure, Sellers will use reasonable efforts to advise and consult with Buyer
and its counsel as to such disclosure and the nature and wording of such
disclosure), and Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
confidential treatment of any such information so disclosed. Sellers acknowledge
and agree that other remedies cannot fully compensate Buyer for a violation by
Sellers of the terms of this SECTION 5.2(c) and that Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive relief to prevent any such violation or continuing violation by any
Seller. At the Closing, the Sellers and their subsidiaries shall assign their
respective rights under any confidentiality agreement relating to the Business
or the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries with a third party to Buyer or its
Affiliates.

with Cooper's regulatory reporting obligations, including, without limitation,
assistance with preparing and filing reports required to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

other than the entities that are listed on SCHEDULE 5.3, and the parties shall
make or cause to be made all appropriate filings as required by applicable Law
with respect thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION
5.3 and subject to the following sentence, Buyer may make protective elections
under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to Cooper Standard Automotive
(Deutschland) GmbH, Cooper Standard Automotive Espana S.A., and Cooper Standard
Automotive Ceska' republika s.r.o. Prior to the filing of any such protective
election, Buyer shall provide Cooper with a copy of each proposed protective
election under Section 338(g) of the Code for its approval (which approval will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

            5.4 TAX RETURNS, CONTESTS AND COOPERATION. (a) The Buyer and the
Sellers agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,
as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (including powers of
attorney and, at the expense of the requesting party, reasonable access to the
other party's Tax Return preparer, provided that such other party may limit such
access as it reasonably deems necessary to protect confidential information)
relating to any of the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries (including access to
books and records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related
to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any Taxing Authority, and the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax or
Tax Return. The Buyer and the Sellers shall retain all books and records that
pertain to the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries until the expiration of all
relevant statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer and
the Sellers, any extensions thereof). At the end of such period, each party
shall provide the other with at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice
before destroying any such books and records, during which period the party
receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense, of such
books and records. Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will revoke, amend or
otherwise modify any existing powers of attorney effective for or with respect
to any Current Tax Matter without the prior written consent of Cooper, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

            (b) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared
and timely filed, all consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns in respect
of any of the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
which will include the operations of any of the Sold Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries, and shall timely pay all Taxes shown on such Tax Returns. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with prior practices unless
otherwise required by Law. The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to
be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns in respect of the Sold
Companies and any of the Subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including for any Straddle Period (the "BUYER FILED TAX RETURNS"). The Buyer
shall provide Cooper with a copy of each proposed Buyer Filed Tax Return (and
such additional information regarding such Buyer Filed Tax Return as may
reasonably be requested by Cooper) for its approval (which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) (i) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
filing of such Tax Return or (ii) in the case of a Tax Return that is required
to be filed within twenty (20) days of the Closing Date, at least ten (10) days
prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed; provided, that in the
case of a

                                       40
<PAGE>

Tax Return that is required to be filed within ten (10) days of the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to afford Cooper a
reasonable opportunity to review and approve such Buyer Filed Tax Return prior
to filing such Tax Return. Any Buyer Filed Tax Return shall be prepared on a
basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return; provided further
that, if after consultation in good faith with the Sellers, the Buyer reasonably
determines that it is required by Law to prepare any Tax Return for a Straddle
Period on a basis inconsistent with the last previous similar Tax Return, then
they shall so notify the Sellers and shall prepare such Tax Returns in
accordance with applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax
Return or Tax election of any of the Sold Companies or any Subsidiary in respect
of a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent that such amendment, refiling,
revocation or other modification would have an adverse effect on any of the
Sellers or their Affiliates, without the prior written consent of Cooper, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and other
such Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes, but excluding
any Taxes based on or attributable to income or gains) and related fees
(including any penalties, interest and additions to Tax) ("TRANSFER TAXES")
arising out of or incurred in connection with this Agreement (other than in
connection with the Restructuring) shall be borne by the Buyer. The party that
is legally required to file a Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be
responsible for preparing and timely filing such Tax Return. All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar
Tax Return and in accordance with applicable Law.

            (d) All Tax sharing agreements between any of the Sold Companies or
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any of Sellers or their Affiliates (other
than the Sold Companies or any of the Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date and shall have no further effect for any
taxable year (whether the current year, a future year or a past year).

            (e) (i) If any Taxing Authority asserts a claim against Buyer or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the Taxes of any of the Sold Companies or any
Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, which, if successful, would result in
an indemnity payment by Sellers to Buyer pursuant to SECTION 5.5 hereof (a "TAX
CLAIM"), Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers in writing of such Tax Claim
stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the
extent known by Buyer, and shall include a copy of any correspondence received
from the Taxing Authority. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given to the Sellers
within a sufficient period of time to allow the Sellers to effectively contest
such Tax Claim to the extent provided in this SECTION 5.4(e), the Sellers shall
not be liable to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to the extent the Sellers
are actually prejudiced thereby.

            (ii) Except as otherwise provided in SECTION 5.4(e)(iii) or
      5.4(e)(iv), Sellers may, at their own expense, participate in and, upon
      notice to Buyer, assume the defense, compromise or resolution of (A) any
      Tax Claim and (B) any other suit, action, audit, litigation or proceeding
      to the extent such claim, suit, action, litigation or proceeding relates
      to matters indemnifiable by Sellers pursuant to SECTION 5.5 hereof,
      including as a result of any breach by Sellers of any representation or
      warranty contained in SECTION 3.10 hereof, (including for the avoidance of
      doubt any Current Tax Matter) (each a "PRE-CLOSING TAX MATTER"), provided
      that Sellers acknowledge in writing their indemnification obligation for
      all Taxes relating to the Pre-Closing Tax Matter. If Sellers assume such
      defense, Buyer shall have the right (but not the duty) to participate in
      the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate
      from counsel employed by Sellers. If Sellers do not assume the defense of
      such Pre-Closing Tax Matter, then Buyer may defend such Pre-Closing Tax
      Matter at the sole cost of Sellers and the Sellers may participate in, but
      not control, the defense of such Pre-Closing Tax Matter at the Sellers'
      sole expense. Sellers shall not enter into any settlement of or otherwise
      compromise any

                                       41
<PAGE>

      such Pre-Closing Tax Matter to the extent that it relates to the Sold
      Companies or any Subsidiary and such settlement or compromise would
      materially and adversely affect the Tax liability of the Buyer, the Sold
      Companies or any Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period without the
      prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
      withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Sellers shall, to the extent reasonably
      requested by Buyer, keep Buyer informed as to the status of such
      Pre-Closing Tax Matter, including all settlement negotiations and offers.

            (iii) Buyer shall have the right to control the defense, compromise,
      and resolution of any Tax claim, suit, action, audit, litigation or
      proceeding relating to a Straddle Period (a "STRADDLE PERIOD TAX MATTER").
      If Buyer assumes such defense, Sellers shall have the right (but not the
      duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
      own expense, separate from counsel employed by Buyer. If Buyer does not
      assume the defense of such Straddle Period Tax Matter, then Sellers may
      defend such Straddle Period Tax Matter and Buyer may participate in, but
      not control, the defense of such Straddle Period Tax Matter with each
      party bearing their own expenses. Buyer shall not enter into any
      settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Straddle Period Tax Matter
      to the extent that such settlement or compromise would materially and
      adversely affect the Tax liability of Sellers or any of their Affiliates
      for any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
      Cooper, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
      delayed. Buyer shall, to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers, keep
      Sellers informed as to the status of such Straddle Period Tax Matter,
      including all settlement negotiations and offers.

            (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in
      the case of a Transfer Pricing Tax Matter, Sellers may defend such
      proceeding and Buyer may participate in the defense of such proceeding
      (including without limitation being present at all meetings, hearings or
      other proceedings), with each party bearing their own expenses. Seller
      shall not make any concession, settlement, closing or any other agreement
      with respect to any material item thereto without the consent of Buyer,
      which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Sellers shall promptly
      keep Buyer informed as to the status of all material items with respect to
      such proceedings, including without limitation all communications with the
      appropriate Taxing Authority, all notices (including time and location)
      for meetings, hearings or other proceedings, and all settlement
      discussions, negotiations and offers.

            (f) Other than as provided in SECTION 5.4(e) hereof, Buyer will
promptly deliver to Sellers and Sellers will promptly deliver to Buyer copies of
all communications sent to or received from any Taxing Authority in so far as
they relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period of the Sold
Companies or Subsidiaries.

            5.5 TAX MATTERS. Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify Buyer
and its Affiliates and hold them harmless from all Losses attributable to (i)
all Taxes imposed on or payable with respect to the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of
a Straddle Period as determined under SECTION 5.5(c), (ii) all Taxes of any
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the
Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing)
are or were a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Sections.1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local,
or foreign law or regulation, as a transferee or successor, by contract or
otherwise (iii) any Taxes (including Transfer Taxes) arising from or in
connection with the Restructuring, (iv) any Taxes arising from or in connection
with any breach by Sellers of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement and (v) all costs and expenses, including reasonable legal
fees and expenses, attributable to any item in subclauses (i) - (iv).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers shall only be liable to
Buyer for any particular Tax that is not an Income Tax pursuant to this SECTION
5.5, a breach of

                                       42
<PAGE>

representation or warranty contained in SECTION 3.10 hereof, or otherwise only
to the extent the amount such Tax that is not an Income Tax exceeds the amounts
reflected in the Tax Reserve.

            (b) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and hold them
harmless from all Losses attributable to (i) any Taxes imposed on or payable
with respect to the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries relating to a
Post-Closing Tax Period or the post-Closing portion of a Straddle Period as
determined under SECTION 5.5(c), (ii) any Taxes of any of the Sold Companies or
Subsidiaries paid by Sellers or any of their Affiliates that is reflected in the
Tax Reserve, (iii) any Transfer Taxes (other than in connection with the
Restructuring), (iv) Taxes arising from or in connection with any breach by
Buyer of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement,
(v) any and all Losses for additional Taxes owed by any of Sellers, any of its
Affiliates, any of the Sold Companies or any Subsidiary (including Tax owed by
any such Person due to this indemnification payment) resulting solely from any
transaction engaged in by Buyer, the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing
Date after Buyer's purchase of the Shares and (vi) all costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item in
subclauses (i) - (v). The Buyer and Cooper agree to report all transactions not
in the ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyer's
purchase of the Shares on Buyer's federal income Tax Return to the extent
permitted by Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

            (c) The portion of Tax or Tax refund, including interest paid
therewith, related to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period shall (i)
in the case of any Taxes other than sales or use taxes, value-added taxes,
employment taxes, withholding taxes, and Income Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the pre-Closing portion of the
Straddle Period and denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle
Period, and (ii) in the case of any sales or use taxes, value-added taxes,
employment taxes, withholding taxes, and Income Taxes, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on and included the
Closing Date. In determining the amount of Income Tax of any of the Sold
Companies or any Subsidiary for a Straddle Period attributable to an interest in
a Venture Entity, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
attribute the portion of such Income Tax related to the pre-Closing portion of
the Straddle Period equal to the amount which would be payable if the Straddle
Period ended on and included the Closing Date, and if the Parties are not able
to so attribute, then such Income Taxes shall be apportioned in accordance with
SECTION 5.5(c)(i) above. The portion of Tax or Tax refund, including interest
paid therewith, related to the post-Closing portion of the Straddle Period shall
be calculated in a corresponding manner as that described above.

            (d) Any indemnity payment to be made pursuant to this SECTION 5.5
shall be paid no later than ten (10) days after the indemnified party makes
written demand upon the indemnifying party, provided that no such payment shall
be made later than three (3) days prior to when the Tax to which such payment
relates is due and payable.

            (e) The indemnification provisions in this SECTION 5.5 shall survive
the Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations.

            (f) The parties agree that any indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated for all federal, state, local and
foreign Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

            (g) In calculating the amount of any indemnity payment to be made
pursuant to this SECTION 5.5, such payment will be reduced by any Tax benefit
actually realized by the party receiving such payment (net of any Tax detriment)
in the Tax period in which the indemnification payment is made

                                       43
<PAGE>

in respect of any Losses for which such indemnification payment is made. For the
avoidance of doubt, such payments shall not be reduced for additions to net
operating losses.

            5.6 REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS. (a) The Buyer agrees that it shall not
cause or permit any of the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries to carry back to
any Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period any net operating loss, loss from
operations or other Tax attribute that is attributable to a Post-Closing Tax
Period (a "POST-CLOSING LOSS") except in the case of a Post-Closing Loss that
would be forfeited under applicable Law unless it was first carried back to a
Straddle Period or Pre-Closing Tax Period, in which case the Buyer may, at its
sole expense, cause or permit any of the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries to carry
back such Post-Closing Loss. The Sellers shall timely pay to the Buyer any
refund, credit, offset or other Tax benefit actually realized by the Seller with
respect to a Post-Closing Loss, provided that the Seller will have no obligation
under this Agreement to return or remit any such refund or other Tax benefit
attributable to a breach by the Buyer of the foregoing undertaking.

            (b) The Buyer shall give the Sellers at least ten (10) days notice
before it files a claim for a Tax refund with respect to a Post-Closing Loss
that it is permitted to carry back to a taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date pursuant to SECTION 5.6(a). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Sellers shall use any Post-Closing Loss that
is carried back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to SECTION 5.6(a) to reduce
their Taxes for such taxable period and (ii) the Sellers shall in no event be
obligated to reimburse or otherwise indemnify the Buyer for any Losses
(including, without limitation, Losses for Taxes) resulting from the
disallowance of a Post-Closing Loss.

            (c) Sellers shall be entitled to all refunds of Seller Taxes. Buyer
shall promptly notify Sellers upon receipt of notice of the right to receive a
refund of Seller Taxes and remit any such actual payment (or, in the case of a
Straddle Period, the portion attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period as
determined under SECTION 5.5(c) hereof) when received to Sellers promptly upon
receipt. To the extent any refund of Seller Taxes is disallowed, Seller shall
timely reimburse Buyer for any amount paid to it by Buyer, including any
interest or penalties imposed thereon, provided that Buyer shall not be entitled
to reimbursement for interest or penalties imposed with respect to a refund of
Seller Taxes which is disallowed: (i) if such interest or penalties arise solely
as a result of (A) actions taken (or failed to be taken) by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period, or (B) any claim, suit,
action, audit, litigation or proceeding relating to Taxes in respect of a
Post-Closing Tax Period, or (ii) that accrue after Sellers pay to Buyer the
amount due pursuant to this SECTION 5.6(c) calculated on the date of such
payment.

            (d) Buyer will ensure that, to the extent permitted by Law, in
respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, that any Sold Company
that can participate in the Group Relief provisions within the United Kingdom,
that Buyer will reasonably assist and provide Sellers with all claims,
elections, notices, and any other document that may reasonably be required to
enable a Sold Company to participate in the Group Relief provisions with the
remaining United Kingdom companies of Sellers. If as a result of the Closing, a
Sold Company or Subsidiary is treated as having a chargeable gain, the Sellers
shall procure that a relevant UK Affiliate shall, and the Buyer shall procure
that the relevant Sold Company or Subsidiary shall, make a joint election to
treat such chargeable gain as accruing to the Seller's UK Affiliate and not to
the Sold Company or Subsidiary. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no payment shall
be made by the Sold Company or Subsidiary to the Sellers or its UK Affiliate as
consideration for making the Group Relief election described above and (ii) no
payment shall be made by Sellers or any of its Affiliates to Buyer or any of its
Affiliates as consideration for making the Group Relief election described
above.

            5.7 EMPLOYEES; BENEFIT PLANS.

            (a) Employees. All (i) active employees of the Sold Companies and
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, and (ii) active employees of the Sellers who
are (A) employed primarily in the Business on the Closing Date and (B) listed on
SCHEDULE 5.7(a), are hereinafter referred to as the "ACTIVE COMPANY EMPLOYEES."
Any employee of the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries or employee of the Sellers
who is employed primarily in the Business and is listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(a) who
is not actively at work on the Closing Date due to a short-term absence, whether
paid or unpaid (e.g., vacation, holiday, jury duty, FMLA, pregnancy, parental
and bereavement leave, military leave, emergency leave, compassionate leave,
short term disability, scheduled time off, or illness or injury leave) in
compliance with the applicable policies of the Sellers, Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries (or a long-term absence covered under a long-term disability
Company Benefit Plan) or any employee of the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries or
employee of the Sellers who is employed primarily in the Business and is listed
on SCHEDULE 5.7(a) who is not actively at work on the Closing Date and is
receiving worker's compensation payments as required by Law will be deemed an
Active Company Employee. To the extent they are not employed by the Sold
Companies or Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall make offers of
employment in the Business to all Active Company Employees who are employed by
the Sellers primarily in the Business immediately prior to the Closing Date and
are listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(a). The parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all such employees who are offered ongoing
employment with the Buyer as described in the preceding sentence to accept such
offers of ongoing employment. The Buyer shall not involuntarily terminate the
employment of any Active Company Employees on the Closing Date (i.e.,
termination other than due to death or resignation). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, Seller shall retain or assume all liabilities, and the
Buyer and its Affiliates shall assume no liabilities, with respect to (x) the
Discontinued Business Employees, whether under the Company Benefit Plans or
otherwise, and (y) any Company Benefit Plan which is not listed on SCHEDULE
3.11(a)(i)-1 and for which costs were not expressly included in the income
statements of the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries.

            (b) Seller Benefit Plans. Effective as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date, except as required by Law, collective bargaining agreement or
otherwise contemplated by this SECTION 5.7 or the Transition Services Agreement,
all Company Employees will cease active participation in, and any benefit
accrual under, each of the Seller Benefit Plans other than the Assumed Plans.
The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that each of the Sold Company Benefit Plans
will continue to be sponsored or maintained by the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries, as applicable, on and immediately following the Closing Date.

            (c) Continuation of Comparable Benefit Plans/Prior Service. For the
period from the Closing Date through December 31, 2005 (or such other longer
period required by Law or contract), the Buyer shall maintain, or shall cause
the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries to maintain and, except as contemplated
by the Transition Services Agreement, perform employer's and administrators
obligations arising under or relating to each of the employee benefit plans,
programs, policies and arrangements for Active Company Employees (other than
Active Company Employees who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement
(such employees, the "UNION EMPLOYEES")), that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the employee benefit plans (excluding equity based incentives) in
which such employees participated immediately prior to the Closing Date;
provided, further, that nothing in this SECTION 5.7 shall be construed to mean
that Buyer or any of its Affiliates cannot amend or terminate any particular
Sold Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit, compensation or
incentive plan, policy or arrangement so long as the requirements of this
SECTION 5.7 are otherwise satisfied. To the extent not otherwise required by or
resulting from the operation of Law, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries to, recognize each Active Company Employee's and
Former Employee's service for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(but not for any other purpose, such as benefit

                                       45
<PAGE>

accrual or level of benefits) with the Sellers, any of the Sold Companies, the
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
predecessors as of the Closing Date as service with the Buyer, the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the extent that such service
was credited under the corresponding Company Benefit Plans, under the Buyer's,
the Sold Companies' and the Subsidiaries' employee welfare benefit plans,
employee pension plans, vacation, disability, severance and other employee
benefit plans or policies and any other such plans or policies in which the
Active Company Employees and Former Employees become or may become eligible to
participate on or after the Closing Date.

            (d) Welfare Plans. Except as provided in this SECTION 5.7(d) and
SECTIONS 5.7(i), (k), (l), (n) and (q), coverage for all Active Company
Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under the Seller Benefit
Plans that are welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA
("SELLER WELFARE PLANS") shall cease to be effective immediately prior to the
Closing Date. Sellers and the Seller Welfare Plans shall be liable for all
claims incurred at any time for individuals who are not Active Company Employees
or Former Employees (and their spouses and dependents) and for all claims
incurred (whether or not reported) prior to the Closing Date with respect to
Active Company Employees and Former Employees and their spouses and dependents
under the Seller Welfare Plans. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Sold Companies and Subsidiaries shall provide coverage and benefits for all
Active Company Employees and their respective eligible spouses and dependents
under Buyer's Welfare Plans (as defined below) and shall be responsible for all
claims incurred (whether or not reported) with respect to Active Company
Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents on and after the Closing
Date under the Sold Company Benefit Plans and any plans sponsored by Buyer that
are welfare benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA (such
plans collectively, the "BUYER'S WELFARE PLANS"). For purposes of this SECTION
5.7(d) and SECTION 5.7(j), a claim will be deemed "incurred" on the date that
the event that gives rise to the claim occurs (for purposes of life insurance,
sickness, accident and disability programs) or on the date that treatment or
services are provided (for purposes of health care programs); provided that in
the event such an individual is in the hospital as an in-patient as of the
Closing Date, Sellers shall remain responsible for claims and expenses incurred
in connection therewith until release from such hospitalization. The Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries to, waive any
pre-existing condition limitations and eligibility waiting periods with respect
to Active Company Employees and their respective spouses and dependents under
the Buyer's Welfare Plans (but only to the extent such pre-existing condition
limitations and eligibility waiting periods were satisfied under the Company
Benefit Plans as of the Closing Date) and shall recognize (or cause to be
recognized) the dollar amount of all deductibles, co-payments, co-insurance and
out-of-pocket limitations incurred with respect to Active Company Employees and
their respective spouses and dependents under the Company Benefit Plans during
the calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductibles, co-payment, co-insurance or out-of-pocket limitations
for such calendar year under the corresponding Buyer's welfare plans in which
the Active Company Employees become entitled to participate after the Closing
Date. The provisions of this SECTION 5.7(d) shall not apply in respect of any
severance or termination plans, policies or arrangements.

            (e) Pension Plan Transfer. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall establish (or cause the Sold Companies or one of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to establish) a defined benefit pension plan and trust intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and tax-exempt under Section
501(a) of the Code ("BUYER'S PENSION PLAN") for the benefit of Active Company
Employees and Former Employees (and beneficiaries thereof) who have an accrued
benefit under the Cooper Spectrum Retirement Plan ("COOPER'S PENSION PLAN") at
the Closing Date (collectively, the "PENSION PARTICIPANTS"). Pension
Participants who are Former Employees are listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(e) (which
schedule shall be delivered on or prior to the Closing). Each Pension
Participant participating in Cooper's Pension Plan at the Closing Date shall
become a participant in Buyer's Pension Plan as of the Closing Date and shall
begin to accrue benefits under the Buyer's Pension Plan as of the Closing Date
in

                                       46
<PAGE>

accordance therewith. Buyer's Pension Plan shall provide the Pension
Participants with credit for their service with the Sellers, the Sold Companies
and Subsidiaries, as applicable, and any of their respective Affiliates or their
respective predecessors, prior to the Closing Date for all purposes for which
such service was recognized under Cooper's Pension Plan including, without
limitation, vesting, benefit accrual, eligibility to participate and eligibility
for disability and early retirement benefits (including subsidies relating to
such benefits); provided that such service credit shall not result in
duplication of benefits or accruals, and shall be contingent upon the completion
of the asset transfer described below in this SECTION 5.7(e)

            (ii) On the Closing Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter,
      following the establishment of the Buyer's Pension Plan, but in no event
      later than 45 days following the establishment of such plan, the Sellers
      and Buyer shall cause to be filed all required Forms 5310-A and any other
      required IRS or PBGC forms with the appropriate governmental agency in
      order for the Buyer's Pension Plan to receive a transfer of assets and
      liabilities from Cooper's Pension Plan on or following the Closing Date in
      accordance with applicable law and in accordance with the provisions
      described below in this SECTION 5.7(e).

            (iii) Effective as of the Closing Date, in accordance with the
      provisions of this SECTION 5.7(e), Sellers shall cause Cooper's Pension
      Plan and related trust to transfer to Buyer's Pension Plan and related
      trust, and Buyer shall cause Buyer's Pension Plan and related trust to
      accept from Cooper's Pension Plan and related trust, a transfer of all
      liabilities for benefits (including ancillary benefits) accrued under
      Cooper's Pension Plan by the Pension Participants, calculated as of the
      Closing Date in the manner described below; provided, however, that the
      acceptance of such liabilities shall be expressly conditioned on the
      completion of the asset transfer described below in this SECTION 5.7(e).
      Upon the completion of such transfer of liabilities, the Pension
      Participants shall become participants in Buyer's Pension Plan with
      respect to the liabilities so transferred. Without limiting the generality
      of the foregoing, subject to paragraph (vii) below, on and after the
      Closing Date, Buyer's Pension Plan shall provide to the Pension
      Participants all benefits (including ancillary benefits) earned by such
      individuals under Cooper's Pension Plan, up to the Closing Date, as well
      as any benefits accrued by such individuals under Buyer's Pension Plan on
      and after the Closing Date.

            (iv) As soon as practicable following the establishment of Buyer's
      Pension Plan and satisfaction of any applicable regulatory filing
      requirements and the requirements set forth in this SECTION 5.7(e), but
      not later than 180 days following satisfaction of such requirements unless
      the parties otherwise agree in writing (the "FINAL TRANSFER DATE"),
      Sellers shall cause a transfer of the assets in respect of the transferred
      liabilities from the trust(s) established pursuant to Cooper's Pension
      Plan to the trust(s) established pursuant to Buyer's Pension Plan, and
      Buyer shall cause the trust(s) established pursuant to Buyer's Pension
      Plan to accept such transfer of assets, in a total amount determined in
      accordance with Code Section 414(l) and this SECTION 5.7(e). In no event
      shall the total amount so transferred be less than the amount that is
      necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section 414(l) of the Code. Such
      transfer of assets shall be in cash or in marketable securities designated
      by Cooper that are held in the trust established pursuant to Cooper's
      Pension Plan. Unless the Sellers and Buyer agree otherwise in writing, all
      transfers shall occur on the last business day of a month. Cooper's
      Actuary (as defined below) shall be responsible for the required actuarial
      certification under Section 414(l) of the Code.

            (v) Sellers shall cause the enrolled actuary for Cooper's Pension
      Plan ("COOPER'S ACTUARY") to calculate the amount of assets to be
      transferred in respect of such transferred liabilities, as if Cooper's
      Pension Plan were terminated on the Closing Date using the "safe harbor"
      assumptions (as in effect on the Closing Date) that would be used by the
      PBGC to

                                       47
<PAGE>

      calculate such benefits upon the termination of such plan (assuming no
      ancillary benefits have been amended out of Cooper's Pension Plan prior to
      such calculation), (the "TRANSFERRED BENEFIT LIABILITY") on the basis of
      benefits accrued by the Pension Participants under Cooper's Pension Plan
      as of the Closing Date, in accordance with the requirements of Section
      414(l) of the Code. The amount of the assets to be transferred from
      Cooper's Pension Plan to Buyer's Pension Plan in respect of such
      Transferred Benefit Liabilities, as calculated pursuant to this SECTION
      5.7(e), shall be referred to as the "TRANSFER AMOUNT."

            (vi) Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and
      expenses incurred by Sellers, Cooper's Actuary or Cooper's Pension Plan in
      the calculation and transfer of the Transfer Amount to the extent such
      fees and expenses are not paid from the assets of Cooper's Pension Plan.
      Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all fees and expenses
      incurred by Buyer, the enrolled actuary for Buyer's Pension Plan or
      Buyer's Pension Plan in connection with the calculation and transfer of
      the Transfer Amount. The actuarial calculation of the Transferred Benefit
      Liability and Transferred Amount as well as assumptions and methodologies
      used to calculate such Transferred Benefit Liability and Transferred
      Amount determined by Cooper's Actuary shall be subject to review and
      challenge by an actuarial firm designated by Buyer. In the event of a good
      faith dispute between those two actuaries as to the amount to be
      transferred under this SECTION 5.7(e), and such dispute remains unresolved
      for a period of thirty (30) days, the chief financial officers of Cooper
      and Buyer, respectively, will endeavor to resolve the issue. Should such
      dispute remain unresolved for a period of twenty (20) days, Sellers and
      Buyer shall select and appoint a third-party independent actuary who is
      mutually satisfactory to Sellers and Buyer. Such third-party actuary shall
      be instructed to render its decision within twenty (20) days and such
      decision shall be conclusive as to any dispute for which the third-party
      actuary was appointed. The cost of such third-party actuary shall be
      divided equally between Sellers and Buyer.

            (vii) From and after the Closing Date until the Final Transfer Date,
      any benefit payable to a Pension Participant shall be paid and continue to
      be paid out of Cooper's Pension Plan trust. On and after the Final
      Transfer Date, any such benefits payable to a Pension Participant shall be
      paid from Buyer's Pension Plan trust.

            (viii) All amounts to be transferred between the trust(s)
      established pursuant to Cooper's Pension Plan and the trust established
      pursuant to Buyer's Pension Plan pursuant to SECTION 5.7(e)(i) shall
      include investment gains or losses on the Transferred Amount from the
      Closing Date to the Final Transfer Date, such investment gains and losses
      being determined on the basis of the aggregate net investment experience
      of Cooper's Pension Plan during such period.

            (ix) Notwithstanding any provision of this SECTION 5.7(e) to the
      contrary, no transfer of assets from Cooper's Pension Plan shall be made
      prior to such time as Buyer has provided to Sellers (A) evidence
      reasonably satisfactory to Sellers that Buyer has timely completed all
      Governmental Authority filings or submissions needed in order for Buyer's
      Pension Plan to receive a transfer of assets from Cooper's Pension Plan;
      and (B)(1) a current and valid favorable IRS determination letter with
      respect to Buyer's Pension Plan, or (2) a representation from Buyer that
      Buyer's Pension Plan is intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) and
      that Buyer will timely file (or has already filed) an application for such
      favorable determination letter with respect to Buyer's Pension Plan with
      the IRS and that Buyer will make any and all necessary amendments on a
      retroactive basis to Buyer's Pension Plan as are required by the IRS to
      obtain such favorable determination.

                                       48

            (f) Savings Plan Transfer. (i) Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall establish (or cause the Sold Companies or one of its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to establish) a defined contribution pension plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code ("BUYER'S SAVINGS PLAN") for the
benefit of Active Company Employees and Former Employees (and beneficiaries
thereof) who have an account balance under the Cooper Spectrum Investment
Savings Plan ("COOPER'S SAVINGS PLAN") at the Closing Date (collectively, the
"SAVINGS PARTICIPANTS"). Savings Participants who are Former Employees are
listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(f) (which schedule shall be delivered on or prior to the
Closing). Buyer's Savings Plan shall provide such Savings Participants with
credit for their service with the Sellers, Sold Companies and Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and any of their respective Affiliates or their respective
predecessors, prior to the Closing Date for all purposes for which service was
credited under Cooper's Savings Plan); provided that such service credit shall
not result in duplication of benefits or accruals, and shall be contingent upon
the completion of the asset transfer described below in this SECTION 5.7(f).

            (ii) On the Closing Date, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the
      Sellers and Buyer shall cause to be filed all required Forms 5310-A and
      any other required IRS forms in order for the Buyer's Savings Plan to
      receive a transfer of assets from Cooper's Savings Plan on or following
      the Closing Date in accordance with applicable law and in accordance with
      the provisions described below in this SECTION 5.7(f).

            (iii) As soon as practicable following the establishment of the
      Buyer's Savings Plan and satisfaction of any applicable regulatory filing
      requirements and the requirements set forth in this SECTION 5.7(f), but
      not later than ninety (90) days following satisfaction of such
      requirements unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, Sellers shall
      cause a transfer of the plan accounts, valued as of the date of transfer,
      of the Savings Participants, from Cooper's Savings Plan and related trust
      to Buyer's Savings Plan and related trust, and Buyer shall cause Buyer's
      Savings Plan and related trust to accept such transfer of assets (the date
      on which such transfer occurs is referred to as the "SAVINGS TRANSFER
      DATE"), including outstanding loan notes and in-kind transfers of property
      designated by Cooper. Unless the Sellers and Buyer agree otherwise in
      writing, all transfers shall occur on the last Business Day of a month.

            (iv) From and after the Closing Date until the Savings Transfer
      Date, any benefit payable to a Savings Participant shall be paid and
      continue to be paid out of Cooper's Savings Plan trust (it also being
      understood that Cooper's Savings Plan shall continue to administer such
      accounts through the Savings Transfer Date, including participant
      investment directions). On and after the Savings Transfer Date, any such
      benefits payable to a Savings Participant shall be paid from Buyer's
      Savings Plan trust. Sellers and Buyer shall work together to develop a
      process whereby Savings Participants who have loans outstanding under
      Cooper's Savings Plan as of the Closing Date will be permitted to continue
      to make periodic repayments on such outstanding loans through reduction of
      salary paid by Buyer or the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries, and Buyer or
      the Sold Companies or Subsidiaries remitting such payments to Cooper's
      Savings Plan on a timely basis.

            (v) Notwithstanding any provision of this SECTION 5.7(f) to the
      contrary, no transfer of assets from Cooper's Savings Plan shall be made
      prior to such time as Buyer has provided to Sellers either (A) a current
      and valid favorable IRS determination letter with respect to Buyer's
      Savings Plan, or (B) a representation from Buyer that Buyer's Savings Plan
      is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and that Buyer
      will timely file (or has already filed) an application for such favorable
      determination letter with respect to Buyer's Savings Plan with the IRS and
      that Buyer will make any and all necessary amendments on a retroactive
      basis to Buyer's Savings Plan as are required by the IRS to obtain such
      favorable determination.

                                       49
<PAGE>

            (g) Assumed Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer shall
assume sponsorship of and, except as otherwise expressly provided in this
SECTION 5.7, all obligations under, Liabilities with respect to, and assets with
respect to, the Company Benefit Plans set forth on SCHEDULE 5.7(g) (the "ASSUMED
PLANS"). Sellers and Buyer shall take all actions necessary to transfer such
sponsorship and assets to Buyer as of the Closing Date. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this SECTION 5.7, Seller shall retain and assume all
obligations under and Liabilities with respect to any Seller Benefit Plan which
is not an Assumed Plan.

            (h) Unused Vacation. The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries to, credit each Active Company Employee with the
unused vacation days to which the Active Company Employee is entitled through
the Closing Date; provided that if Sellers shall be required by applicable Law
to pay any Active Company Employee the cash value of their unused vacation days
described in this SECTION 5.7(h), then Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for the
amount so paid by Sellers and shall not be required to honor such days.

            (i) Severance Obligations; Stay Bonus.

            (i) Buyer's Obligations. For the period from the Closing Date until
      December 31, 2005, subject to the immediately following SECTION
      5.7(i)(ii), the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Sold Companies and the
      Subsidiaries to, provide severance benefits to any Company Employee (that
      is not a Union Employee), in accordance with the severance procedures of
      the Sellers, the Sold Companies or the Subsidiaries set forth on EXHIBIT
      C, for (A) terminations of employment on or after the Closing, not
      including terminations due solely to this Agreement or to the consummation
      of the transaction contemplated hereby and (B) terminations of employment
      before the Closing with respect to which a Company Employee is receiving
      ongoing severance payments as of the Closing, but only to the extent such
      severance benefits are payable pursuant to arrangements both specifically
      identified on SCHEDULE 3.11(a)(i)-1 and accrued on the financial
      statements as of the Closing Date, which accruals will be computed in the
      ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. In addition,
      subject to SECTION 5.7(i)(ii), Buyer shall assume all obligations and
      Liabilities under the arrangements set forth on SCHEDULE 5.7(i)(i) with
      respect to any individuals listed on that Schedule who execute a Waiver
      prior to the Closing Date.

            (ii) Sellers' Obligations. Notwithstanding any other provision of
      this Agreement, (A) Sellers shall be responsible for and retain all
      obligations and Liabilities with respect to severance, stay bonus
      obligations, sale incentives and termination payments or benefits,
      including, without limitation, any tax gross-up benefits, under all
      employment related agreements, including, without limitation, those
      identified on SCHEDULE 3.11(g), or otherwise triggered solely by the
      Restructuring or the sale of the Shares, and all severance and termination
      payments or benefits incurred by Company Employees on or prior to the
      Closing Date, whether under Company Benefit Plans or otherwise, other than
      amounts that are payable by Buyer pursuant to SECTION 5.7(i)(i)(B) above;
      (B) Sellers shall be responsible for and retain all obligations and
      Liabilities under the Severance Plan with respect to individuals other
      than those listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(i)(i) and individuals on SCHEDULE
      5.7(i)(i) who do not execute a Waiver prior to the Closing Date; and (C)
      with respect to the arrangements set forth on SCHEDULE 5.7(i)(i) with
      respect to individuals who execute a Waiver prior to the Closing Date, (x)
      Sellers shall indemnify, reimburse and hold Buyer harmless for, all
      obligations and Liabilities (including, without limitation, any tax
      gross-up benefits) under such arrangements (to the extent such obligations
      and liabilities (i) arise pursuant to the terms of such arrangements in
      effect immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) in the case of the
      Employment Agreement, arise from a termination of employment during the
      Term (as defined in the Employment Agreement) in effect as of the Closing
      Date, without regard to any extensions of the Term under such Employment

                                       50

      Agreement after the Closing Date, including any automatic extensions of
      the Term after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 3 of the Employment
      Agreement) arising in connection with termination of employment of any of
      the individuals party thereto, provided that Buyer shall be responsible
      solely for severance and termination payments made pursuant to Section
      1(a) of Exhibit C to the Severance Plan (for the individuals listed on
      SCHEDULE 5.7(i)(i) or Section 6(a)(i) of the Employment Agreement and, to
      the extent accrued on the financial statements as of the Closing Date,
      which accruals will be computed in the ordinary course of business
      consistent with past practice, any amount paid pursuant to Section
      1(c)(ii) of Exhibit C to the Severance Plan (for the individuals listed on
      SCHEDULE 5.7(i)(i) or Section 6(a)(iii)(B) of the Employment Agreement
      (but, for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall not be responsible for, and
      Seller shall indemnify Buyer with respect to, any tax gross-up benefits
      associated with such payments) and (y) Sellers shall, in accordance with
      the Rabbi Trust (as defined below), fully and irrevocably fund the trusts
      contemplated by Section 6 of the Severance Plan and Section 11 of the
      Employment Agreement (the "RABBI TRUST") with the aggregate present value
      on the Closing Date of the payments potentially payable pursuant to
      Sections 5 and 7 of the Severance Plan (for such individuals listed on
      SCHEDULE 5.7(i)(i) and Sections 6 and 12 of the Employment Agreement and
      for which Sellers have responsibility pursuant to clause (x) of SECTION
      5.7(i)(ii)(C), it being understood and agreed that any severance or
      termination benefits ultimately payable under such arrangements for which
      Sellers have responsibility pursuant to clause (x) of SECTION
      5.7(i)(ii)(C) will be satisfied first, and exclusively, by the Rabbi Trust
      with any remaining balance paid by Buyer, subject to indemnity and
      reimbursement of Buyer by Sellers for any such amounts ultimately paid by
      Buyer.

            (iii) Cooperation. For purposes of complying with the terms set
      forth in SECTION 5.7(i), each party shall cooperate with and make
      available to the other parties and their respective representatives all
      information, records, data and working papers, and shall permit reasonable
      access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in
      connection with the determination of (A) the amount Sellers are obligated
      to contribute to the Rabbi Trust prior to the Closing Date and (B) the
      amount of any 280G excise taxes incurred by Company Employees in
      connection with, or arising out of, the transactions contemplated hereby
      and the amount of any tax gross-up obligations related thereto. Without
      limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers will provide Buyer with
      calculations of the amounts Sellers contribute to the Rabbi Trust,
      including without limitation all data used to complete such calculations.
      Buyer and its advisors will have ten (10) Business Days to review such
      calculations and data. If Buyer reasonably objects to the calculations
      within the time period set forth above, then Cooper and Buyer jointly
      shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute and whose fees
      shall be borne equally by Cooper and Buyer. The determination by the
      Arbitration Firm shall be binding on the parties.

            (j) Retiree Welfare Benefits. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall assume (or cause the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries, if applicable,
to continue to honor), to the extent not otherwise required by or resulting
from, operation of Law or collective bargaining agreements, all post-employment
and post-retirement welfare benefit obligations with respect to all Active
Company Employees and Former Employees, and their respective spouses and
dependents for claims incurred on and after the Closing Date and Sellers shall
retain or assume all such obligations for claims incurred prior to the Closing
Date. Former Employees with respect to whom post-employment and post-retirement
welfare benefit obligations exist are listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(j) (which schedule
shall be delivered on or prior to the Closing). Buyer shall establish a
post-retirement welfare benefit plan ("BUYER'S PRB PLAN") for the benefit of the
Active Company Employees and Former Employees and their respective spouses and
dependents that provides benefits that are substantially comparable to the
benefits provided under Sellers' post-retirement welfare plan. Benefits under
Buyer's PRB Plan may not be decreased or

                                       51
<PAGE>

terminated prior to December 31, 2005 (or in the case of Union Employees, until
the expiration of the applicable collective bargaining agreement).

            (k) Health Care and Dependent Care Spending Accounts. Active Company
Employees who have health care spending accounts or dependent care spending
accounts, on the Closing Date, under any Seller Benefit Plan ("COOPER'S FLEXIBLE
ACCOUNT PLAN") will continue to participate in Cooper's Flexible Account Plan
with respect to the health care spending accounts or dependent care spending
accounts for claims incurred through December 31, 2004. Effective on and after
January 1, 2005, such Active Company Employees will participate in one or more
comparable plans of Buyer.

            (l) Continuation Coverage. The Sellers shall have the sole
responsibility for "continuation coverage" benefits provided on and after the
Closing Date under Seller Benefit Plans for all Active Company Employees and
Former Employees and "qualified beneficiaries" of Active Company Employees and
Former Employees for whom a "qualifying event" occurs before or on the Closing
Date, provided that with respect to Active Company Employees and "qualified
beneficiaries" for whom a qualifying event occurs on the Closing Date and who
elect continuation coverage under Seller Benefit Plans (i) Seller shall make
such coverage available to such individuals on the same basis (including premium
cost) as is generally provided to active employees of Seller and (ii) Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for any such coverage actually provided at 100% of the
applicable premium for such period. The terms "continuation coverage,"
"qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying event" shall have the meanings
ascribed to them under Section 4980B of the Code and sections 601-608 of ERISA
or the relevant Seller Benefit Plan policy.

            (m) Nonqualified Plans. Effective as of the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall assume (or cause the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries, if applicable, to
assume) all liabilities under the nonqualified plans and arrangements identified
on SCHEDULE 5.7(m) ("COOPER'S SERP") related to the Active Company Employees and
Former Employees. Buyer shall establish (or cause the Sold Companies and
Subsidiaries, if applicable, to establish) a non-qualified supplemental
executive retirement plan for the benefit of such Active Company Employees and
Former Employees, which shall provide the benefits under Cooper's SERP the
liability for which is assumed by Buyer pursuant to this SECTION 5.7(m) to the
extent accrued on the financial statements as of the Closing Date, which
accruals will be computed in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and Seller shall retain and assume any remaining liabilities
under Cooper's SERP.

            (n) (i) U.S. Workers' Compensation. This SECTION 5.7(n)(i) applies
solely to workers' compensation arrangements maintained in the United States.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Buyer shall be solely
responsible for all Liabilities and obligations arising under workers'
compensation arrangements with respect to Active Company Employees and Former
Employees to the extent such Liability or obligation relates to claims arising
from accidents or illnesses occurring during the period from and including the
Closing Date and thereafter and (B) Sellers and their subsidiaries (other than
the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries) shall be solely responsible for (x) all
Liabilities and obligations arising under workers' compensation arrangements for
any individuals who are not Active Company Employees or Former Employees and (y)
except as otherwise set forth in this SECTION 5.7(n)(i), all Liabilities and
obligations arising under workers' compensation arrangements with respect to
Active Company Employees and Former Employees to the extent such Liability or
obligation relates to accidents or illnesses occurring during the period prior
to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, Liability for any
retroactive workers' compensation premiums attributable to such period
("PRE-CLOSING WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS"); provided that with respect to any
Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation Claims under any self insured workers'
compensation arrangements (including the deductible portion of any insured
workers' compensation arrangements and any amount in excess of the per incident
maximum under any insured workers' compensation arrangements) ("PRE-CLOSING SELF
INSURED WORKERS'

                                       52
<PAGE>

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS") which remain unsatisfied on the Closing Date, Buyer
shall reimburse Sellers for (and shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from
and against) the cost of satisfying such Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation
Claims under such Pre-Closing Self Insured Workers' Compensation Arrangements,
including a ratable portion (i.e., attributable to only Active Employees' and
Former Employees' Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation Claims) of the cost of any
self-insurance fee paid to be self-insured in states in which the Sellers
maintain Pre-Closing Self Insured Workers' Compensation Arrangements and a
ratable portion (i.e., attributable to only Active Employees' and Former
Employees' Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation Claims) of the cost of any letter
of credit securing the Seller's obligation to satisfy such Pre-Closing Workers'
Compensation Claims on an "as paid basis" (or as soon as practicable thereafter)
and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Seller and the
existing third party administrators currently administering such Pre-Closing
Self Insured Workers' Compensation Arrangements to establish Buyer escrow
accounts with such third party administrators, as of, or as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date, to enable Buyer to pre-fund approximately one month
of such Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation Claims in lieu of Seller's payment of
such Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation Claims subject to Buyer's reimbursement
obligation. Sellers and Buyer shall cause the appropriate personnel of the
Sellers and the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries, respectively, to cooperate
following the Closing in the administration of the workers' compensation
arrangements described in this SECTION 5.7(n)(i). In addition, Buyer agrees to
use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into negotiations for new
arrangements, on commercially reasonable and market normative terms, with third
party administrators and/or any applicable insurance companies and governmental
authorities as may be necessary to enable the Buyer to assume liability for the
administration and satisfaction of such Pre-Closing Workers' Compensation Claims
under the Pre-Closing Self Insured Workers' Compensation Arrangements and, if
permitted by such insurance companies, with respect to Pre-Closing Workers'
Compensation Claims which are insured claims, without further involvement of, or
liability of, the Seller, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.
Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in
such negotiations and assumption of liability.

            (ii) UK Employer's Liability . This SECTION 5.7(n)(ii) applies
      solely to employer's liability arrangements maintained in the United
      Kingdom. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) Buyer shall
      be solely responsible for all Liabilities and obligations arising in
      respect of claims made against a Sold Company or a Subsidiary by Active
      Company Employees and Former Employees to the extent such Liability or
      obligation relates to claims made against a Subsidiary or a Sold Company
      arising from accidents or illnesses occurring during the period from and
      including the Closing Date and thereafter and (B) Sellers and their
      subsidiaries (other than the Sold Companies or a Subsidiary) shall be
      solely responsible for (x) all Liabilities and obligations arising under
      employer's liability arrangements for any individuals who are not Active
      Company Employees or Former Employees and (y) except as otherwise set
      forth in this SECTION 5.7(n)(ii), for all Liabilities and obligations
      arising in respect of an employer liability insurance policy maintained by
      Sellers or one of their subsidiaries (other than the Sold Companies or a
      Subsidiary) with respect to claims made by Active Company Employees and
      Former Employees to the extent such Liability or obligation relates to
      accidents or illnesses occurring during the period prior to the Closing
      Date, including, without limitation, Liability for any retroactive
      employer liability insurance premiums attributable to such period
      ("PRE-CLOSING EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY INSURANCE CLAIMS"); provided that with
      respect to any Pre-Closing Employer's Liability Insurance Claims that are
      subject to an excess or deductible (whether individual or aggregate) which
      remain unsatisfied on the Closing Date, Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for
      (and shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and against) the cost
      of satisfying the deductible or excess portion of any such Pre-Closing
      Employer's Liability Insurance Claims under such employer's liability
      insurance including a ratable portion (i.e., attributable to only Active
      Company Employees' and Former Employees' Pre-Closing Employers' Liability

      Insurance Claims) of the cost of any letter of credit securing the
      Sellers' obligation to satisfy such Pre-Closing Employer's Liability
      Insurance Claims on an "as paid basis" (or as soon as practicable
      thereafter) and use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
      Sellers and the existing third party administrators currently
      administering such Pre-Closing Employer's Liability Insurance Claims to
      establish Buyer escrow accounts with such third party administrators, as
      of, or as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, to enable Buyer
      to pre-fund approximately one month of the deductible or excess portion of
      such Pre-Closing Employer's Liability Insurance Claims in lieu of Sellers'
      payment of such deductible or excess portion of Pre-Closing Employer's
      Liability Insurance Claims subject to Buyer's reimbursement obligation.
      Sellers and Buyer shall cause the appropriate personnel of the Sellers and
      the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries, respectively, to cooperate
      following the Closing in the administration of the Employer's Liability
      Insurance arrangements described in this SECTION 5.7(n)(ii). In addition,
      Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into
      negotiations for new arrangements, on commercially reasonable and market
      normative terms, with applicable insurance companies as may be necessary
      to enable the Buyer to assume liability for the administration and
      satisfaction of such deductible or excess portion of Pre-Closing
      Employer's Liability Insurance Claims under the employer's liability
      insurance arrangements and, if permitted by such insurance companies, with
      respect to Pre-Closing Employer's Liability Insurance Claims which are
      insured claims, without further involvement of, or liability of, the
      Sellers, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date. Sellers agree
      to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in such
      negotiations and assumption of liability.

            (iii) Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate following the Closing Date
      in the provision of all documents, information, evidence and materials in
      their possession (or in the possession of any of their Affiliates)
      reasonably requested by the other with respect to any Pre-Closing Workers'
      Compensation Claim or Pre-Closing Employer's Liability Claim, as
      applicable, for or with respect to which Buyer, the Sold Companies or any
      Subsidiary is responsible in accordance with this SECTION 5.7(n). Sellers
      shall provide Buyer with supporting documentation evidencing the
      calculation of Buyer's reimbursement obligation set forth in this SECTION
      5.7(n), which calculation shall be subject to Buyer's review and approval.
      If Buyer disputes such calculation and such dispute cannot in good faith
      be resolved between Buyer and Sellers, then Buyer and Sellers jointly
      shall engage the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute and the
      Arbitration Firm's fees shall be borne equally by Buyer and Sellers. The
      determination by the Arbitration Firm shall be binding on the Buyer and
      Sellers.

            (o) Annual Bonuses. Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to all
Company Employees any bonuses that are earned and become due, or would be paid
in accordance with Sellers' past practice and in the ordinary course, prior to
the Closing Date under the Seller Benefit Plans or any other annual incentive
compensation plans of the Sellers or their Affiliates.

            (p) Required Contributions. On or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall make, or shall cause to be made, all contributions (including without
limitation, all employer matching or other contributions and employee salary
reduction contributions) to and payments from any Seller Benefit Plan in respect
of any Company Employees (except those distributions to be made from a trust
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) that pursuant to the Seller Benefit
Plans or in accordance with Sellers' past practice and in the ordinary course,
become due or would normally be paid prior to the Closing Date.

            (q) Employees on Leave. Active Company Employees who are absent from
work as of the Closing Date because of disability and who are participants in
the long-term disability insurance plan maintained by Sellers (the "SELLER'S
LONG-TERM DISABILITY PLAN") shall continue to be covered with

                                       54
<PAGE>

respect to such disability under the Seller's Long-Term Disability Plan
following the Closing for as long as such coverage remains in effect under such
plan as in effect from time to time.

            (r) Cooperation. The parties agree to furnish each other with such
information concerning employees, employee payroll and employee benefit plans,
subject to confidentiality and privacy considerations, and to take all such
other action, as is necessary and appropriate to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby.

            (s) Siebe Automotive Pension Plan. Cooper-Standard Automotive UK
Fluid Systems Limited ("CSA UK Fluid") shall continue as the sponsoring company
of the Siebe Automotive Pension Plan (the "SIEBE PLAN") subject to the
Definitive Trust Deed and Rules of the Siebe Plan dated 31 March 2000, as
subsequently amended (the "SIEBE RULES"), provided that the Sellers shall,
subject to the provisions of this SECTION 5.7(s), reimburse and indemnify Buyer,
and hold Buyer harmless, for the amount of the Applicable Percentage (as defined
below) of the actual contributions made to the Siebe Plan on and after the
Closing Date (other than the portions of such contributions that are made by CSA
UK Fluid to fund the future service benefits of Active Company Employees of CSA
UK Fluid) and of the reasonably and properly incurred out-of-pocket expenses of
the Siebe Plan for external actuaries and legal advisors and the trustee on and
after the Closing Date (collectively, the "PERIODIC COSTS"). The Applicable
Percentage as of the Closing Date shall be determined by the actuary appointed
by the trustee of the Siebe Plan as appointed under section 47 of the Pensions
1995 Act (the "SIEBE ACTUARY") as soon as practicable following the Closing Date
and be approved by an actuary appointed by Buyer (the "BUYER'S ACTUARY") and, if
requested by Sellers, an actuary appointed by Sellers (the "SELLERS' ACTUARY").
Seller shall establish an escrow account, as of the Closing Date, and the
Sellers shall pre-fund approximately three months of the Periodic Costs (as
reasonably determined by the then-current Siebe Actuary) from which the Buyer
may draw funds to satisfy the Sellers reimbursement obligation as it becomes due
from time to time. Sellers shall also retain liability for and shall reimburse
and indemnify Buyer and hold Buyer harmless, for the amount of the Applicable
Percentage (as of the later of the termination date specified for the purpose of
Clause 28.2.2 of the Siebe Rules and the commencement of winding up of the Siebe
Plan) of any wind-up or termination liability payable by CSA UK Fluid or any
successor thereof as sponsoring company to the Siebe Plan on any wind-up or
termination of the Siebe Plan on or after the Closing Date. If the Buyer's
Actuary and/or the Sellers' Actuary does not approve of the Applicable
Percentage as of the Closing Date within thirty (30) Business Days following its
receipt of such calculation, then Sellers and Buyer shall jointly appoint a
mutually acceptable independent actuary (failing agreement such actuary shall be
appointed by the then President of the Institute of Actuaries) to determine the
Applicable Percentage, and the fees of such independent actuary shall be borne
equally by Sellers and Buyer. The Buyer's Actuary, the Sellers' Actuary and the
independent actuary shall be supplied with such data by the Buyer as they may
reasonably request for the purpose of the approval of the Applicable Percentage.
The determination by such independent actuary shall in the absence of manifest
error be binding on the parties. After the Closing, the Applicable Percentage
and the Periodic Costs shall be determined by the Siebe Actuary at each
actuarial valuation of the Siebe Plan subject to approval by the Sellers'
Actuary and the Buyer's Actuary. If the Sellers' Actuary and the Buyer's Actuary
do not approve of the Applicable Percentage or the Periodic Costs as determined
from time to time after the Closing Date within thirty (30) Business Days
following their receipt of such calculation, then Sellers and Buyer shall
jointly appoint a mutually acceptable independent actuary (failing agreement
such actuary shall be appointed by the then President of the Institute of
Actuaries) to determine the Applicable Percentage and the Periodic Costs, and
the fees of such independent actuary shall be borne equally by Sellers and
Buyer. Any such independent actuary shall act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator. The determination by such independent actuary shall, in the absence
of manifest error, be binding on the parties.

                                       55

            (ii) The Applicable Percentage shall be calculated (as a percentage)
      as the ratio of "A" divided by "B" where:

            "A" equals the liability in respect of Discontinued Business
            Employees and all other deferred pensioners or pensioners of the
            Siebe Plan who at Closing were pensioners or deferred pensioners ;
            and

            "B" equals the liability in respect of all members of the Siebe Plan
            (including Discontinued Business Employees and all other deferred
            pensioners or pensioners).

            "A" and "B" shall be calculated using the assumptions and methods in
      the Ongoing Basis used in the most recent actuarial valuation, updated
      from time to time, or on wind-up, the actual costs of discharging the
      liabilities.

            (iii) Subject to the provisions of this SECTION 5.7(s), the Siebe
      Plan shall be administered as set forth in this clause (iii).

                  (A) The Buyer and CSA UK Fluid shall have sole responsibility
            for the administration and conduct of the Siebe Plan and shall
            procure that the Siebe Plan is administered in all respects in
            accordance with applicable Law and the Siebe Rules.

                  (B) Sellers shall be entitled (at their own expense) from time
            to time on reasonable notice to Buyer, to examine, or have their
            representative examine, the books and records of CSA UK Fluid and of
            the Siebe Plan to confirm the level of contributions made by CSA UK
            Fluid to the Siebe Plan and that the expenses of operating the Siebe
            Plan have been properly incurred.

                  (C) The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
            avoid a wind-up of the Siebe Plan.

                  (D) The Buyer shall not amend the Siebe Plan if such amendment
            would have the effect of materially increasing the obligations of
            the Sellers under this SECTION 5.7(s) without the prior written
            consent of the Sellers, other than such amendments as are required
            by applicable Law.

            (t) Secunded Employees. Prior to the Closing Date, Cooper shall
cause the employment of the employees listed on SCHEDULE 5.7(t) (who are, on the
date of this Agreement, active employees of Cooper who are employed primarily in
the Business) (the "SECUNDED EMPLOYEES") to be transferred to Cooper-Standard
Automotive Inc. ("CSA"). From the time of such transfer until December 31, 2005
(the "SECUNDMENT PERIOD"), Buyer shall cause CSA to permit the secundment of the
Secunded Employees to Cooper with respect to up to 50% of their working time (as
requested by Cooper) to perform the duties for Cooper set forth on SCHEDULE
5.7(t). Cooper shall reimburse CSA for the pro rata portion of the employment
costs incurred by CSA with respect to the Secunded Employees during the
Secundment Period.

            (u) No Third Party Beneficiary Rights; No Right to Employment.
Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the employees of
the Sellers, the Buyer, the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates, any rights or remedies, including any right to benefits or
employment, or continued benefits or employment, for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

                                       56

            (v) Canadian Salaried Plan. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 5.7(v)
(which Schedule shall be delivered on or prior to the Closing), the Oliver
Rubber Employee who participates in the Canadian Salaried Plan shall,
immediately prior to Closing, cease to participate in and accrue benefits under
all applicable Company Foreign Benefit Plans, including, for greater certainty,
the Canadian Salaried Plan. The Sellers shall provide the Buyer (or cause to be
provided to the Buyer) such information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
concerning service by the Oliver Rubber Employee with the Seller or Affiliate of
the Seller, as applicable, for the purposes of calculating benefits payable to
such Oliver Rubber Employee under the Canadian Salaried Plan, including without
limitation, advice concerning the date the Oliver Rubber Employee retires or has
his employment terminated by the Seller or Affiliate of the Seller, as
applicable, and such advice is to be provided within five Business Days of such
Oliver Rubber Employee's retirement or termination date; further, Sellers agree
to indemnify Buyer and any applicable Sold Company or Subsidiary for any costs
the Buyer or any applicable Sold Company or Subsidiary may suffer or incur
(including additional funding costs and reasonable legal and actuarial fees) as
a result of any required or proposed partial wind-up of the Canadian Salaried
Plan that applies in relation to any pension entitlements of any Canadian
Salaried Plan member where such partial wind-up is required or proposed by
Sellers or a Governmental Authority as a result of action taken by Sellers prior
to the Closing Date, including, without limitation, the termination of the
Oliver Rubber Employee.

            5.8 LABOR MATTERS. (a) The Buyer agrees that from and after the
Closing the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities shall be
responsible for any notification required under the WARN Act or the Employment
Standards Act, Ontario with respect to the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and
the Venture Entities with respect to employment losses which occur after the
Closing Date; provided that Buyer shall not cause any employment losses with
respect to the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries within the ninety (90) days (16
weeks in Ontario) following the Closing where such employment losses would give
rise to an obligation of the Sellers or the Sold Companies, Subsidiaries and the
Venture Entities to have given any notification required under the WARN Act with
the ninety (90) days (or the Employment Standards Act, Ontario with the sixteen
(16) weeks) preceding the Closing. Each Seller agrees that between the date
hereof and the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, it will cause the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries
and with respect to the Venture Entities, to the extent the Sellers have the
authority and control to do so, not to effect or permit a "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" as these terms are defined in the WARN Act or "mass termination"
as defined in the Employment Standards Act, Ontario with respect to any member
of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities without
notifying the Buyer in advance and without complying with the notice
requirements and all other provisions of the WARN Act or the Employment
Standards Act, Ontario. The Sellers will also notify the Buyer of, and obtain
its consent to, prior to the Closing, all layoffs and terminations at any
"single site of employment" or "facility or operating unit within a single site
of employment" that occur within ninety (90) days of the Closing and that, in
the aggregate, exceed twenty percent (20%) of the workforce or 25 or more
employees at either the "single site of employment" or a "facility or operating
unit", which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Buyer will take no
action or make any statement prior to Closing that will obligate the Sellers to
provide a group of employees with WARN notification or notice under the
Employment Standards Act, Ontario.

            (b) The Sellers and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in
connection with any required notification to, or any required consultation with,
or the provision of documents and information to, the employees, employee
representatives, work councils, unions, labor boards and relevant government
agencies and governmental officials concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with respect to non-U.S. Employees of any of the Sold Companies,
the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities so that such Persons may render advice
as required in accordance with Law.

                                       57

            (c) The parties agree that, in connection with the sale of stock
pursuant to this Agreement (the "TRANSACTION"), the Sellers, Buyer and Sold
Companies, Subsidiaries and Venture Entities shall comply with any and all
obligations imposed under the National Labor Relations Act (the "NLRA"). With
respect to each bargaining unit in which employees of the Sold Companies,
Subsidiaries or Venture Entities are represented by a labor organization or
labor organizations, Buyer agrees that the Sold Companies, Subsidiaries and
Venture Entities as a result of the Transaction will satisfy the following
requirements at the earliest time permitted by applicable Law: (i) to recognize
the labor organization as the bargaining representative for the employees within
the existing bargaining unit; and (ii) to comply with, for the remainder of its
stated term, the existing collective bargaining agreement between each such
labor organization and the respective Sold Company, Subsidiary or Venture
Entity, or to be bound by any other collective bargaining agreement(s)
negotiated and entered into between the labor organization and the Sold Company,
Subsidiary or Venture Entity establishing the terms and conditions of employment
for bargaining unit employees. Should a dispute arise between any labor
organization(s) and the Sellers, the Buyer and/or any Sold Companies,
Subsidiaries or Venture Entities concerning compliance with any sale,
successorship or similar provision contained in any existing collective
bargaining agreement, the Sellers and/or the Buyer (whichever is appropriate)
agree that the respective Sold Company, Subsidiary or Venture Entity will
process the dispute under any applicable grievance and arbitration provisions of
the collective bargaining agreement covering the dispute, provided that the
dispute is the subject of a valid grievance filed in accordance with the terms
of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. This SECTION 5.8(c) shall not
prevent the Sellers, Buyer or any Sold Company, Subsidiary or Venture Entity
from initiating or defending against any proceedings at any time before the NLRB
or any court concerning any such dispute or other matters properly within the
jurisdiction of the NLRB or court; nor shall this SECTION 5.8(c) require the
arbitration of any grievance that is not arbitrable under the applicable
collective bargaining agreement or require the Buyer and/or any Sold Companies,
Subsidiaries or Venture Entities, contrary to the parties' understanding of
applicable Law, to recognize any labor organization or comply with or be bound
by any collective bargaining agreement prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers
and Buyer further agree that the Sellers will provide notice and the opportunity
for bargaining with any labor organization(s) that represent employees of the
Sold Companies, Subsidiaries or Venture Entities as may be required under
applicable Law and nothing in this agreement shall prevent or preclude such
bargaining from taking place in compliance with applicable Law. The phrase
"existing collective bargaining agreement" for purposes of this SECTION 5.8(c)
shall mean those collective bargaining agreements as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.12.
The requirements of this SECTION 5.8(c) shall apply to Venture Entities only to
the extent that Buyer controls such entities.

            5.9 CONTACT WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. Prior to the Closing or
the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the
Buyer and its representatives may contact and communicate with the Company
Employees (other than the executive officers), customers, suppliers and
licensors of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby only with the prior written
consent of the Sellers, which may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, except that consent may be conditioned upon a designee of the
Sellers being present at any such meeting or conference.

            5.10 INTERCOMPANY DEBT. On or prior to the day before the Closing,
(a) each of the Sold Companies that has positive Net Intercompany Amounts shall
distribute such Net Intercompany Amounts to its shareholders and (b) the Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, eliminate any Net Intercompany
Amounts of each of the Sold Companies that has negative Net Intercompany Amounts
and such elimination shall be treated as a contribution of capital to such Sold
Company by its parent with the result that there will be no intercompany
receivables or intercompany payables between the Sold Companies, the
Subsidiaries or the Venture Entities, on the one hand, and the Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture
Entities), on the other hand, at the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt,
any intercompany receivables or payables between the Sold

                                       58
<PAGE>

Companies, the Subsidiaries and/or the Venture Entities shall remain in place
and not be cancelled. As used herein, "NET INTERCOMPANY AMOUNTS" means with
respect to each Sold Company (i) all intercompany receivables due to such Sold
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities from the Sellers and their
Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture
Entities), less (ii) all intercompany payables of such Sold Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities to the Sellers and their Affiliates (other
than the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Venture Entities). As soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a
schedule that sets forth the approximate amount of the intercompany receivables
or intercompany payables between a Sold Company, Subsidiary or Venture Entity,
on the one hand, and another Sold Company, Subsidiary or Venture Entity, on the
other hand, all as of the most recent practicable date.

            5.11 MINIMUM CASH REQUIREMENT. Sellers shall ensure that, as of the
Closing, each of the Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries will maintain
sufficient cash to satisfy any requirements of Law.

            5.12 CORPORATE NAMES. Except as otherwise set forth in this SECTION
5.12, from and after the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries to remove or cover the name "Cooper Tire," "Cooper,"
"Cooper-Standard" and any trademarks, trade names, brandmarks, brand names,
trade dress or logos confusingly similar to such name (the "RETAINED NAMES")
from all signs, billboards, advertising materials, telephone listings, labels,
stationery, office forms, packaging or other materials of the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries (other than materials for purely internal circulation, for
which removal or coverage is impracticable). Except as set forth in this SECTION
5.12, the Buyer shall neither use nor permit any of the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries to use the Retained Names in connection with the businesses of the
Sold Companies and the Subsidiaries or otherwise, except for neutral,
non-trademark use to describe the history of the Business or as required by Law.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in SECTION 5.12(a), the
Sellers hereby grant to the Buyer an exclusive worldwide, royalty-free license
to use (i) "Cooper-Standard" and the "Cooper-Standard" logo and accompanying
goodwill with respect to such Retained Names listed on SCHEDULE 5.12
(collectively, the "TRADEMARKS") as or as part of a trademark, service mark,
domain name, trade name, corporate name, logo or other source-indicator and (ii)
the name of Cooper SaiYang Wuhu Automotive Co., Ltd. as the corporate name of
the 60%-owned Chinese subsidiary of CSA (Barbados) Investment Co. Ltd. from the
Closing Date until the earlier of (A) the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, or (B) an initial public offering of the equity interests of the Business.
The Buyer may sublicense the above rights as necessary exclusively to the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries, and may assign the above rights to any purchaser
or acquiror of the Business in any change-in-control or similar transaction,
whether by a merger, sale, restructuring or otherwise. During the term of the
license (A) Sellers will not (1) license or sell the Trademarks to any other
Person (except in connection with a Change of Control of Cooper) or (2) license
or sell (except in connection with a Change of Control of Cooper) the name
"Cooper" to a Competitive Business other than, subject to SECTION 5.18 of this
Agreement, any joint venture or similar partnership or entity to which either
Seller or one of their Affiliates is a partner or similar participant so long as
such joint venture or similar partnership or entity does not use the "Cooper"
name as part of a Competitive Business, and (B) neither Sellers nor any of their
Affiliates will use the Trademarks in connection with a Competitive Business;
provided that nothing shall prohibit Sellers and their Affiliates from using the
Trademarks in a neutral, non-trademark manner to describe the history of the
Business or as required by Law. After this license expires, the Buyer, the Sold
Companies and the Subsidiaries shall not use the Trademarks in connection with
their businesses or otherwise, except for neutral, non-trademark use to describe
the history of the Business or as required by Law.

            (c) Buyer and Sellers agree to report to the other any acts of
infringement of the Trademarks by a third party. Buyer and Sellers further agree
to cooperate in either party's efforts to cease

                                       59
<PAGE>

any such infringing activity. The Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers have the
first right to enforce any and all rights relating to the Trademarks at Sellers'
sole cost and expense; provided, that if (i) Sellers take any actions to enforce
their rights to the Trademarks at the request of Buyer or, (ii) Sellers' actions
to enforce their rights to the Trademarks solely benefit the Buyer, then Buyer
will be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection therewith, except if
the Proceeding is the result of or relates to a breach by the Sellers of any of
the representations and warranties contained in SECTION 3.13. Sellers
acknowledge that if Sellers choose not to enforce such rights, Buyer may do so;
provided, that Buyer may not take any action that would impair Sellers' rights
to the Trademarks or any portion thereof or otherwise bind Sellers without the
prior written consent of Sellers. If Buyer enforces such rights, Buyer will be
responsible for all expenses and fees incurred in connection therewith, except
if the Proceeding is the result of or relates to a breach by Sellers of any of
the representations and warranties contained in SECTION 3.13. Sellers and Buyer
each agree to cooperate with the other as necessary in any such Proceeding.

            (d) The Buyer acknowledges that in order to preserve the
distinctiveness and goodwill of the Trademarks, Sellers must have the right to
ensure that the Buyer's use of the Trademarks meets minimum standards of
quality. The Buyer shall at all times and in all respects continue to use the
Trademarks consistent with the past practices of Sellers, including producing
goods of substantially the same quality as currently produced, so as not to
injure the Trademarks or the goodwill associated therewith, and any use
consistent therewith is hereby deemed approved without submission to Sellers.
The Buyer further agrees to furnish to the Sellers, at reasonable intervals and
upon written request, any documents and/or information reasonably necessary to
effectuate its review to determine that the standards of quality control have
been consistent with the terms of this SECTION 5.12(d). In the event that the
Sellers determine that any of the standards are not met, it shall provide notice
to the Buyer and a reasonable opportunity to cure such defects.

            (e) For 180 days from the Closing Date, the Sellers will, in a
reasonable manner on their websites, (i) inform all Internet users as to the
Buyer's new ownership of the Business and (ii) direct interested Internet users
to a website of the Buyer's selection. The parties will cooperate in good faith
to (x) transfer to the Buyer and (y) allow the Buyer to use, in each case in
accordance with applicable Law and the Sellers' privacy policy, all content and
information collected from or used in connection with the Sellers' websites with
respect to the Business.

            (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the
monetary damages for any material breach of the requirements of SECTION 5.12
would be inadequate, and agrees and consents that without intending to limit any
additional remedies that may be available, temporary and permanent injunctive
and other equitable relief may be granted without proof of actual damage or
inadequacy of legal remedy in any Proceeding that may be brought to enforce any
of the provisions of SECTION 5.12.

            5.13 RESTRUCTURING. Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise
modified pursuant to SECTION 2.6 hereof, the Sellers shall cause the
transactions described in SCHEDULE B (the "RESTRUCTURING") not yet completed as
of the date of this Agreement to be consummated in a manner reasonably

information requested in connection therewith. The Buyer and the Sellers shall
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the

commercially reasonable efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible with all

divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of any of the Sold
Companies or the Subsidiaries (or otherwise take any action that limits the
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the
businesses, product lines, or assets of any of the Sold Companies or the
Subsidiaries), so long as conditioned upon, and not occurring prior to, the
Closing, as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any Governmental Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that Buyer shall
not be required to take any such actions to the extent it would have a material
adverse effect on the Business after Closing; and provided further, that any
sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses be on terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer.

            (b) The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things

contemplated hereby, including securing consents or waivers of third parties
listed in SCHEDULE 2.5(a)(vi). Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist the Sellers in obtaining the consents or waivers of third
parties listed in SCHEDULE 2.5(a)(vi).

subsidiaries, the Sold Companies and Subsidiaries and/or their respective
predecessors, covering any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense relating to
the Business (including products and current and former employees and directors)
arising out of occurrences prior to the Closing. Each Seller agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts so that each of Buyer, the Sold Companies and
the Subsidiaries shall have the right, power and authority in its own name or in

under any such policies and to receive directly recoveries thereunder. Upon
request of the Buyer, Seller shall provide historical loss information with

            5.17 NOTICE OF EVENTS. (a) During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Buyer shall give prompt written notice to the
Sellers of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that has caused, or
could reasonably be expected to cause, any representation or warranty made by it
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) any material failure on
its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. In addition, the Buyer shall
promptly notify the Sellers if the Buyer obtains knowledge that any of the
representations and warranties of the Sellers in this Agreement and the
schedules hereto (including the updated schedules) are not true and correct in
all material respects, or if the Buyer obtains knowledge of any material errors
in, or omissions from, the schedules (including the updated schedules) to this
Agreement.

            (b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing
Date or the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Sellers shall give prompt written notice to the Buyer if they become aware

material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date; and (ii) any material failure on the Sellers part to comply with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder. If any such event requires any change to the Sellers' schedules
to this Agreement with respect to ARTICLE III, the Sellers shall promptly
deliver to the Buyer a supplement to the schedules specifying such change;
provided that any such supplement shall not be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether the conditions precedent in ARTICLE VI are satisfied or
for purposes of indemnification as set forth in ARTICLE VIII (except as set
forth below); and provided further, that if any supplement reflects any state of
facts, change, occurrence or event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
result in the failure of any condition precedent set forth in ARTICLE VI, Buyer
may, at its option, cause this Agreement to be terminated without any liability
to Buyer by giving written notice to Sellers upon the earlier of (i) a date
within five (5) days after receipt of the supplement to the schedule and (ii)

indemnification as set forth in ARTICLE VIII) by supplementing the applicable
schedule. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 5.17, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that final SCHEDULES 5.7(e), 5.7(f), 5.7(j) and 5.7(v)
will not be delivered or finalized until on or prior to the Closing. Buyer will

shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers, their respective
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees,
agents, and representatives (collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS")
from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Person arising out of or related to (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty by Buyer contained in this Agreement (reading such
representation or warranty without regard to materiality, material adverse
effect or similar qualification) whether made upon execution of this Agreement
or at Closing as contemplated by SECTION 6.2(a) and the certificate to be
delivered at Closing pursuant to SECTION 6.2(c), (ii) any non-fulfillment or
breach by Buyer of any covenant, obligation or agreement hereunder, (iii) any
payments required to be made by the Sellers after the Closing under the
guarantees set forth as items 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 20 and 21 on SCHEDULE 3.6(b)
and (iv) obligations arising following the Closing under the letters of credit
to be maintained by Cooper pursuant to SECTION 5.21.

            (b) None of the Seller Indemnified Persons will be entitled to
recover from the Buyer for any Losses indemnifiable pursuant to SECTION
8.2(a)(i), unless and until the total of all Losses indemnifiable under SECTION
8.2(a)(i) exceeds the Deductible, and then only for the amount by which such
Losses exceed such amount. The Seller Indemnified Persons will not be entitled
to recover more than the Maximum Amount from the Buyer with respect to all
Losses indemnifiable pursuant to SECTION 8.2(a)(i); provided that the foregoing
limitations not apply to any obligation or liability under SECTION 8.2(a)(i)
arising out of or related to a breach of any of the representations set forth in
SECTIONS 4.2, and 4.5.

            8.3 INDEMNIFICATION AS EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except as otherwise
provided below, the indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE VIII, subject
to the limitations set forth herein, shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy
available to any party in connection with any Losses arising out of the matters
set forth in this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder;
provided, however, that nothing herein will limit in any way any such party's
remedies in respect of fraud by the other party in connection herewith or with
any Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all matters relating
to Taxes shall

                                       68
<PAGE>

be governed by SECTIONS 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6 hereof and no provision of this ARTICLE
VIII shall apply to limit, modify or offset the rights or obligations of the
parties thereunder.

            8.4 SURVIVAL. Except as set forth below, all claims for
indemnification under SECTION 8.1(a) must be asserted on or prior to the date of
the termination of the respective survival periods set forth in this SECTION
8.4, except such claims may be pursued thereafter if written notice thereof
(specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such claim) was duly given within
such period. Claims for fraud may be asserted at any time prior to the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing Date until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, except that the representations and
warranties (a) set forth in SECTIONS 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a) (other than the second
sentence thereof), 3.25, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.5 shall survive indefinitely, (b) set
forth in SECTION 3.10 shall survive as set forth in SECTION 5.5(e), (c) set
forth in SECTION 3.11 shall survive the Closing until the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, and (d) set forth in SECTION 3.15 shall survive the Closing
until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date. All claims for indemnification
under subclauses (ii)-(xiv) of SECTION 8.1(a) may be asserted at any time;
provided, however that all claims for indemnification under subclause (vi)(D) of
SECTION 8.1(a) must be asserted before the tenth anniversary of the Closing
Date, after which date no claims for indemnity may be asserted under SECTION
8.1(a)(vi)(d).

            8.5 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. (a) The amount of any Losses for
which indemnification is provided under SECTION 8.1(a) or SECTION 8.2(a) shall
be computed net of any third party insurance proceeds received by, or payable
to, an Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses (net of any expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such insurance proceeds including
the cost of maintaining any insurance policy) and any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party (net of any Tax detriment) in the Tax period
in which the indemnification payment is made in respect of any Losses for which
such indemnification payment is made. For the avoidance of doubt, such payments
shall not be reduced for additions to net operating losses. The parties agree
that any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless
otherwise required by Law.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party shall
be liable to any Indemnified Party for (i) punitive or exemplary Losses or (ii)
special, incidental, indirect or consequential Losses, except to the extent that
applicable Law would permit a party to recover lost or anticipated profits of
the Business that are reasonably foreseeable to Sellers; provided, however, that
the foregoing limitations shall not apply to the extent that such Losses consist
of a payment by the Indemnified Party in defense of or in respect of a Third
Party Claim.

            (c) For matters covered by Schedule 15: Environmental Covenant to
the Siebe Purchase Agreement Buyer Indemnified Persons to the extent such Buyer
Indemnified Persons have direct rights to indemnification pursuant to Schedule
15: Environmental Covenant to the Siebe Purchase Agreement shall not be entitled
to indemnification for Environmental Losses pursuant to SECTION 8.1(a) unless
and until such Buyer Indemnified Persons have fully complied with the provisions
of such Schedule 15 (it being understood that this condition shall not apply to
any such noncompliance that first occurred prior to the Closing Date, except to
the extent such noncompliance may be remedied following the Closing Date without
any significant cost or adverse impact to the Buyer Indemnified Persons) and the
relevant Buyer Indemnified Person has made all reasonable efforts to obtain
indemnification under the Siebe Purchase Agreement and has failed to obtain such
indemnification despite such efforts. Buyer shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause those Sold Companies and Subsidiaries that, as of
the date of this Agreement, have rights to indemnification pursuant to Schedule
15 of the Siebe Purchase

                                       69
<PAGE>

Agreement to materially comply with all of their obligations under Schedule 15
of the Siebe Purchase Agreement.

            (d) Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
and to assign to Buyer any third-party indemnities, settlements or cost sharing
agreements available or potentially available to Buyer.

            (e) Without limiting SECTION 8.5(c) of this Agreement or Schedule 15
of the Siebe Purchase Agreement in any way:

            (i) The Buyer Indemnified Persons shall cooperate with the Sellers
      and take all commercially reasonable actions to avoid and minimize
      Environmental Losses that would otherwise be subject to the
      indemnification under SECTION 8.1(a), including not soliciting or
      importuning any Governmental Authority to require any environmental
      correction, investigation, monitoring or remediation unless affirmatively
      required to do so by Law, including Environmental Laws or unless the Buyer
      Indemnified Persons reasonably believe that such actions will likely
      reduce the overall extent of such Losses (subject to Sellers' consent
      which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Buyer Indemnified
      Persons shall not conduct invasive investigations of the Real Property
      (including sampling of soil, surface water or ground water) for the sole
      purpose of identifying an Environmental Loss subject to the
      indemnification under SECTION 8.1(a).

            (ii) In addition to any other limitations on indemnification that
      may apply, with respect to any claim for indemnification any of the Buyer
      Indemnified Persons may assert regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous
      Materials, none of the Sellers shall have any obligation with respect to
      such claim to the extent of the Losses for which indemnification is
      sought:

                  (A) arise out of any breach of Buyer Indemnified Persons'
            covenants under this SECTION 8.5(e);

                  (B) without limiting SECTION 8.5(e)(i), arise out of any
            action (to address any Release, threat of Release or violation of
            Environmental Law) not required by any Governmental Authority or
            under Law, including Environmental Law or any action to meet a
            cleanup standard under Environmental Law that is more stringent or
            costly than necessary for the continued use of any property as it
            was similarly used by the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or the
            Venture Entities prior to the Closing Date, unless the Buyer
            Indemnified Persons agree to reimburse the Sellers for costs
            necessary to meet such cleanup standard;

                  (C) are ordinary costs of any post-Closing construction,
            demolition, renovation or maintenance of facilities on the Owned
            Real Property by a Buyer Indemnified Party, including any asbestos
            abatement obligations arising from such activities, but not
            including Losses that arise from a Release or threatened Release of
            Hazardous Materials or violation of Environmental Law relating
            thereto, that exists as of, or occurred or existed prior to, the
            Closing Date; or

                  (D) are, pursuant to any written agreement under which any of
            the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Venture Entities are
            entitled to assert a claim, subject to indemnification by any other
            Person, except where a Buyer, a Sold Company , a

                                       70
<PAGE>

            Subsidiary or a Venture Entity has in good faith sought and failed
            to obtain such indemnification.

            (iii) In addition, with respect to any claim that is the subject of
      this SECTION 8.5(e):

                  (A) Buyer Indemnified Persons shall notify the Sellers of any
            claim for indemnification under SECTION 8.1(a) and afford the
            Sellers the opportunity to evaluate the conditions giving rise to
            such claim prior to incurring substantial costs with respect to such
            claim for which it may seek indemnification; provided, however, that
            in the event of an emergency that presents an imminent likelihood of
            personal injury or property damage, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
            may take action to address such emergency immediately, but must
            provide verbal notice to Sellers as soon as possible with written
            follow-up notice promptly thereafter; however, Sellers may exercise
            their rights under SECTION 8.5(e)(iii)(B) as soon as feasible in the
            event of an emergency;

                  (B) the Sellers, at their sole expense, shall be entitled, but
            not obligated, to undertake, with the Buyer Indemnified Persons'
            oversight, participation and approval (not to be unreasonably
            withheld or delayed or to unreasonably result in material increased
            costs beyond those required by Law or Environmental Law), any
            investigation, remediation or other action required by Environmental
            Law (and any negotiation with Governmental Authorities regarding
            same) with respect to such matter, using all commercially reasonable
            efforts to avoid any interference with operations of the Buyer
            Indemnified Persons, and the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall afford
            the Sellers reasonable access to the relevant Real Property to
            undertake any such investigation, remediation or other action,
            subject, where such property is Leased Real Property, to the
            requirements of the relevant landlord; provided, however, that the
            Sellers shall promptly repair, restore or reimburse the Buyer
            Indemnified Persons for any damages or other costs incurred by the
            Buyer Indemnified Persons as a result of providing access under this
            SECTION 8.5(b);

                  (C) if Sellers do not assume responsibility for undertaking
            actions pursuant to SECTION 8.5(e)(iii), the Buyer Indemnified
            Persons shall undertake, with the Sellers' oversight and
            participation, in good faith, to complete such actions in a
            reasonably cost effective manner;

                  (D) to the extent there is a risk of litigation and sharing
            relevant information or communications between Sellers and Buyer
            Indemnified Persons could affect their status as privileged or
            otherwise protected, the Sellers and Buyer Indemnified Persons shall
            exchange information pursuant to the protection of a joint defense
            agreement and shall otherwise cooperate in order to facilitate the
            expeditious and cost-effective resolution of such claim; and

                  (E) where reasonably necessary to achieve the purpose of
            SECTION 8.5(e)(II)(b), the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall, at
            Sellers' request, impose environmental deed or use restrictions,
            and/or accept Sellers' installation of engineering controls on the
            Owned Real Property, provided that such restrictions or controls are
            acceptable to the relevant Governmental Authority and are in
            compliance with Law and do not prevent or inhibit any uses of such
            Owned Real Property similar to those that occurred as of the Closing
            Date.

                                       71

            8.6 PROCEDURES. Notice of Losses. As soon as is reasonably
practicable after the Sellers or the Buyer has actual knowledge of any Losses
for which indemnification is available under SECTION 8.1(a) or SECTION 8.2(a) (a
"CLAIM"), such party shall give written notice thereof (a "CLAIM NOTICE") to the
other party. A Claim Notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail, and
must indicate the amount (estimated to the extent feasible) of the Loss that has
been or will be suffered by the Indemnified Party. No delay in or failure to
give a Claim Notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party will
adversely affect any other rights or remedies that the Indemnified Party has
under this Agreement, or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such delay or
failure has not materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Each Indemnifying
Party to whom a Claim Notice is given shall respond to any Indemnified Party
that has given a Claim Notice (a "CLAIM RESPONSE") within thirty (30) days (the
"RESPONSE PERIOD") after the date the Claim Notice is given. Any Claim Response
must specify whether or not the Indemnifying Party disputes the Claim described
in the Claim Notice. If any Indemnifying Party fails to give a Claim Response
within the Response Period, such Indemnifying Party will be deemed not to
dispute the Claim described in the related Claim Notice. If any Indemnifying
Party elects not to dispute a Claim described in a Claim Notice, whether by
failing to give a timely Claim Response or otherwise, then the amount of such
Claim will be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of such Indemnifying Party
and such Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days after the last day of the applicable Response Period the amount to
which such Indemnified Party is entitled.

            (b) Third Party Claims. If any Claim Notice identifies any Claim
brought by a third person (a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), the Indemnifying Party will
have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within
sixty (60) days of receipt of such Claim Notice, to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim, with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of, and the full responsibility for paying or otherwise
discharging such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to
the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof and the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate at
its own expense in the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party may defend such Third Party Claim at the sole cost of the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnifying Party may still participate in, but not control, the
defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and
expense.

            (ii) The party responsible for the defense of any Third Party Claim
      (a "RESPONSIBLE PARTY") shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the
      other party, keep such other party informed as to the status of such Third
      Party Claim, including, without limitation, all settlement negotiations
      and offers. With respect to a Third Party Claim for which a Seller is the
      Responsible Party, the Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to make
      available to such Seller all books and records of the Buyer relating to
      such Third Party Claim and shall cooperate with such Seller in the defense
      of the Third Party Claim. No settlement or compromise or consent to the
      entry of any judgment that does not relate solely to monetary damages
      arising from any such Third Party Claim may be effected (A) by the
      Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
      (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless all
      relief provided is paid or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party and
      the Indemnified Party receives a full release in respect of the Third
      Party Claim or (B) by the Indemnified Party without the consent of the
      Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
      delayed). In no event shall an Indemnifying Party be liable for any
      settlement effected without its prior written consent.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            9.1 FEES AND EXPENSES. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements, Cooper, on behalf of the Sellers, on
the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear its own expenses and
the expenses of its Affiliates in connection with the preparation and
negotiation of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Cooper, on behalf of the Sellers, on the one
hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear the fees and expenses of any
broker or finder retained by such party or parties and their respective
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements.

            9.2 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be construed under and
governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and
to be performed in that State.

            9.3 PROJECTIONS. In connection with the Buyer's investigation of the
Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and the Business, Buyer may have received, or
may receive, from the Sellers, the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries and/or their
respective representatives certain projections and other forecasts for the
Business, and certain business plan and budget information. Buyer acknowledges
that (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, (b) Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, (c) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to them and (d) Buyer will not assert
any claim against the Sellers or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates or representatives, or hold the Sellers or any such
Persons liable, with respect thereto. Buyer acknowledges that the Sellers make
no representation or warranty with respect to such projections, forecasts or
plans and that the Sellers make only those representations and warranties
explicitly set forth in ARTICLE III. Nothing in this SECTION 9.3 shall
constitute a waiver of any rights of Buyer to assert a breach of representation
or warranty hereunder in accordance with SECTION 5.5 and ARTICLE VIII or to
assert a claim of fraud.

            9.4 AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
modified, and any provision hereof may be waived with the written consent of the
parties hereto.

            9.5 ASSIGNMENT. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties; provided that Buyer may assign
its rights or obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Buyer (other than an
Affiliate that is not a United States Person within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code) or, for collateral security purposes, to any lender
providing financing to the Buyer, any of the Sold Companies or any of their
Affiliates, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto;
provided, further, that no such assignment by Buyer shall relieve Buyer of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies hereunder (except for
Indemnified Parties in ARTICLE VIII).

            9.6 WAIVER. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement that
may be lawfully waived may be waived in writing at any time by each party, at
its sole discretion, that is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement by any party hereto will be binding only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure
to enforce any provision of or right under this Agreement will be deemed to or
will constitute a waiver of such provision or right and no waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement will be deemed to or will

                                       73
<PAGE>

constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor
will such waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

            9.7 NOTICES. (a) Any notice, demand, or communication required or
permitted to be given by any provision of this Agreement will be deemed to have
