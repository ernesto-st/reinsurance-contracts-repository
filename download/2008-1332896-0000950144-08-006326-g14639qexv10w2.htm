Lender to transfer its Commitment. The Agent shall promptly notify the remaining Lenders that each
of such Lenders shall have the right, but not the obligation, to acquire a portion of the
Commitment, pro rata based upon their relevant Commitment Percentages, of the Affected Lender (or
if any of such Lenders does not elect to purchase its pro rata share, then to such remaining
Lenders in such proportion as approved by the Agent). In the event that the Lenders do not elect
to acquire all of the Affected Lender&#146;s Commitment, then the Agent shall endeavor to obtain a new
Lender to acquire such remaining Commitment. Upon any such purchase of the Commitment of the
Affected Lender, the Affected Lender&#146;s interest in the Obligations and its rights hereunder and
under the Loan Documents shall terminate at the date of purchase, and the Affected Lender shall
promptly execute all documents reasonably requested to surrender and transfer such interest. The
purchase price for the Affected Lender&#146;s Commitment shall equal any and all amounts outstanding and

exercise any remedies arising by reason of a Default or Event of Default. Following the occurrence

of the Security Documents), if Borrower or any Guarantor fails to perform any agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents beyond any applicable period for

such Person contained in this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents which such Person shall

expenses, including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees actually incurred (including attorneys&#146; fees
incurred in any appeal) by Agent in connection therewith, shall be payable by Borrower upon demand

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reference is made to the Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement dated as of March&nbsp;10, 2008 (as the
same may hereafter be amended, the &#147;Loan Agreement&#148;) by and among Goldenboy Acquisition Corp. (the
&#147;Borrower&#148;), Codgell Spencer, Inc. (&#147;Parent&#148;), KeyBank National Association for itself and as
Agent, and the other Lenders from time to time party thereto. Terms defined in the Loan Agreement
and not otherwise defined herein are used herein as defined in the Loan Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, Parent is furnishing to you herewith (or have most recently

&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (the &#147;Balance Sheet Date&#148;). Such financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP and present fairly the consolidated financial position of Parent at the date
thereof and the results of its operations for the periods covered thereby, subject in the case of
interim statements only to normal year-end audit adjustments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This certificate is submitted in compliance with requirements of &#167;2.10(d), &#167;7.4(c) or &#167;10.12
of the Loan Agreement. If this certificate is provided under a provision other than &#167;7.4(c), the
calculations provided below are made using the consolidated financial statement of Parent as of the
Balance Sheet Date adjusted in the best good faith estimate of Borrower to give effect to the
making of a Loan, acquisition or disposition of property or other event that occasions the
preparation of this certificate; and the nature of such event and the estimate of Borrower of its
effects are set forth in reasonable detail in an attachment hereto. The undersigned officer is the
chief financial officer or chief accounting officer of Parent.

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned representative has caused the provisions of the Loan Documents to be reviewed
and have no knowledge of any Default or Event of Default. (Note: If the signer does have knowledge
of any Default or Event of Default, the form of certificate should be revised to specify the
Default or Event of Default, the nature thereof and the actions taken, being taken or proposed to
be taken by the Borrower with respect thereto.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned is providing the attached information to demonstrate compliance as of the date
hereof with the covenants described in the attachment hereto.
