          As a material inducement to the Buyer and the Brokers to enter into

provided, however, that no representation or warranty set forth in this Article
II which is deemed to be remade by the Seller as of the time of the Closing will
be false or untrue, or will be deemed to be false or untrue, as of the time of

no other proceeding or action on the part of the Seller or any Company, or any
of the Seller's or any Company's shareholders, is necessary to approve and
authorize the Seller's or any Company's execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the performance of any of its
obligations thereunder. This Agreement constitutes, and each of the other
Transaction Documents to which the Seller or a Company is a party will when

hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and limitations on the availability of equitable
remedies.

shares. Except as set forth in the preceding sentences, none of UBC, KARK-TV or
Morris of Alabama has any Equity Security outstanding or authorized or has
agreed to issue, redeem or repurchase any Equity Security. None of UBC, KARK-TV
or Morris of Alabama has any Investment in any Person, except UBC owns all of
the KARK Shares.

     2.4  Absence of Conflicts. Except for the FCC Consents, Consents required
under the Network Affiliation Agreements and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), and the Consents described
on the attached Schedule 2.4, neither the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document by the Seller or the Companies
nor the consummation by the Seller or the Companies of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby:

          (a)  does or will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any of
the provisions of, (ii) constitute a default under, (iii) result in a violation
of, (iv) give any third party the right to terminate or to accelerate any

organizational or governing document of the Seller and the Companies or any
indenture, mortgage, lease, loan agreement or other agreement, instrument or
Contract or any Legal Requirement by which the Seller or the Companies or any of
their respective assets is affected, or to which the Seller or the Companies is

                                        5

<PAGE>

Each Financial Statement (in each case including the notes thereto, if any) (i)
is in accordance with the books and records of the applicable Company, (ii) has
been prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied, subject to the lack

financial condition of the applicable Company as of the applicable date and the
results of such Company's operations and changes in cash flow for the period
then ended; provided, however, that such Financial Statements do not reflect the
ownership by KARK-TV and/or UBC of any shares of John Hancock Financial
Services, Inc. which any of such entities may own.

     2.6  Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on Schedule
2.6, the Companies have no obligation or liability (whether known or unknown,
accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to
become due and regardless of when asserted), other than (i) liabilities set
forth on the liabilities side of the Latest Balance Sheets or the notes thereto,
(ii) liabilities and obligations which have arisen after the date of the Latest
Balance Sheets in the Ordinary Course (none of which is a material liability
resulting from breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, infringement,
claim, lawsuit, violation of law or environmental liability or clean-up
obligation), or (iii) obligations of the Companies pursuant to Excludable
Contracts and the agreements set forth on Schedule 2.11(a).

     2.7  Certain Developments. During the period beginning on the day after the
date of the Latest Balance Sheets and ending on the date of this Agreement,
there has not been any Material Adverse Effect, and the Companies have conducted
their business in the Ordinary Course. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during such period, none of the Companies has:

          (a)  suffered any theft, damage, destruction or casualty loss to any
material property or assets owned or used by it or any substantial destruction
of its books and records (in each case whether or not covered by insurance);

          (b)  sold, leased, assigned or transferred any of its material assets,
tangible or intangible (other than dispositions prior to the date of this
Agreement, of obsolete or worn-out assets disposed of and replaced with assets
of equal or greater value and utility if the assets disposed of were required
for the operations of the Stations and the assignment of the Pre-TBA Receivables
pursuant to Section 1.4);

          (c)  declared or made any payment or distribution of cash or other
property to its stockholders with respect to its Equity Securities or purchased
or redeemed any shares of its Equity Securities (including any warrants, options
or other rights to acquire its Equity Securities);

          (d)  suffered any material extraordinary loss or waived any rights of
material value, whether or not in the Ordinary Course;

          (e)  entered into any other material transaction other than in the
Ordinary Course, or materially changed any material business practice;

                                        6

<PAGE>

          (f)  made or granted any bonus or any wage, salary or compensation
increase in excess of $5,000 per year to any employee or independent contractor,
except pursuant to the express terms of any Contract which is described on the
attached Schedule 2.11(a);

          (g)  made any Tax election, adopted or changed any accounting method
for Tax purposes, filed any amended Tax Return, consented to or entered into any
closing agreement or similar agreement with any Taxing Authority, consented to
or settled or compromised on any Tax Claim or assessment, or, taken any position
inconsistent with any past practice on any Tax Return; or

          (h)  agreed or committed to do any of the foregoing.

     2.8  Real Property.

          (a)  Schedule 2.8 sets forth a list of all real property owned by any
Company (the "Owned Real Property"). With respect to each such parcel of Owned
Real Property and the KARK Tower: (a) such parcel is free and clear of all
Liens, except Permitted Liens; (b) except as set forth in Schedule 2.8, there
are no leases, subleases, licenses, concessions, or other Contracts granting to
any Person the right of use or occupancy of any portion of such parcel; and (c)
there are no rights of first refusal to purchase such parcel, or any portion
thereof or interest therein.

          (b)  Schedule 2.8 sets forth a list of all leases, subleases, licenses
and other occupancy agreements, including all amendments, extensions and other
modifications (the "Leases") for real property (the "Leased Real Property") to
which any Company is a party. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Companies
have delivered to the Buyer true and complete copies of all the Leases. The
Companies have a good and valid leasehold interest in and to all of the Leased
Real Property, subject to no Liens except Permitted Liens. Each Lease is in full
force and effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms. There exists
no default or condition on the part of a Company, which, with the giving of
notice, the passage of time or both, could reasonably be expected to become a
material default of such Company under any Lease or permit the modification or
acceleration of rent under such Lease. To the best of Seller's knowledge, there
exists no default or condition on the part of any party to a Lease other than a
Company which, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to become a material default of such party under any
Lease. No Company has assigned or subleased any Leased Real Property or interest
therein. To the Seller's Knowledge, there are no outstanding options or rights
of first refusal with respect to the purchase or use of any of the Leased Real
Property, any portion thereof or interest therein. No Company is obligated to
purchase or lease any real property other than per the Leases.

          (c)  The Leased Real Property, together with the Owned Real Property
and the KARK Tower, constitutes all of the real property leased, occupied or
otherwise utilized in connection with the businesses of the Companies. Except as
set forth on Schedule 2.8, other than the Companies, there are no parties in
possession or parties having any current right or future right granted by any
Company to occupy any Real Property. The Real Property and all plants, buildings
and improvements included therein are in reasonably good condition and repair
and are sufficient and appropriate for the conduct of the businesses of the
Companies as

                                        7

<PAGE>

presently conducted. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.8, neither the Seller nor
any Company has received written notice from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person regarding any violation of Legal Requirement that now exists with
respect to any Real Property. To Seller's Knowledge, there now exists no
violation by any Company or by any other Person of any Legal Requirement with
respect to any Real Property, except as set forth on Schedule 2.8. There exists
no violation by the Seller or any Company of any material covenant, condition,
restriction, easement, agreement or order affecting any material portion of the
Real Property. All material improvements located on the Real Property have
direct access to a public road adjoining such Real Property. With respect to
Owned Real Property and the KARK Tower and to the best of Seller's knowledge
with respect to the Leased Real Property, no such improvements or accessways
encroach on land not included in the Real Property and no such improvement is
dependent for its access, operation or utility on any land, building or other
improvement not included in the Real Property. With respect to the Owned Real
Property and the KARK Tower, there is no pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge,
any threatened condemnation proceeding affecting any portion of the Real
Property. With respect to the Leased Real Property, to the best of Seller's
knowledge, there is no pending or any threatened condemnation proceeding
affecting any portion of the Real Property.

     2.9  FCC Matters.

          (a)  Generally. The attached Schedule 2.9(a) contains a complete list
of all FCC Authorizations and the dates on which such authorizations are subject
to or scheduled for renewal (in each case, a "Renewal Date"). Taken together,
the FCC Authorizations constitute all of the licenses and authorizations
required under the Communications Act and the FCC Regulations for the operation
of the Stations and the conduct of the business of the Companies as currently
conducted and as now proposed to be conducted by the Companies, and no further
FCC Authorization is necessary for the continuation of the operation of the
Stations as currently conducted or now proposed to be conducted. KARK-TV is the
holder of each FCC Authorization relating to the Station that it operates, and
Morris of Alabama is the holder of each FCC Authorization relating to the
Station that it operates. Each FCC Authorization is in full force and effect and
is not subject to or scheduled for renewal prior to the Renewal Date specified
for such FCC Authorization on the attached Schedule 2.9(a). Each FCC
Authorization is valid for the full term thereof, and Seller has no Knowledge
which would cause it to believe that any FCC Authorization will not be renewed
for a full and customary term in the ordinary course with no materially adverse
conditions (except with respect to general rule-making and similar matters
relating generally to television broadcast stations). There is not pending (or,
to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened) any action by or before the FCC to
revoke, cancel, rescind, modify, or refuse to renew in the ordinary course any
FCC Authorization, and there is not now pending, issued or outstanding (or, to
the Seller's Knowledge, threatened) by or before the FCC, any investigation,
order to show cause, cease and desist order, notice of violation, notice of
apparent liability, or notice of forfeiture, petition or complaint with respect
to the Seller, the Companies, the Stations or any FCC Authorization. The
Stations are operating in compliance in all material respects with their
respective FCC Authorizations, the Communications Act and the FCC Regulations.
The Stations are not unlawfully short-spaced, on a grandfathered basis or
otherwise, to any existing broadcast television station, outstanding
construction permit or pending application therefor, or to any existing or
proposed domestic or international TV allotment. Neither the Seller nor any of
the Companies has received any written notice to the

                                        8

<PAGE>

effect that the Seller, a Company, or a Station is causing objectionable
interference to the transmissions of any other television station or
communications facility or received any written complaints with respect thereto.
To the Seller's Knowledge, no other television station or communications
facility is causing unlawful interference with either Station's transmissions or
the public's reception of either Station's transmissions.

          (b)  Cable Matters. The attached Schedule 2.9(b) sets forth (or has
appended to it) for each Station the items described in clauses (i) through

     provided a must-carry notice or retransmission consent notice in accordance
     with the provisions of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and

     the "Cable Act Requirements"), and a list of all Market Cable Systems to
     which such Station has not provided any such must-carry or retransmission
     consent notice;

          (iii) a list of all retransmission consent and/or copyright
     indemnification agreements, if any, entered into by the Companies with

     Requirements for such notices to be effective for the 3 year period
     beginning January 1, 2003;

          (v)  a list of all Market Cable Systems, if any, which are carrying
     such Station's signal and which have given written notice of such Market
     Cable System's intention to delete such Station from carriage or to change
     such Station's channel position on such cable system, other than pursuant
     to any agreement described in clause (iii) above;

          (vi) a list of all notices, if any, received from any Market Cable
     System alleging that such Station does not deliver an adequate signal
     level, as defined in Section 76.55(c)(3) of the FCC Regulations, to such
     Market Cable System's principal headend (other than any such notice as to
     which such failure has been remedied or been determined not to exist), and
     all further correspondence with or from any such Market Cable System
     relating to such notice;

          (vii) a list of all pending petitions for special relief to include

     market, if any.

forth, for each individual now engaged by the Companies as an employee or
independent contractor with respect to the Stations, such person's name, start
date, title or position, and the annual or, as the case may be, hourly rate of
compensation (including salary, bonuses and commissions), as of the date of this
Agreement.

     2.17 Employee Benefit Plans.

          (a)  Schedule 2.17 identifies all bonus, deferred or incentive
compensation, profit sharing, retirement, vacation, sick leave, hospitalization
or severance plans, "employee benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and
material fringe benefit plans sponsored, maintained or contributed to by any
Company or with respect to which any Company has any liability, with respect to
current or former employees of the Companies (the "Plans"). No Company is a
participating or contributing employer to any Multiemployer Plan nor has any
Company incurred any withdrawal liability with respect to any Multiemployer Plan
or any liability in connection with the termination or reorganization of any
Multiemployer Plan.

          (i)  Each such Plan is in all material respects in compliance, and has
     been administered in all material respects in accordance, with the
     applicable provisions of ERISA and the Tax Code and all other applicable
     legal requirements, rules and regulations.

          (ii) All required reports and descriptions (including Form 5500 annual
     reports, summary annual reports, PBGC-1's, and summary plan descriptions)
     have been filed or distributed appropriately with respect to each such
     Plan. The requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and of
     Tax Code Section4980B have been met with respect to each such Plan that is
     an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan.

          (iii) All contributions (including all employer contributions and
     employee salary reduction contributions) that are due have been paid to
     each such Plan which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan and all
     contributions for any period ending on or before the Closing Date that are
     not yet due have been paid to each such Employee Pension Benefit Plan or
     accrued in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Companies.
     All premiums or other payments for all periods ending on or before the
     Closing Date have been paid with respect to each such Plan that is an
     Employee Welfare Benefit Plan.

          (iv) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under section 401(a)
     of the Tax Code (i) has been amended to reflect all requirements of the Tax
     Reform Act of 1986 and (ii) if required by law, has received from the
     Internal Revenue Service a favorable determination letter which considers
     the terms of the Plan as amended for such changes in law.

                                       15

<PAGE>

          (v)  The market value of assets under each such Plan that is an
     Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) equals or
     exceeds the present value of all vested and unvested liabilities thereunder
     determined in accordance with PBGC methods, factors, and assumptions
     applicable to an Employee Pension Benefit Plan terminating on the date for
     determination.

          (vi) The Companies have delivered to the Buyer prior to the date of
     this Agreement correct and complete copies of the plan documents and
     summary plan descriptions, the most recent determination letter received
     from the Internal Revenue Service, the most recent Form 5500 annual report
     as filed with the Internal Revenue Service, and all related trust
     agreements, insurance contracts, and other funding agreements that
     implement each such Plan.

          (b)  With respect to each Plan that any of the Companies, and any
Controlled Group of Corporations which includes any of the Companies, maintains
(or ever has maintained) or to which any of them contributes (or ever has
contributed or ever has been required to contribute):

          (i)  No such Plan that is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than
     any Multiemployer Plan) has been completely or partially terminated or been
     the subject of a Reportable Event as to which notices would be required to
     be filed with the PBGC. No proceeding by the PBGC to terminate any such
     Employee Pension Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) has been
     instituted or threatened.

          (ii) There have been no Prohibited Transactions with respect to any
     such Plan. No Fiduciary has any liability for breach of fiduciary duty or
     any other failure to act or comply in connection with the administration or
     investment of the assets of any such Plan. No action, suit, proceeding,
     hearing, or investigation with respect to the administration or the
     investment of the assets of any such Plan (other than routine claims for
     benefits) is pending or, to the Seller's Knowledge, threatened. The Seller
     has no Knowledge of any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding,
     hearing, or investigation.

          (iii) The Companies have not incurred, and the Seller has no reason to
     expect that any Company will incur, any liability to the PBGC (other than
     PBGC premium payments) or otherwise under Title IV of ERISA (including any
     withdrawal liability) or under the Tax Code with respect to any such Plan
     which is an Employee Pension Benefit Plan.

          (c)  The Companies do not maintain (and have not maintained since June
1, 1988, and to the Seller's Knowledge, did not maintain prior to June 1, 1988)
and do not contribute (nor have ever contributed or been required to contribute
since June 1, 1988, and to the Seller's Knowledge, prior to June 1, 1988) to any
Employee Welfare Benefit Plan providing medical, health, or life insurance or
other welfare-type benefits for current or future retired or terminated
employees, their spouses, or their dependents (other than in accordance with Tax
Code Section 4980B).

Stations immediately after the Closing Transactions without transfer,
reissuance, or other approval or action by any Governmental Entity or other
Person.

          (c)  Claims. Neither the Seller (with respect to the Stations or the

Closing, each such tangible asset will be in good operating condition and repair

     2.25 Disclosure. With respect to the Seller, the Companies and the
Stations, neither this Agreement, nor any of the schedules or exhibits hereto,
to Seller's Knowledge, contains any untrue statement of a material fact or, when
considered as a whole with respect to the business, operations, financial
condition, and results of operations of the Companies and the Stations taken as
a whole, omits a material fact necessary to make the statements contained herein

investigations pending (or, to the Buyer's knowledge, threatened) against or

the Stock, and the Buyer is not aware on the date of this Agreement of any
waiver of the FCC Regulations that will be required in order for the FCC
Consents to be granted.

at reasonable times from the Commencement Date through the Closing, the Seller
and the Companies will provide to representatives of the Buyer and its
subsidiaries and their respective financing parties and each of their respective
agents, employees and accounting, tax, legal and other advisors (collectively,
the "Investigating Parties") the following, in each case so long as such access
does not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of the
Companies:

          (i)  access to the property and assets of the Companies;

          (ii) access to all accounts, the insurance policies, Tax Returns (but
     not the consolidated federal Tax Return of Morris Multimedia, Inc. and its

     Stations, Companies and their business and operations and such other
     relevant information and materials as may be reasonably requested
     (including the ability to make copies and abstracts thereof); and

     the Companies with those directors (or equivalent officials), senior
     management employees, key sales representatives and present and former
     independent accountants of the Companies who would reasonably be presumed
     to have information that would be relevant for the purposes set forth
     above.

          (b)  Without limiting Section 4.3(a) prior to the Closing the Seller
and the Companies will (i) give the Investigating Parties such access to such
books and records pertaining to the Seller and the Companies as may reasonably
be required in order to perform any audit or other review and any disclosure
that they may deem appropriate in connection with any offering of securities by
the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof, and the Seller and the Companies (to the
extent such consent is necessary) hereby consent to the use of information
contained in such books and records for any such purpose, and (ii) use
reasonable efforts to assist the Investigating Parties in the conduct of such
audit or other review; provided, however, that Seller and the Companies must
approve in advance in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)
the disclosure of any information which Seller or a Company considers to be
confidential, proprietary or a trade secret.

     4.4  Consents Generally. Except as set forth in the immediately succeeding
paragraph, the Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith
(without being required to make any payment not specifically required by the
terms of any related Contract or Legal Requirement or agree to any material
modification or waiver of any term of any Contract or any other right) to (a)
obtain or cause to be obtained prior to the Closing Date all Consents except the
Network Affiliation Consents, and (b) cause each such Consent to be effective as
of the Closing Date (whether it is granted or entered into prior to or after the
Closing), and the Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts not to
interfere with such efforts and to facilitate Seller's obtaining such consents.

          The Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith
(without being required to make any payment not specifically required by the
terms of any related Contract or Legal Requirement or agree to any material
modification or waiver of any term of any Contract or any

                                       23

<PAGE>

other right) to obtain prior to the Commencement Date any Consents relating to
the Network Affiliation Agreements (the "Network Affiliation Consents").

     4.5  Debt Repayment. At the Closing, the Seller will repay or satisfy all
Indebtedness of the Companies. In connection with the repayment described above,
the Seller will obtain a release of any Liens with respect to Indebtedness
against the Stock or any of the property or assets of the Companies. The Seller
will cause the Companies to duly file releases or terminations of such Liens in
each governmental agency or office in which any such Lien or evidence thereof
shall have been previously filed.

     4.6  Application(s) for FCC Consent. Prior to the 10th Business Day after
the date hereof, each of the Seller and the Buyer will (and/or cause its
appropriate Affiliate(s) to) complete its portion of the application(s) to the
FCC for the FCC Consents and, together with the other Persons who are required
to join in such filings, file such application(s) with the FCC. The Seller and
Buyers shall each pay one-half of all applicable FCC application filing fees.
Each Party will diligently take or cooperate in the taking of all reasonable
steps that are necessary, proper or desirable to expedite the preparation and
filing of such application(s) and their prosecution to Final Orders and to
obtain any extension of the effectiveness of any FCC Consent that may be
required in order to permit the purchase and sale of the Stock to be consummated
pursuant to this Agreement. The Seller will provide the Buyer and the Buyer will
provide the Seller with a copy of any pleading, order or other document served
on such Person or any of its Affiliates relating to any such application(s),
unless such pleading, order or other document indicates on its face that it was
served upon or delivered to the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, or any
of its Affiliates. No Party will, and each Party will use its best efforts not
to cause or permit any of its officers, directors, partners or other Affiliates
to, take any action that could reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the likelihood of the grant of any FCC Consent or any FCC
Consent becoming a Final Order.

     4.7  Further Assurances.

          (a)  Efforts to Close. Each Party will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions to the Buyer's and the Seller's respective
obligations to consummate the Closing Transactions to be satisfied (including
the preparation, execution and delivery of all agreements and instruments
contemplated hereunder to be executed and delivered by such Party in connection
with or prior to the Closing).

          (b)  Notice of Breach. Promptly after the Buyer or any of its
officers, directors or management employees obtains knowledge thereof, but in
all events prior to the Closing, the Buyer will inform the Seller of any fact or
circumstance which, if it existed on the Closing Date, would constitute a
material breach of any representation or warranty of the Buyer set forth in this
Agreement or any material breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer or either
Broker set forth in this Agreement, or any threatened or instituted proceeding
of a type described in Section 5.1(c) or Section 5.2(d). Promptly after the
Seller obtains Knowledge thereof, but in all events prior to the Closing, the
Seller will inform the Buyer of any fact or circumstance which, if it existed on
the Commencement Date or the Closing Date, would constitute a material breach of
any representation or warranty made by the Seller on that date as set forth in
this

                                       24

<PAGE>

Agreement or any material breach of any covenant or agreement of the Seller or
any Company set forth in this Agreement, or any threatened or instituted
proceeding of a type described in Section 5.1(c) or Section 5.2(d). No such
knowledge or notice will affect any Party's right to indemnification or other
remedy provided for in this Agreement in respect of any such matter of which it
obtains knowledge or receives such notice.

          (c)  Notice of Certain Other Events. Without limiting Section 4.7(b),
at all times prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will give prompt written
notice to the Buyer (i) if any material portion of the property or assets of any
Company suffers damage on account of fire, explosion, or other cause of any
nature that is sufficient to prevent or materially affect the business or
operation of either Station or any Company in any material respect, (ii) if the
regular broadcast transmission of either Station in the normal and usual manner
in which it heretofore has been operating is interrupted or interfered with in
any material manner, (iii) if the Seller or any Company receives a National
Labor Relations Board union election petition relating to employees of any
Company, (iv) if any Company receives notice from any Market Cable System
carrying either Station's signal of such Market Cable System's intention to
delete either Station from carriage or change either Station's channel position
on such Market Cable System, or (v) any party thereto takes any action or makes
any request (or gives any notice to the effect that it intends to take any
action or make any request) with respect to the cancellation, amendment,
termination or other modification of any Network Affiliation Agreement.

          (d)  KARK Tower. The Seller and the Companies shall use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to transfer good title to the KARK Tower
from the Seller to KARK-TV free from all Liens except Permitted Liens.

     4.8  Real Estate Matters.

          (a)  Title Insurance. Prior to the Closing, the Seller will obtain for
the benefit of the Buyer and the Companies from and after the Closing, all
documents reasonably required (including estoppel certificates, owner's
affidavits, indemnities and GAP undertakings) for a final commitment for an ALTA
Owners Policy of Title Insurance, as the case may be, Form B-1970, for each
parcel of Real Property, issued by a title insurer designated by the Buyer (the
"Title Insurer"), in such amount as the Buyer reasonably determines to be the
fair market value thereof (including all Improvements thereon), insuring the
Companies' interest in such parcel, subject only to the Permitted Liens, and
with such other endorsements and other terms and conditions as the Buyer may
reasonably request.

          (b)  Surveys. The Seller will provide all documentation and use all
commercially reasonable efforts necessary to procure for the benefit of the
Buyer and the Companies from and after the Closing, in preparation for the
Closing, current surveys of each parcel of Real Property disclosing no survey
defects or encroachments which materially interfere with the current business
and operation of the Stations or the Companies, prepared by a licensed surveyor
and conforming to 1992 ALTA/ACSM Minimum Detail Requirements for Urban Land
Title Surveys, and such standards as the Title Insurer may reasonably require as
a condition to the removal of any survey exceptions from the commitment for the
title insurance policy described in Section 4.8(a), and certified to the Buyer,
the Companies, the Buyer's lenders and the Title Insurer, in a form sufficient
to permit the issuance of the title policies described above in Section 4.8(a).
The Buyer shall bear the cost of obtaining such surveys.

required to be filed with or provided to the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer
and the Seller will each pay one-half of the filing fees associated with any
such filing. Each Party will promptly supply any additional information which
may be required or requested by the FTC or the DOJ. Each Party will take all
such actions and will file and use reasonable efforts to have declared effective
or approved, all documents and notifications with any governmental or regulatory
bodies, as may be necessary or may reasonably be requested under federal
antitrust legal requirements for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

     4.11 No Premature Assumption of Control. Nothing contained in this
Agreement or the TBAs will give the Buyer or either Broker any right to control
the programming or operations of the Stations prior to the Closing Date, and the

operations of the Stations through the Closing Date.

     6.1  Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

          (a)  at any time, by mutual written agreement of the Seller and the
Buyer;

          (b)  by either Buyer or Seller by written notice to the other, after
the denial of any FCC Consent becomes final and non-appealable;

          (c)  at any time by Seller by written notice to Buyer, if

          (i)  Buyer voluntarily dissolves, liquidates or terminates operations

delivery of documents by the

                                       29

<PAGE>

     Parties prior to the Closing) or waived in writing on such date and the

          (ii) by the Buyer, by written notice to the Seller, if each condition
     set forth in Section 5.2 has been satisfied (or will be satisfied by the

          (e)  on or after the Termination Date, if the Closing has not occurred

          (i)  by the Buyer, by written notice to the Seller,

               (A)  at any time when a Seller Party, but no Buyer Party, is in
          breach of this Agreement or a TBA in any material respect ("Material
          Breach");

               (B)  at any time when both a Buyer Party and a Seller Party are
          in Material Breach; or

               (C)  at any time when no Seller Party and no Buyer Party is in
          Material Breach; or

          (ii) by the Seller, by written notice to the Buyer,

               (A)  at any time when neither no Buyer Party and no Seller Party
          is in Material Breach;

               (B)  at any time when both a Buyer Party and a Seller Party are
          in Material Breach; or

               (C)  at any time when a Buyer Party, but no Seller Party, is in
          Material Breach.

          (f)  upon termination of a TBA in accordance with the terms thereof.

          (i)  by the Buyer, by written notice to the Seller, in the event such
     termination was as a result of a breach thereof by Seller; or

                                       30

<PAGE>

          (ii) by the Seller, by written notice to the Buyer, in the event such
     termination was as a result of a breach thereof by Buyer.

          (g) on or after the 28th day following the date hereof but prior to
the Commencement Date, by the Buyer or the Seller (to the extent such party is
not in breach of Section 4.4 hereof), by written notice to the other, if the
Network Affiliation Consents have not been obtained or are not in full force and
effect.

          (h) prior to the third Business Day following the later of (i) the
30th calendar day after the date hereof, and (ii) the date upon which all
Consents required under the HSR Act have been obtained, but in no event later
than the day immediately preceding the Commencement Date, the Buyer may
terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Seller if, in its sole
discretion, it is unsatisfied with the results of its due diligence review and
other actions described in Section 1.2(d) or the parties have failed to finalize
the Schedules to this Agreement.

          (i) prior to the third Business Day following the later of (i) the
30th calendar day after the date hereof, and (ii) the date upon which all
Consents required under the HSR Act have been obtained, but in no event later
than the day immediately preceding the Commencement Date, the Seller may
terminate this Agreement by written notice to the Buyer if, in its sole
discretion, it is unsatisfied with the terms upon which its lenders are willing
to permit Seller to enter into this Agreement and/or a TBA.

The "Termination Date" will be the earlier of (1) the date upon which the
denial of any FCC Consent becomes a Final Order, or (2) the day after the seven
month anniversary of the Commencement Date. The Buyer may not rely on the
failure of any condition precedent set forth in Section 5.1 to be satisfied if
such failure was caused either by the Buyer's or either Broker's failure to act
in good faith or by a breach of or failure by the Buyer or either Broker to
perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants or other obligations
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or a TBA, and the Seller may not
rely on the failure of any condition precedent set forth in Section 5.2 to be
satisfied if such failure was caused either by the Seller's or any Company's
failure to act in good faith or by a breach of or failure by the Seller or any
of the Companies to perform any of their representations, warranties, covenants
or other obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or a TBA.

     6.2  Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as provided in
Section 6.1, then (i) this Agreement will forthwith become void as of the date
of termination and there will be no liability on the part of any Party to any
other Party or any other Person in respect thereof, and (ii) unless the
Agreement is terminated prior to the Commencement Date, Seller shall pay to
Buyer the Deposit, Seller shall pay (the "Cost of Capital Payment") to Buyer an
amount equal to the Cost of Capital Payment Amount, and the Brokers shall pay
(the "Free Cash Flow Payment") to Seller an amount equal to the Free Cash Flow,
in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds within five (5)
Business Days of such termination; provided, however, that:

          (a)  if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(ii), 6.1(d)(iii), 6.1(e)(i)(A), or 6.1(f)(i), then, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Brokers shall not be required to make the Free Cash Flow Payment.

                                       31

<PAGE>

          (b)  if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii), then Seller shall be
entitled to retain the Deposit, and, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
shall not be required to make the Cost of Capital Payment, and the Brokers shall
not be required to make the Free Cash Flow Payment.

          (c)  the obligations of the Parties described in Sections 1.4(b), 7.2
and 7.4(c) and Articles IX and X will survive any such termination; and

          (d)  no such termination will relieve any Party from liability for any
misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination; provided,
further, that the Seller Parties' sole and exclusive remedy in respect of any
breach of this Agreement or either TBA by the Buyer or either Broker prior to
any such termination shall be the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii) and to retain the
Deposit, as described in clause (b) above and clause (e) below.

          (e)  In the event of a valid termination of the Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii), the Seller shall be
entitled upon such termination to retain the Deposit as liquidated damages under
this Agreement and not as a penalty, and the retention of such amount shall be
the Seller's sole remedy at law or in equity for the Buyer's and/or a Broker's
breach hereunder and in respect of termination of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii) and the Seller is not
entitled to be retain the entire Deposit as liquidated damages for any reason
whatsoever, whether due to a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition filed
by or against Buyer or a Broker, due to a court determining that the Deposit is
a penalty rather than liquidated damages, or due to any other reason whatsoever,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller may
pursue any other remedies which Seller may have at law or in equity, including
but not limited to specific performance of this Agreement in which case Seller
may retain the Deposit to apply towards the Purchase Price at Closing. If the
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv),
6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii), Buyer and each Broker, for itself and its
respective successors, assigns, and legal representatives (including but not
limited to any trustees in bankruptcy or receivers), do hereby irrevocably
acknowledge and agree that the Seller's retention of the Deposit as liquidated
damages is not an unenforceable or unlawful penalty and is reasonable in light
of the anticipated harm which would be caused by the Buyer's and/or a Broker's
breach of this Agreement, the difficulty of proof of loss, the inconvenience and
nonfeasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the
transactions to be consummated hereunder, and further do hereby irrevocably
waive, give up and release any right to assert that the Deposit cannot be
retained by Seller as liquidated damages and agree that any such claim or
defense shall not be asserted at any time on any basis.

It is further agreed that if the Agreement is validly terminated pursuant
to Sections 6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii) and Seller is
not entitled to be paid the entire Deposit as liquidated damages because it is
determined that, for any reason, such amount is too high, then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller, at its election (but not at
the election of Buyer or a Broker), may request a court of competent
jurisdiction to judicially modify downward the amount to be paid as liquidated
damages to the highest amount which may be paid

                                       32

<PAGE>

under applicable law, and, upon learning such modified amount, Seller, at
its election, may elect to be paid such amount as liquidated damages by Buyer
and the Brokers, jointly and severally, or may elect not to be paid such amount
as liquidated damages and pursue any other remedies which Seller may have at law
or in equity, including but not limited to specific performance of this
Agreement in which case Seller may retain the Deposit to apply towards the
Purchase Price at Closing. If the Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Sections 6.1(d)(i), 6.1(d)(iv), 6.1(e)(ii)(C), or 6.1(f)(ii), Buyer and each
Broker, for itself and its respective successors, assigns, and legal
representatives (including but not limited to any trustees in bankruptcy or
receivers), do hereby irrevocably agree and consent to such judicial
modification at Seller's election and further do hereby irrevocably waive, give
up and release any right to assert that such judicial modification may not be
made.

     7.1  The Retention of Retained Records; Continuing Assistance. Subject to
their respective obligations under Section 7.4, after the Closing, the Buyer and

subsidiaries and their respective counsel, accountants and other
representatives, with reasonable access during normal business hours to the
books, records, property, personnel, contracts, commitments and documents
relating to the Companies or the Stations in their possession pertaining to

such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of
the Companies or the Stations or the Person providing such access. At the
request and expense of the requesting Person, the requested Person will deliver
copies of any such books and records to the requesting Person. After the
Closing, the Buyer and the Companies will not destroy or otherwise dispose of

not less than twenty (20) Business Days' prior written notice of such intended
destruction or disposal specifying in reasonable detail the books and records
proposed to be destroyed or disposed of, and the Seller will not destroy or
otherwise dispose of any such books and records in its possession unless the
Seller gives the Buyer not less than twenty (20) Business Days' prior written
notice of such intended destruction or disposal specifying in reasonable detail
the books and records proposed to be destroyed or disposed of; provided that,
prior to such destruction or disposal, the Party to whom such notice is given
may request that the books and records proposed to be destroyed of disposed of
instead be delivered to such Party, at such Party's expense, in any manner that
such Party may reasonably indicate by notice within such twenty (20) Business
Day period to the party proposing to make such destruction or disposal, in which
case the Party proposing to make such destruction or disposal will instead so
deliver such books and records.

     7.2  Press Releases and Announcements. Except for any public disclosure
that a Party in good faith believes is required by any Legal Requirement (in
which case, if practicable, the disclosing Party will give the other Parties an
opportunity to review and comment upon such disclosure before it is made), no
Party will make any press release or other public announcement of or with
respect to any Transaction Document or any Closing Transaction without the prior
written consent of the Buyer (in the case of any such action by a Company prior
to the Closing or

                                       33

Parties shall be permitted to disclose details with respect to the Transaction
Documents and the Closing Transactions (i) to its financing sources, and (ii) in
conjunction to the offering of securities by the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
or any filing made by the Buyer or its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity.

     7.3  Further Transfers. Each Party will execute and deliver such further
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional actions as any
other Party may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence
the transfer to the Buyer of the Stock and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

     7.4  Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.

          (a)  Non-Solicitation. In consideration of the Buyer's entry into this
Agreement and the payment of the Purchase Price at Closing, during the period
beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the second anniversary of
the Closing Date, neither the Seller nor any Affiliate of the Seller or
stockholder of the Seller or any such Affiliate will directly or indirectly,
contact, approach or solicit for the purpose of offering employment to or hiring
(whether as an employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise)
or actually hire any person who is employed in the operation of the Companies or
the Stations on the date hereof or on the Commencement Date, or induce or
attempt to induce any customer or other business relation of the Companies or
the Stations into any business relationship that might materially harm the
Buyer, the Companies or the Stations. In consideration of and as inducement for
the Seller's entry into this Agreement, during the period beginning on the date
of this Agreement and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing Date,
neither the Buyer nor any Affiliate of the Buyer or stockholder of the Buyer or
any such Affiliate will directly or indirectly, contact, approach or solicit for
the purpose of offering employment to or hiring (whether as an employee,
consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise) or actually hire any
person who is employed in the operation of Morris Multimedia, Inc. or any of its
Affiliates on the date hereof or on the Commencement Date (other than employees
of any Company). If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Section 7.4(a) is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the
intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Section
7.4(a) will be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time
within which the judgment may be appealed.

          (b)  Confidentiality by the Seller. The Seller and its Affiliates and
each stockholder of the Seller or any of its Affiliates will treat and hold as
confidential all information concerning the business and affairs of the
Companies or the Stations which is of a type that in accordance with the
Seller's or the Companies' past practices has been treated as confidential or
proprietary ("Confidential Information"), refrain from using any Confidential
Information except in connection with this Agreement and the TBAs, and after the
Closing, at the request and option of the Buyer, deliver promptly to the Buyer
or destroy, all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of Confidential
Information which are in their possession or under their control; provided that
the Seller shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information to its
financing sources and as

                                       34

<PAGE>

required to be disclosed in conjunction to the offering of securities by
the Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any filing made by the Seller or its
Affiliates with any Governmental Entity. If the Seller or any of its Affiliates
or any stockholder of the Seller or any of its Affiliates is requested or
required (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar
process) to disclose any Confidential Information, then it or he will notify the
Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that the Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 7.4(b). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, the Seller or any of its Affiliates or any stockholder of the
Seller or any of its Affiliates is, on the advice of counsel, compelled to
disclose any Confidential Information in connection with any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process, then it
or he may disclose such Confidential Information in connection therewith;
provided that it or he will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at the
request and expense of the Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such portion of such Confidential Information as
the Buyer may designate.

          (c)  Confidentiality by the Buyer. Buyer and its Affiliates shall
treat and hold as confidential all information concerning the business,
financial information, financial statements, and affairs of Morris Multimedia,
Inc. and its Affiliates other than the Companies, it being agreed that all such
information is confidential; provided that the Buyer shall be permitted to
disclose information to its financing sources and as required to be disclosed in
conjunction to the offering of securities by the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
or any filing made by the Buyer or its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall refrain from using any of such confidential
information except as contemplated by this Agreement or the TBAs and shall
refrain from disclosing such confidential information to any person or entity
other than Buyer's accountants, attorneys, and similar advisors for purposes of
entering into and consummating this Agreement or the TBAs and the transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby. After any termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 6.1, Buyer and its Affiliates, at the request of the Seller, deliver
promptly to the Seller or destroy all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of
any such confidential information which are in their possession or under their
control and shall take all reasonable acts necessary to cause its said advisors
to do the same. Any of said advisors to whom Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer
discloses any of such confidential information pursuant to this paragraph shall
first be made aware of the covenants contained in this paragraph.

          Prior to the Closing and after the termination of this Agreement
should the Closing not occur, the Buyer and its Affiliates will treat and hold
as confidential all information concerning the business and affairs of the
Companies or the Stations that to the Buyer's knowledge is Confidential
Information, refrain from using or disclosing any such Confidential Information
except as contemplated by this Agreement or the TBAs, and, after any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1, at the request of the Seller, deliver
promptly to the Seller or destroy all tangible embodiments (and all copies) of
any such Confidential Information which are in their possession or under their
control; provided that the Buyer shall be permitted to disclose Confidential
Information to its financing sources and as required to be disclosed in
conjunction to the offering of securities by the Buyer or any Affiliate thereof
or any filing made by the Buyer or its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity.
If the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is requested or required prior to the
Closing (by oral question or request for information or documents in any legal
proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or

                                       35

<PAGE>

similar process) to disclose any such Confidential Information, then it
will notify the Seller promptly of the request or requirement so that the Seller
may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions
of this Section 7.4(c). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt
of a waiver hereunder, the Buyer or any of its Affiliates is, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information in connection
with any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand,
or similar process, then it may disclose such Confidential Information in
connection therewith; provided that it will use its best efforts to obtain, at
the request and expense of the Seller, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of such Confidential
Information as the Seller may designate.

          (d)  Remedy for the Seller's or Stockholder's Breach. Any action or
omission by an Affiliate of the Seller, or a stockholder of the Seller or an
Affiliate of the Seller, that is not a Party and that would constitute a breach
of this Section 7.4 if such Person were a party to this Agreement will
constitute a breach of this Section 7.4 by the Seller, and each Seller Party
will cause each such Affiliate or stockholder to comply with the provisions of
this Section 7.4. The Seller and each Company acknowledges and agrees that in
the event of a breach by it or any such other Person of any of the provisions of
this Section 7.4, monetary damages may be inadequate and the Buyer and its
Affiliates may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any
such breach, the Buyer and its Affiliates may, in addition to any other rights
and remedies existing in their favor, enforce their rights and the Seller's and
each Company's obligations hereunder by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other relief, without any requirement of posting
a bond or proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security.

          (e)  Remedy for the Buyer's Breach. Any action or omission by an
Affiliate of the Buyer that is not a Party and that would constitute a breach of
this Section 7.4 if such Person were a party to this Agreement will constitute a
breach of this Section 7.4 by the Buyer, and each Buyer Party will cause each
such Affiliate to comply with the provisions of this Section 7.4. The Buyer and
each Broker acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach by it or any
such Affiliate of any of the provisions of this Section 7.4, monetary damages
may be inadequate and the Seller and its Affiliates may have no adequate remedy
at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach, the Seller and its
Affiliates may, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their
favor, enforce their rights and the Buyer's and each Broker's obligations
hereunder by an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or
other relief, without any requirement of posting a bond or proving actual
damages or posting any bond or other security.

     7.5  Certain Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Buyer and the Seller for certain tax
matters following the Closing Date:

          (a)  Tax Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify each of the
Companies, the Buyer, and each Buyer Affiliate and hold them harmless from and
against, without duplication, any loss, claim, liability, expense, or other
damage attributable to (i) all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of any of the
Companies and their Subsidiaries for all Taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any

                                       36

<PAGE>

Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which any of the Companies and their
Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a member on
or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Section 1.1502-6 of the
Treasury regulations or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law
or regulation, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any person (other than any of the
Companies) imposed on any of the Companies as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing. The Seller shall reimburse
the Buyer for any Taxes of any of the Companies which are the responsibility of
the Seller pursuant to this Section 7.5 within ten (10) business days before
payment of such Taxes by the Buyer or any of the Companies.

The indemnities of the Seller contained in this Section 7.5 shall not be
subject to the limitations contained in Article IX.

          (b)  Allocation of Certain Taxes.

          (i)  If any of the Companies is permitted but not required under
     applicable state, local or non-U.S. income tax laws to treat the Closing
     Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the parties shall cause the
     Companies, as applicable, to treat that day as the last day of a taxable
     period.

          (ii) In the case of Taxes arising in a taxable period of any of the
     Companies that includes but does not end on the Closing Date, except as
     provided in Section 7.5(b)(iii), the allocation of such Taxes between the
     Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period shall be made on the
     basis of an interim closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.
     For the sake of clarity, for purposes of this Section 7.5, any Tax
     resulting from the departure of any Company from the Seller's Affiliated
     Group (resulting from the triggering into income of deferred intercompany
     transactions under Section 1.1502-13 of the Treasury regulations or excess
     loss accounts under Section 1.1502-19 of the Treasury regulations or
     otherwise) is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

          (iii) In the case of (i) franchise Taxes based on capitalization, debt
     or shares of stock authorized, issued or outstanding, and (ii) ad valorem
     Taxes, in either case attributable to any taxable period that includes but
     does not end on the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes attributable to
     the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
     taxable period, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
     number of calendar days in such taxable period ending on and including the
     Closing Date and the denominator of which is the entire number of calendar
     days in such taxable period; provided, however, that if any property, asset
     or other right of any of the Companies is sold or otherwise transferred on
     or prior to the Closing Date, then ad valorem Taxes pertaining to such
     property, asset or other right shall be attributed entirely to the
     Pre-Closing Tax Period.

          (c)  Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns. The Seller shall include
the income of the Companies on the Seller's consolidated U.S. federal income Tax
Returns for all

                                       37

<PAGE>

periods through the Closing Date and pay any federal income Taxes
attributable to such income. For all taxable periods ending on or before the
Closing Date, the Seller shall cause the Companies to join in the Seller's
consolidated federal income tax return and, in jurisdictions requiring separate
reporting from the Seller, to file separate company state and local income tax
returns. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent
with prior practice, except as required by a change in applicable law. The Buyer
shall cause the Companies to furnish information to the Seller as reasonably
requested by the Seller to allow the Seller to satisfy its obligations under
this section in accordance with past custom and practice. The Companies and the
Buyer shall consult and cooperate with the Seller as to any elections to be made
on returns of the Companies for periods ending on or before the Closing Date.
The Buyer shall cause the Companies to file income Tax Returns or shall include
the Companies in its or an Affiliate's combined or consolidated income tax
returns, for all periods other than periods ending on or before the Closing
Date.

          (d)  Cooperation on Tax Matters.

          (i)  The Buyer, the Companies, and the Seller shall cooperate fully,
     as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection
     with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.5 and any audit,
     litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
     shall include the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the
     provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
     such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available
     on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
     explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Companies and the
     Seller agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax
     matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any taxable period beginning
     before the Closing Date until one-hundred eighty (180) days after the
     expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent
     notified by the Buyer or the Seller, any extensions thereof) of the
     respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
     entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (B) to give the other Party
     reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding
     any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests, the
     Companies or the Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to
     take possession of such books and records.

          (ii) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to use
     their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
     governmental authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
     reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not
     limited to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

          (iii) The Buyer and the Seller further agree, upon request, to provide
     the other party with all information that either party may be required to
     report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Tax Code and all Treasury
     regulations promulgated thereunder.

          (e)  Tax Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Companies shall be terminated as of
the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Companies shall not be bound
thereby or have any liability thereunder.

                                       38

<PAGE>

          (f)  Certain Taxes and Fees. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by the Seller when due, and the Seller will, at
their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges, and, if required by applicable law,
the Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns and other documentation.

          (g)  Audits. Unless Article IX (including Section 9.3) provides
otherwise, (i) the Seller shall allow any of the Companies and its counsel to
participate at such Company's expense in any audit of the Seller's consolidated
federal income Tax Returns to the extent that such returns relate to any of the
Companies, and (ii) the Seller shall not settle any such audit in a manner which
would adversely affect the Companies after the Closing Date unless such
settlement would be reasonable in the case of a Person that owned the Companies
both before and after the Closing Date.

          (h)  Carrybacks. The Seller shall immediately pay to the Buyer any Tax
refund (or reduction in Tax liability) resulting from a carryback of a
post-acquisition Tax attribute of any of the Companies into the Seller's
consolidated Tax Return, when such refund (or reduction) is realized by the
Seller's group. At the Buyer's request, the Seller will cooperate with the
Companies in obtaining such refund (or reduction), including through the filing
of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. The Buyer agrees to indemnify the
Seller for any Taxes resulting from the disallowance of such post-acquisition
Tax attribute on audit or otherwise.

          (i)  Retention of Carryovers. The Seller shall not elect to retain any
net operating loss carryovers or capital loss carryovers of the Companies.

          (j)  Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Section 7.5 and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Section 7.5 shall control.

          (k)  Survival. All rights and obligations under this Section 7.5 shall
survive the Closing and continue indefinitely.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         AGREEMENTS REGARDING EMPLOYEES

     8.1  Station Employees. The Buyer understands, acknowledges and agrees that
as of the Closing, the employees employed by the Companies as of the Closing
Date (the "Station Employees"), shall no longer be entitled to participate in
the Companies' employee benefit plans sponsored by the Seller or Morris
Multimedia, Inc., and the Buyer (or its Affiliates) shall cover the Station
Employees under its (or an Affiliate's) own employee benefit plans with no
reduction in years of credited service. If the Buyer shall terminate the
employment any of the Station Employees after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
be responsible for and shall pay any and all severance obligations and earned
and accrued vacation owed to such terminated Station Employee. The Buyer or the
Companies shall indemnify, defend and hold the Seller and its Affiliates
harmless from and against all liabilities, claims and causes of action
(including,

                                       39

<PAGE>

without limitation, reasonable attorney fees and other legal costs and
expenses) arising out of a termination of the employment of any of the Station
Employees following the Closing Date, except to the extent related to events
occurring prior to the Commencement Date. The Seller shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Buyer and the Companies and their Affiliates from and against
all liabilities, claims and causes of action (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorney fees and other legal costs and expenses) arising out of the
employment of the Station Employees prior to the Commencement Date, including
but not limited to claims arising out of alleged violations of applicable labor
or employment laws or wrongful termination.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer
and the Brokers agree that, if this Agreement terminates and the Closing does
not occur, then Buyer and the Brokers shall not, for a period of at least two
(2) years after the termination of this Agreement, directly or indirectly,
contact, approach or solicit for the purpose of offering employment to or hiring
(whether as an employee, consultant, agent, independent contractor or otherwise)
or actually hire any of the employees of the Companies as of such termination.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Buyer
and the Brokers agree that, if this Agreement terminates and the Closing does
not occur, then (a) Seller and/or the Companies shall have the right to
immediately do business with all customers and vendors of the Stations, (b)
Buyer and the Brokers shall cease to do business with the Station's customers
and vendors, (c) Buyer and the Brokers shall provide all commercially reasonable
assistance reasonably requested by the Seller and/or the Companies necessary to
facilitate the same, and (d) Buyer and the Brokers shall not, for a period of at
least two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement, directly or
indirectly, contact, approach, or solicit for the purpose of providing to or
purchasing from any such customer or vendor any goods, services, or other items
provided to or by a Station during the TBAs.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                       INDEMNIFICATION AND RELATED MATTERS

     9.1  Survival; Absence of Other Representations. All representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any
writing or certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement will survive
the Closing and the consummation of the Closing Transactions until the 18 month

for or on behalf of, or any notice to, any Party, the knowledge of any Party or
any of their respective officers, directors, stockholders, partners, employees,

                                       40

<PAGE>

representation and warranty shall survive until the final resolution of such
claim and the breach described therein. No Party has made or will make in
connection with this Agreement any representation or warranty, express or
implied, other than as set forth in this Agreement, the schedules hereto, and
the certificates delivered pursuant hereto. The rights of indemnification
hereunder and termination under Section 6.1 shall be each Party's exclusive

action, suit, proceeding, claim or judgment relating to any matter described in

or any of its Affiliates (including any Company) may suffer, sustain or become
subject to, as a result of:

          (i)  any breach by the Seller of any representation or warranty of the
     Seller set forth in this Agreement (including any representation or
     warranty deemed to be remade by the Seller as of the Commencement Time or
     the Closing pursuant to the first paragraph of Article II) or any
     certificate delivered by the Seller in connection with the Closing;

          (ii) any litigation, investigation, proceeding, or other claim by any
     Governmental Entity or any Person not claiming by, through or under the
     Buyer, to the extent that the same actually arises from or relates to the
     business or operation of the Companies, the Stations or any assets or
     property thereof prior to the Commencement Time, or of the Seller; or

          (iii) any liability or obligation of the Seller or any Company
     relating to Indebtedness;

          (iv) any breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
     Agreement or a TBA by any Company prior to the Closing or by the Seller;

limitations:

(A)  the Seller will not be liable for any Loss described in clause (i) above
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses described in clause (i)
above exceeds $750,000 (the "Seller Threshold Amount"), in which event the

(B)  the Seller will not be liable for any Loss described in clause (i) above to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all Losses described in clause (i) above
exceeds $20,000,000.

          (b)  By the Buyer. After the Commencement Time, the Buyer will
indemnify the Seller and hold the Seller harmless from and against any Loss
which the Seller may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as the result of:

          (i)  any breach by the Buyer of any representation or warranty of the
     Buyer set forth in this Agreement (including any representation or warranty
     deemed to be remade by the Buyer as of the Closing pursuant to the first
     paragraph of Article IV) or any certificate delivered by the Buyer in
     connection with the Closing;

          (ii) any litigation, investigation, proceeding, or other claim by any
     Governmental Entity or any Person not claiming by, through or under the
     Seller or any Affiliate of the Seller, to the extent that the same actually
     arises from or relates to the business or operation of the Stations after
     the Closing; or

          (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
     Agreement or a TBA by any Company after the Closing or by the Buyer or
     either Broker.

          (c)  Determination of Loss and Amount. For purposes of determining
whether any Loss has occurred, or the amount of any such Loss, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth
in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents will be considered without
regard to any materiality qualification set forth therein.

     9.3  Indemnification Procedures.

          (a)  Notice of Claim. Any Party making a claim for indemnification
under Section 9.2 (the "Indemnified Party") will notify the Party from whom
indemnification is claimed (the "Indemnifying Party") of the claim in writing
promptly after receiving written notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim against it (if by a third party) or discovering the
liability, obligation or facts giving rise to such claim for indemnification.
Such notice will describe the claim, the amount thereof (to the extent then
known and quantifiable), and the basis therefor, in each case to the extent
known to the Indemnified Party. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 9.2,
except to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying
Party.

          (b)  Assumption of Defense. With respect to any third party claim
which gives rise or is alleged to give rise to a claim for indemnity under
Section 9.2 and which involves only the payment of money damages to such third
party and which does not concern any FCC Authorization, the Indemnifying Party,
at its option (subject to the limitations set forth below), will be entitled to
control and assume responsibility for the defense of such claim and to appoint a
competent and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
to act as lead counsel of such defense. Prior to the Indemnifying Party's
assuming control of such defense, the Indemnifying Party must first furnish the
Indemnified Party with evidence which, in the Indemnified Party's reasonable
judgment, establishes that the Indemnifying Party is and will be able to satisfy
any such liability.

                                       42

<PAGE>

          (c)  Limits of Assumption of Defense. An Indemnifying Party's rights
under Section 9.3(b) will be subject to the following additional limitations:

          (i)  with respect to any claim the defense of which the Indemnifying
     Party has assumed, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in
     the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
     purpose, and the fees and expenses of such separate counsel will be borne
     by the Indemnified Party (except that the reasonable fees and expenses of
     such separate counsel incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party
     effectively assumes control of such defense will be borne by the
     Indemnifying Party);

          (ii) the Indemnifying Party will not be entitled to assume (or retain,
     as applicable) control of such defense if (A) the claim for indemnification
     relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
     indictment, allegation or investigation against the Indemnified Party, (B)
     the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes in good faith that, in light of
     any actual or potential conflict of interest, it would be inappropriate for
     legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party to represent the
     Indemnified Party, (C) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes in good
     faith that an adverse determination with respect to the action, lawsuit,
     investigation, proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim for
     indemnification would be materially detrimental to or materially injure the
     Indemnified Party's reputation or future business prospects (or, in the
     case of a claim by the Buyer, a Station's or a Company's reputation or
     business prospects), or (D) upon the Indemnifying Party failing to
     vigorously prosecute or defend such claim in good faith or failing to begin
     such prosecution or defense in a timely manner; and

          (iii) if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the defense of any
     such claim, then the Indemnifying Party will obtain the prior written
     consent of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of
     such claim, if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally
     release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with
     respect to such claim.

If the Indemnifying Party has the right to, but does not, assume control of the
defense of any claim in accordance with this Section 9.3, then the Indemnifying
Party may nonetheless participate (at its own expense) in the defense of such
claim and at the Indemnifying Party's request the Indemnified Party will consult
in a reasonable manner with the Indemnifying Party in respect of such defense.
As used in this Article IX, the term "settlement" refers to any settlement,
compromise, consent or similar decree, or election to permit default judgment to
be entered, in respect of any claim.

     9.4  Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Each Party will treat all
payments made pursuant to Section 9.2 (and Section 7.5) (not including payments
to third parties pursuant to third party claims) as adjustments of the Purchase
Price for all purposes. Each Party agrees to use reasonable efforts to seek
recovery under any insurance coverage which such Party may have in respect of
any Loss; provided that a Party's Loss will include any increased premium which
results from seeking such recovery or the occurrence or existence of any fact or
circumstance to which such Loss relates.

     10.1 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended and any provision
of this Agreement may be waived; provided that any such amendment or waiver (a)
will be binding upon a Company (prior to the Closing) or the Seller if and only

the Buyer, and (b) will be binding upon a Company (after the Closing), the Buyer
or a Broker if and only if such amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing
executed by the Buyer and the Seller. No course of dealing between or among any
Persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to
modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any rights or
obligations of any Party under or by reason of this Agreement. No failure by any
Party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty, agreement or
condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy consequent upon a
breach thereof will constitute a waiver of any such breach or any other
covenant, duty, agreement or condition.

     10.2 Notices. All notices, demands and other communications given or
delivered under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have
been given when personally delivered or delivered by express courier service.

     10.3 Binding Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective permitted successors and assigns. No Party may assign
either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder
without the prior written approval of the Buyer (in the case of an assignment by
a Company prior to the Closing or by the Seller) or the Seller (in the case of
any other assignment); provided, however, that without any such consent of the
Seller (a) prior to the Closing, the Buyer or a Broker may (i) assign any or all
of its rights and any claims under this Agreement to one or more of its
creditors, (ii) assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one
or more of its Affiliates and (iii) designate one or more of its Affiliates to
perform its obligations hereunder, and (b) any Buyer Party or Company may assign
any or all of such rights or claims to any Person after the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the case of any assignment, whether
consented to or not and regardless of whether any consent is required in any
event, the assigning Party, and each Party jointly and severally obligated under
this Agreement with the assigning Party as contemplated by Section 10.16 or
otherwise, nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all of
the assigning Party's obligations hereunder.

     10.4 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will
be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of
such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

     10.5 No Strict Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent.
In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Person by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

     10.6 Captions. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not be
deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and construed
as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

     10.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein
contain the entire agreement between the Parties and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between the Parties, written
or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way.

     10.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original but all of which taken
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

                                       45

     10.9 Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction, validity and
interpretation of this Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal legal requirements of the State of New York, without giving
effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision (whether of the State
of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
legal requirements of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. In
furtherance of the foregoing, the internal law of the State of New York will
control the interpretation and construction of this Agreement (and all schedules
and exhibits hereto), even if under that jurisdiction's choice of law or
conflict of law analysis, the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would
ordinarily apply.

     10.10 Specific Performance. The Seller and the Companies acknowledge that
the Companies and the Stations and their businesses and operations are unique,
and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by
the Seller or any Company, monetary damages may be inadequate and the Buyer and
the Brokers may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any
such breach, the Buyer, the Brokers and/or their successors or assigns may, in
addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor, enforce their
rights and the Seller's and the Companies' obligations hereunder by an action or
actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other relief, without any
requirement of proving actual damages or posting any bond or other security.

     10.11 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Parties
each will pay all of their own fees, costs and expenses (including fees, costs
and expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, accountants, brokers or other
representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses);
provided that, except as otherwise provided herein or in a TBA, the Seller will
be responsible for and pay all such fees, costs and expenses of the Companies
incurred or arising prior to the Closing. The Seller will not cause or permit
any Company to expend any amount to remedy or cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of any Seller Party set forth in
any Transaction Document but will instead undertake any such remedy or cure
solely at the Seller's expense and for the Seller's account.

     10.12 Parties in Interest. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer on any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns any rights or remedies under or by virtue of
this Agreement.

     10.13 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Where any accounting
determination or calculation is required to be made under this Agreement, such
determination or calculation (unless otherwise provided) will be made in
accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent therewith, the accounting
policies employed by the Seller and/or the Companies in the preparation of the
Latest Balance Sheets.

     10.14 Waiver of Jury Trial. AS A SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED INDUCEMENT FOR EACH
OF THE PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT (EACH PARTY HAVING HAD OPPORTUNITY
TO CONSULT COUNSEL), EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY WAIVES THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LAWSUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS AGREEMENT
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN.

     10.15 Other Definitional Provisions. The terms "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and terms of similar import will refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Section, clause, Exhibit
and Schedule references contained in this Agreement are references to Sections,
clauses, Exhibits and Schedules in or attached to this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a comparable
meaning when used in its plural or singular form. Each gender-specific term used
in this Agreement has a comparable meaning whether used in a masculine, feminine

"aware" will include the actual knowledge and awareness of the Person in
question, and the knowledge and awareness that Person would have obtained after
making reasonable inquiry and exercising reasonable diligence with respect to
the matter in question. Whenever the term "including" is used in this Agreement
(whether or not that term is followed by the phrase "but not limited to" or
"without limitation" or words of similar effect) in connection with a listing of
items within a particular classification, that listing will be interpreted to be
illustrative only and will not be interpreted as a limitation on, or an
exclusive listing of, the items within that classification.

     10.16 Guarantee. The Seller and the Companies jointly and severally
guarantee all the liabilities and obligations of each other under this Agreement
and the TBAs; provided that if the Closing occurs the Companies shall no longer
have any liability or obligation with respect to liabilities or obligations of
the Seller under this Agreement or the TBAs. The Buyer and the Brokers jointly
and severally guarantee all the liabilities and obligations of each other under
this Agreement and the TBAs. The Seller and the Companies shall have the

TBAs, including monies owed to the Buyer being set-off against monies due from
Seller or a Broker, or vice-versa and the Buyer and the Broker shall have the
complete right of set-off under this Agreement and/or either or both of the
TBAs, including monies owed to the Seller being set-off against monies due from
a Company, and vice-versa.
