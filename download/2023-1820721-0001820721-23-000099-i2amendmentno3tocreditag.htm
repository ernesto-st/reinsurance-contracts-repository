In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate.  Upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election, Section 3.02 provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest.  The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the applicable parties as and when required by Section 3.02, of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on Eurocurrency Rate Loans is based.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or otherBase Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR or Term SOFR, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition of &#8220;Eurocurrency Rate&#8221; or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any suchthereof, or any alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Section 3.02, whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, and (ii) the implementation ofthereto (including any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes pursuant to Section 3.02), including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the Eurocurrency Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate, Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability, or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes.  The Administrative Agent and its affiliates or other related entities may engage in transactions that affect the calculation of Base Rate, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR, Adjusted Term SOFR, any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement) or any relevant adjustments thereto, in each case, in a manner adverse to the Borrower, other than, in each case, to the extent of the Administrative Agent&#8217;s gross negligence, bad faith or willful -99- #96501157v12 </FONT></DIV>

(a) Each Term Borrowing, each Revolving Credit Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans shall be made upon the Borrower&#8217;s irrevocable notice, on behalf of the Borrower, to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone.  Each such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, (i) in the case of a Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loan, not later than 1:00 p.m., Local Time, three (3) Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing (or, in the case of Initial Term Loans to be borrowed on the Closing Date, one (1) Business Day before the proposed Borrowing), or (ii) in the case of a Base Rate Loan or (if applicable) Daily SOFR Loans, not later than 11:00 a.m., Local Time, on same day of the proposed Borrowing.  Each telephonic notice by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or electronic transmission to the Administrative Agent of a written Committed Loan Notice, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower.  Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans or (if applicable) Daily SOFR Loans shall, in each case, be in a principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof.  Except as provided in Section 2.03(c), each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a whole multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof.  Each Committed Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify (i) whether the Borrower are requesting a Term Borrowing, a Revolving Credit Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the Class and principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto and (vi) the location and number of the Borrower&#8217;s account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.02(b). If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or fail to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made or continued as, or converted to Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion or continuation shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fail to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one (1) month.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower and Lenders acknowledge and agree that any conversion or continuation of an existing Loan shall be deemed to be a continuation of that Loan with a converted interest rate methodology and not a new Loan. (b) Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Appropriate Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Class of Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Appropriate Lender of the details of any automatic conversion or continuation described in Section 2.02(a).

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurocurrency RateSOFR Loan unless the Borrower pay the amount due, if any, under Section 3.04 in connection therewith.

(i) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of a drawing under such Letter of Credit, the relevant L/C Issuer shall notify promptly the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof.  On the Business Day immediately following the Business Day on which the Borrower shall have received notice of any payment by an L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit (or, if the Borrower shall have received such notice later than 1:00 p.m. on any Business Day, on the second succeeding Business Day) (such date of payment, an &#8220;Honor Date&#8221;), the Borrower shall reimburse such L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in Dollars in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing using the Exchange Rate in relation to Dollars in effect on the Honor Date.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; herein and in the other Loan Documents with reference to any Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law.

In each case as specified in this Section 9.11, the Administrative Agent  will promptly (and each Lender irrevocably authorizes the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower&#8217;s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request (i) to evidence the release or subordination of such item of Collateral from the assignment and security interest granted under the Collateral Documents (including the filing of termination statements or the return of pledged collateral), or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guaranty, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.11; provided, that prior to any such request, the Borrower shall have in each case delivered to the Administrative Agent written request therefor and, to the extent requested by the Administrative Agent, a certificate of the Borrower to the effect that the release of such Guarantor or Collateral, as applicable, is in compliance with the Loan Documents.

Section 9.14 Withholding Tax.  To the extent required by any applicable Law, the Administrative Agent may deduct or withhold from any payment to any Lender under any Loan Document an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax.  If the Internal Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold Tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not properly executed or because such Lender failed to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstance that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding Tax ineffective), such Lender shall indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including any penalties, additions to Tax or interest and together with all expenses (including legal expenses, allocated internal costs and out-of-pocket expenses) incurred, whether or not such Tax was correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due the Administrative Agent under this Section 9.14.  The agreements in this Section 9.14 shall survive the resignation and/or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of this Agreement and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations.  For the avoidance of doubt, (1) the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; shall, for purposes of this Section 9.14, include any L/C Issuer and (2) this Section 9.14 shall not limit or expand the obligations of the Borrower or any Guarantor under Section 3.01 or any other provision of this Agreement. -204- #96501157v12 </FONT></DIV>

No Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of a Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant&#8217;s interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish in connection with a Tax audit that such commitment, loan, or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or, if different, under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code. (f) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower&#8217;s prior written consent or except to the extent such entitlement to a greater payment results from a Change in Law after the Participant became a Participant. (g) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other central bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto. (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a &#8220;Granting Lender&#8221;) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (an &#8220;SPC&#8221;) the option to provide all or any part of any Loan that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make pursuant to this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPC to fund any Loan and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to make all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof.  Each party hereto hereby agrees that (i) an SPC shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections 3.01, 3.03 and 3.04, subject to the requirements and limitations of such Sections (including Section 3.01(f) and (g) and Sections 3.05 and 3.06 (it being understood that the SPC shall deliver the forms described in Section 3.01(f) solely to the Granting Lender, it being understood that copies of such forms may be required to be included (and, if so, will be included) as part of a non-U.S. Lender&#8217;s IRS Form W-8IMY provided to the Administrative Agent or the Borrower)), to the same extent as if such SPC were a Lender, but neither the grant to any SPC nor the exercise by any SPC of such option shall increase the costs or expenses or otherwise increase or change the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement (including its obligations under Section 3.01, 3.03 or 3.04) except to the extent any entitlement to greater amounts results from a Change in Law after the grant to the SPC occurred, (ii) no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or similar payment obligation under this Agreement for which a -217- #96501157v12 </FONT></DIV>

If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent in such currency, the Administrative Agent agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable Law). -224- #96501157v12 </FONT></DIV>
