SECTION 2.03.     Requests for Borrowings.  To request a Revolving Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Agent of such request by
telephone (a) in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, three Business Days before the
date of the proposed Borrowing or (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 10:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the day of

                                                                18

the proposed Borrowing.  Each such telephonic Borrowing Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Agent of a written Borrowing Request in a form approved by the Agent and signed by the Borrower.  Each
such telephonic and written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:

(i)      the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;

(ii)     the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii)    whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing;

(iv)     in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period
contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period"; and

(v)      the location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the
requirements of Section 2.06.

         If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be an ABR Borrowing.  If no
Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested Eurodollar Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected
an Interest Period of one month's duration.  Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section, the
Agent shall advise each Revolving Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Revolving Lender's Loan to be made as part
of the requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.04.     Swingline Loans.

(a)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make advances to the Borrower from
time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result
in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $20,000,000 or (ii) the sum of the total Revolving
Exposures exceeding the total Revolving Commitments; provided that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline
Loan to refinance an outstanding Swingline Loan.  Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Borrower may borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.

(b)      To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Swingline Lender of such request by telephone (confirmed by
telecopy) not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan.  Each such notice shall be
irrevocable and shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan.  The
Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the Borrower by means of a credit to the general deposit account of the
Borrower with the Swingline Lender or by wire transfer, automated clearing house debit or interbank transfer to such other account,
accounts or Persons as may be designated from time to time by the Borrower (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the
reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the Issuing Bank) by 3:00 p.m., Dallas, Texas
time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.

(c)      The Swingline Lender may by written notice given to the Agent not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time, on any
Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a portion of the Swingline Loans
outstanding.  Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate.

                                                                19

Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Agent will give notice thereof to each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such
Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and
unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to pay to the Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such
Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Loans.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to acquire participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the
Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this paragraph by wire transfer of immediately available funds, in the
same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis
mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Lenders), and the Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so
received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  The Agent shall notify the Borrower of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired
pursuant to this paragraph, and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Agent and not to the
Swingline Lender.  Any amounts received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in
respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of participations therein shall be
promptly remitted to the Agent; any such amounts received by the Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Agent to the Revolving
Lenders that shall have made their payments pursuant to this paragraph and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear.
The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this paragraph shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the
payment thereof.

SECTION 2.05.     Letters of Credit.

(a)      General.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit
for its own account, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving
Availability Period.  In the event of any inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and
conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the
Borrower with, the Issuing Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.

(b)      Notice of Issuance, Amendment, Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions.  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or
the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by
electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the Issuing Bank) to the Issuing Bank and the Agent
(reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension) a notice requesting the issuance of a
Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall
comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and
such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.  If requested by the Issuing
Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the Issuing Bank's standard form in connection with any
request for a Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended only if (and upon issuance,
amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving
effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the LC Exposure shall not exceed $40,000,000 and (ii) the total
Revolving Exposures shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments.

                                                                20

(c)      Expiration Date.  Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of (i) the date
one year after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, one year
after such renewal or extension) (provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for the renewal thereof for
additional one-year periods not to extend past the date in clause (ii) below) and (ii) the date that is five Business Days prior to
the Maturity Date.

(d)      Participations.  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount
thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to
each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit
equal to such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the
Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender's Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the
Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section, or of any
reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.  Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that
its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this paragraph in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional
and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or
the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment
shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.

(e)      Reimbursement.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall
reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas,
Texas time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior
to 10:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such
date, then not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower
receives such notice; provided that the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance
with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the
extent so financed, the Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Borrowing
or Swingline Loan.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender's Applicable
Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by
such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the
Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders.  Promptly following receipt
by the Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing
Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to
such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.  Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this
paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan
as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC
Disbursement.

(f)      Obligations Absolute.  The Borrower's obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement

                                                                21

under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or
this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be
forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by
the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of
such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that
might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against,
the Borrower's obligations hereunder.  The Agent, the Lenders, the Issuing Bank, or any of their Related Parties, shall not have any
liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or
failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any
error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or
relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of
technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank.  The foregoing provisions of this
clause (f) shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as
opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable
law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and
other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the
absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing
and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face
to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept
and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to
the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms
of such Letter of Credit.

(g)      Disbursement Procedures.  The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting
to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit.  The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Agent and the Borrower by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement
thereunder; provided that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to
reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.

(h)      Interim Interest.  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such
LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from
and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at
the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans; provided that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due
pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section, then Section 2.12(d) shall apply.  Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be
for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant
to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of
such payment.

(i)      Replacement of the Issuing Bank.  The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the
Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of the
Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the

                                                                22

account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.11(b).  From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i)
the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to
Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term "Issuing Bank" shall be deemed to refer to such
successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After
the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all
the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such
replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

(j)      Cash Collateralization.  If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower
receives notice from the Agent or the Required Lenders demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the
Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Agent, in the name of the Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash
equal to the LC Exposure as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided that the obligation to deposit such
cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or
other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of
Article VIII.  Each such deposit shall be held by the Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the
Borrower under this Agreement.  The Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal,
over such account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option
and sole discretion of the Agent and at the Borrower's risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits,
if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Agent to reimburse the
Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the
satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has
been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Required Lenders) be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this
Agreement.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event
of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three Business Days after
all Events of Default have been cured or waived.

SECTION 2.06.     Funding of Borrowings.

(a)      Each Revolving Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of
immediately available funds by 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time, to the account of the Agent most recently designated by it for such
purpose by notice to the Revolving Lenders; provided that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04.  The Agent will
make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the
Borrower maintained with the Agent or by wire transfer, automated clearing house debit or interbank transfer to such other account,
accounts or Persons designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; provided that ABR Revolving Loans made to
finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Agent to the Issuing Bank.

(b)      Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will
not make available to the Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share
available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available
to the Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding

                                                                23

amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans.  If such Lender pays such amount to the Agent, then such amount shall
constitute such Lender's Loan included in such Borrowing.

SECTION 2.07.     Interest Elections.

(a)      Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a
Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.  Thereafter, the Borrower may
elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may
elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall
not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued.

(b)      To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Agent of such election by telephone by the time
that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type
resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall
be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a
form approved by the Agent and signed by the Borrower.

(c)      Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with
Section 2.02 and paragraph (f) of this Section:

(i)      the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to
different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be
specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

(ii)     the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;

(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and

(iv)     if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to
such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term "Interest Period".

         If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.

(d)      Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and
of such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

(e)      If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest
Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default

                                                                24

has occurred and is continuing and the Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an
Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and
(ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable
thereto.

(f)      A Revolving Borrowing may not be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing if after giving effect thereto the
Interest Period therefor would commence before and end after a date on which any principal of the Loans is scheduled to be repaid.

SECTION 2.08.     Termination and Reduction of Revolving Commitments; Extension of Maturity Date.

(a)      Unless previously terminated, the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

(b)      By written notice sent to the Agent (which the Agent shall promptly distribute to the Lenders), the Borrower may request
that the then effective Maturity Date (the "Current Maturity Date") be extended to a date one year from the then Current Maturity
Date (an "Extension Request").  An Extension Request may be delivered by the Borrower to the Agent at any time prior to the date
which is 90 days prior to the then Current Maturity Date when no Default exists.  Within 45 days of the receipt by the Agent of an
Extension Request, each Lender shall provide the Agent and the Borrower with a written consent to, or a rejection of, the Borrower's
Extension Request. The decision whether to accept or reject an Extension Request shall be made by each Lender in its sole discretion
based on such information as it may deem necessary and no Lender shall have any obligation to agree to any extension of the then
Current Maturity Date.  The failure of a Lender to respond to any Extension Request within such 45-day period shall be deemed a
rejection of such request. If all the Lenders consent to an Extension Request, the Maturity Date shall be the date one year from the
then Current Maturity Date as specified in a notice from the Agent.  If Lenders holding 25% or less of the Revolving Exposures and
unused Revolving Commitments reject an Extension Request (the "Rejecting Lenders"), then the Borrower may take one of the following
actions:  (i) by written notice to each Rejecting Lender and the Agent, delivered prior to the then Current Maturity Date, terminate
the Revolving Commitment of each Rejecting Lender if simultaneously with such termination the Borrower pays to each Rejecting Lender
all amounts owed by the Borrower to such Rejecting Lender hereunder or (ii) cause each Rejecting Lender to assign its interest in
the Agreement to a new Lender who will consent to the Extension Request under the terms of Section 2.18(b) on or before the then
Current Maturity Date. If the Borrower consummates either of the foregoing actions on or before the then Current Maturity Date, then
the Maturity Date shall be the date one year from the then Current Maturity Date as specified in a notice from the Agent.

(c)      The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) each
reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$10,000,000 and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent
prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.10, the sum of the Revolving Exposures would exceed the total Revolving
Commitments.

(d)      The Borrower shall notify the Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments under paragraph (c) of
this Section at least three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and
the effective date thereof.  Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.
Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination of the
Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit

                                                                25

facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Agent on or prior to the specified effective
date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be permanent.  Each
reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Revolving
Commitments.

SECTION 2.09.     Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

(a)      The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Revolving Loan of such Lender on the Maturity Date, and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Maturity Date and the first date after such Swingline Loan is made
that is the 15th or last day of a calendar month and is at least two Business Days after such Swingline Loan is made; provided that
on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding.

(b)      Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and
paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

(c)      The Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type
thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder for the
account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

(d)      The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence
of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Agent to maintain
such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

(e)      Any Lender may request that Loans of any Class made by it be evidenced by a promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower
shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such
Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such
promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 10.04) be represented by one
or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered
note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

SECTION 2.10.     Prepayment of Loans.(a)   The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any
Borrowing in whole or in part without premium or penalty except for amounts paid in accordance with Section 2.15, subject to the
requirements of this Section.

(b)      In the event and on such occasion that the sum of the Revolving Exposures exceeds the total Revolving Commitments, the
Borrower shall prepay Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Borrowings (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash
collateral in an account with the Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.

                                                                26

(c)      Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or
Borrowings to be prepaid and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
Section.

(d)      The Borrower shall notify the Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Dallas, Texas time, on the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a
Swingline Loan, not later than 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time, on the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid and, in the case of a
mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount of such prepayment; provided that, if a notice of optional
prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Revolving Commitments as contemplated by Section
2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08.
Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case
of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of
a mandatory prepayment.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12.

SECTION 2.11.     Fees.

(a)      The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the
Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Lender during the period from and including
the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable
in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments
terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
For purposes of computing commitment fees, the Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the
outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of such Lender shall be disregarded for such
purpose).

(b)      The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Agent for the account of each Lender a participation fee with respect to its
participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate as interest on Eurodollar Borrowings on the
average daily amount of such Lender's LC Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements)
during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender's Revolving
Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any LC Exposure, and (ii) to the Issuing Bank, for its own
account, a fronting fee, which shall accrue at the rate of 1/8 % per annum on the average daily amount of the LC Exposure (excluding
any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any LC
Exposure, as well as the Issuing Bank's standard fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of
Credit or processing of drawings thereunder.  Participation fees and fronting fees accrued through and including the last day of
March, June, September and December of each year shall be payable on the third Business Day following such last day, commencing on

                                                                27

the first such date to occur after the Effective Date; provided that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the
Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be
payable on demand.  Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within 10 days after
demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the
actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).

(c)      If the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitments during any period of the calculation of the commitment fee
under Section 2.11(a) equals or exceeds 70.0% of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments in effect during such period,
then the Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a non-utilization fee, which shall accrue at a rate
equal to 0.05% on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of each Lender during such period.  Accrued
non-utilization fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date
on which the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof.  All non-utilization
fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the
first day but excluding the last day).  For purposes of computing non-utilization fees, the Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall
be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and LC Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure of
such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).

(d)      All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Agent (or to the Issuing
Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees, to the Lenders
entitled thereto.  Except in the case of errors in payment which have been confirmed by Agent, fees paid shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

SECTION 2.12.     Interest.

(a)      The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

(b)      The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in
effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

(c)      The Swingline Loans shall bear interest at the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from day to day plus 2.00%.

(d)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the
Borrower hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear
interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus
the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other
amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Borrowings as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

(e)      Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and upon termination
of the Revolving Commitments; provided that (i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on
demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of the
Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such
repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.

                                                                29

(f)      All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to
the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of
365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first
day but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower a
statement showing the quotations used by the Agent in determining any interest rates pursuant to this Section 2.12.

SECTION 2.13.     Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

(a)      the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that through no fault of the Agent
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or

(b)      the Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and
fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders (as certified by such Required Lenders in a written certificate delivered to Agent and
Borrower setting forth in detail the reasons for such Required Lenders' position) of making or maintaining their Loans included in
such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until the Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a
Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be
made as an ABR Borrowing.

SECTION 2.14.     Increased Costs.

(a)      If any Change in Law shall:

(i)      impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or
the Issuing Bank; or

(ii)     impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or
of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of participating in,
issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing
Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the
case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

(b)      If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or the
Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of
Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the
Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's holding company
with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may
be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's
holding company for any such reduction suffered.

(c)      A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth (i) the amount or amounts (including a description of the
method of calculating such amount or amounts), necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as
the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section and (ii) the applicable Change in Law and other facts that
give rise to such amount or amounts shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower
shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.

(d)      Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more
than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law
giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or the Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the
180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

SECTION 2.15.     Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the
last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of the operation of
Section 2.18), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto,
(c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant
hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.10(d) and is revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the
assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by
the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.08 or Section 2.18, then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the
loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall
be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable
to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the
case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over
(ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in
the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower, shall set forth the method of calculating such amount or amounts and
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within 10 days after receipt thereof.

                                                                30

SECTION 2.16.     Taxes.

(a)      Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; provided that if the Borrower shall be
required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary
so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) each
recipient of each such payment receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority
in accordance with applicable law.

(b)      In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law.

(c)      The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent, each Lender, the Issuing Bank, and any other party hereto within 10 days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Agent, such Lender, the Issuing
Bank or other party hereto, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to
amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or
by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall set forth in reasonable detail the origin and
amount of the payments to be due under this Section 2.16(c) and such certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(d)      As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority,
the Borrower shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to
the Agent.

(e)      If a Lender, the Issuing Bank or Agent shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a refund from a Governmental
Authority specifically in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower, or with
respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts, pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall promptly notify Borrower of the
availability of such refund claim and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by Borrower, make a claim to such
Governmental Authority for such refund at Borrower's expense.  If a Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Agent receives a refund
(including pursuant to a claim for refund made pursuant to the preceding sentence) specifically in respect of any Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by Borrower or with respect to which Borrower had paid additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall within 30 days from the date of such receipt pay over such refund to Borrower (but only to
the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by Borrower under this Section 2.16 with respect to the
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender, Issuing Bank or
Agent and without interest (other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); provided,
however, that Borrower, upon the request of such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent, agrees to repay the amount paid over to Borrower
(plus penalties, interest or other charges) to such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent in the event such Lender, Issuing Bank or Agent is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.

                                                                32

(f)      Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement
shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed
and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate.

SECTION 2.17.     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-Offs.

(a)      The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of
principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.14, 2.15 or 2.16, or
otherwise) prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is
expressly required, prior to 12:00 noon, Dallas, Texas time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off
or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Agent, be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the
Agent at its offices in New York, New York, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly
provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 10.03 and the other clauses of this Section 2.17
shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons
specified therein.  The Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the
appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not
a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing
interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments under each Loan Document shall be made
in dollars.

(b)      If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to
such parties.

(c)      If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such
Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in
LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans and participations
in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be
shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any
payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations
in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which

                                                                32

the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively
do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against
the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

(d)      Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent
for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that
the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment,
then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

(e)      If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or (e),
2.06(b), 2.17(d) or 10.03(c), then the Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections
until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

(f)      All proceeds received by the Agent from the sale or other liquidation of the Collateral when an Event of Default exists
shall first be applied as payment of the accrued and unpaid fees of the Agent hereunder and then to all other unpaid or unreimbursed
obligations (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) owing to the Agent in its capacity as Agent only and then any
remaining amount of such proceeds shall be distributed:

(i)      first, to an account at the Agent over which the Agent shall have control in an amount sufficient to fully collateralize
all LC Exposure then outstanding; and

(ii)     second, to the Lenders, pro rata in accordance with the such Lender's Revolving Exposure, until all the Revolving Loans
have been paid and satisfied in full or cash collateralized.

All amounts paid under the terms of the Subsidiary Guaranty shall be applied as provided in paragraph 5 of the Guaranty.

(g)      After all Revolving Commitments are terminated and all other obligations of any Lender to Borrower or any Guarantor are
otherwise satisfied, any proceeds of Collateral shall be delivered to the Person entitled thereto as determined by the Intercreditor
Agreement, by applicable law or applicable court order.

SECTION 2.18.     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

(a)      If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use reasonable
efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not

                                                                34

subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower
hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

(b)      If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, or if any Lender defaults in its
obligation to fund Loans hereunder or if a Lender fails to consent to an Extension Request, then the Borrower may, at its sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Agent (and, if a Revolving
Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and Swingline Lender), which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such
Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC
Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder (including
any amounts due under Section 2.15 other than in connection with an assignment resulting from a Lender's default in its obligations
to fund Loans), from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.16
or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments, and (iv) in the case of any such assignment under the terms of Section 2.08(b) resulting from the rejection of an
Extension Request, such assignment will result in the consent by all Lenders to such Extension Request.  A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

SECTION 2.19.     Increase of Revolving Commitments.  By written notice sent to the Agent (which the Agent shall promptly distribute
to the Lenders), the Borrower may request an increase of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments:  (i) by an aggregate
amount equal to any integral multiple of $5,000,000 and (ii) by an amount not to exceed $50,000,000; provided that (i) no Default
shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments shall not previously have been
increased more than two times pursuant to this Section 2.19.  Each Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall determine
whether it will increase its Revolving Commitment.  If one or more of the Lenders will not be increasing its Revolving Commitment
pursuant to such request, then, with notice to the Agent and the other Lenders, another one or more financial institutions, each as
approved by the Borrower and the Agent (a "New Lender"), may commit to provide an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the
requested increase that will not be provided by the existing Lenders (the "Increase Amount"); provided, that the Revolving
Commitment of each New Lender shall be at least $5,000,000 and the maximum number of New Lenders shall be five (5).  Upon receipt of
notice from the Agent to the Lenders and the Borrower that the Lenders, or sufficient Lenders and New Lenders, have agreed to commit
to an aggregate amount equal to the Increase Amount (or such lesser amount as the Borrower shall agree, which shall be at least
$5,000,000 and an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof), then: provided that no Default exists at such time or after
giving effect to the requested increase, the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders willing to increase their respective Revolving
Commitments and the New Lenders (if any) shall execute and deliver an Increased Commitment Supplement (herein so called) in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C.  If all existing Lenders shall not have provided their pro rata portion of the requested increase,
then after giving effect to the requested increase the outstanding Revolving Loans may not be held pro rata in accordance with the
new Revolving Commitments. In order to remedy the forgoing, on the effective date of the Increased Commitment Supplement the

                                                                34

Borrower shall request a borrowing hereunder which shall be made only by the Lenders who have increased their Revolving Commitment
and, if applicable, the New Lenders.  The proceeds of such borrowing shall be utilized by the Borrower to repay the outstanding
Revolving Loans of Lenders who did not agree to increase their Revolving Commitments, such borrowing and repayments to be in amounts
sufficient so that after giving effect thereto, the Revolving Loans shall be held by the Lenders pro rata according to their
respective Revolving Commitments.  The Revolving Commitments of the Lenders who do not agree to increase their Revolving Commitments
can not be reduced or otherwise changed pursuant to this Section 2.19.

SECTION 2.20.     Exiting Lender; Adjustment of Outstandings.  The Bank of Nova Scotia (herein the "Exiting Lender") has requested
that its Revolving Commitment under the Prior Agreement be terminated.  On the Effective Date, the Revolving Commitment of the
Exiting Lender under the Prior Agreement shall terminate.  The Exiting Lender and the other parties hereto agree that after the
Effective Date: (i) the Exiting Lender's rights hereunder and under the Prior Agreement will be extinguished (except for those
rights under the Prior Agreement that survive the termination of the Prior Agreement) and the Exiting Lender will be released from
its obligations under the Prior Agreement, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (ii)  the Exiting Lender shall no longer be
deemed a "Lender" under this Agreement or the Prior Agreement (except in respect to the provisions of the Prior Agreement which
survive its termination); and (iii) this Agreement may be amended or otherwise modified without the Exiting Lender's consent or
agreement except the consent of the Exiting Lender shall be required for any amendment or other modification of this Section 2.20
which affects the Exiting Lender).  Because of the termination of the Exiting Lender's Revolving Commitment in effect under the
Prior Agreement and the changes in the other Revolving Commitments contemplated hereby, the outstanding Revolving Loans may not be
held pro rata in accordance with the new Revolving Commitments as herein set forth.  In order to remedy the forgoing, on the
Effective Date, the Borrower shall request a borrowing hereunder which shall be made only by the Lenders whose pro rata portions
have increased as compared to the pro rata portions under the Prior Agreement.  The proceeds of such borrowing shall be utilized by
the Borrower to repay the outstanding Revolving Loans and other obligations of the Exiting Lender and to reduce the outstanding
amount of the Revolving Loans of the Lenders whose pro rata portions decreased (as compared to the pro rata portions under the Prior
Agreement), such borrowing and repayments among the Lenders to be in amounts sufficient so that after giving effect thereto, the
Revolving Loans shall be held by the Lenders pro rata according to their respective Revolving Commitments as established hereunder.
The amounts funded under the foregoing sentence shall be deemed an ABR Loan (unless otherwise requested by the Borrower under the
terms hereof) and a continuation and assignment of the Revolving Loans made by the Lenders receiving such funds. The Borrower agrees
to pay each Lender receiving such funds under the foregoing sentence any amounts due under Section 2.15 of the Prior Agreement
arising from the payment of any Eurodollar Loan in existence under the Prior Agreement prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto resulting from such receipt of funds.

                                                                ARTICLE III.

                                                    Representations and Warranties

         The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

SECTION 3.01.     Organization; Powers.  Each of the Borrower and each Subsidiary is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and authority to carry on its business as
now conducted and is qualified to do business in, and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                                                                35

SECTION 3.02.     Authorization; Enforceability.  The Loan Documents to be entered into by the Borrower and each Guarantor are
within their respective corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and, if required, stockholder
action. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which
the Borrower or any of the Guarantors is to be a party, when executed and delivered, will constitute, a legal, valid and binding
obligation of, the Borrower or such Guarantor (as the case may be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and subject to
general principles of equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

SECTION 3.03.     Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.  The execution, performance and delivery of the Loan Documents by the
Borrower and the Guarantors (a) do not require any consent or approval of, registration or filing with (other than the inclusion of
this Agreement as an exhibit to routine filings under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), or any other action by, any Governmental
Authority, (b) will not violate any applicable law or regulation or the charter, by-laws or other organizational documents of the

result in a material default under any indenture, agreement or other instrument (including the Subordinated Debt Documents, the
Synthetic Airplane Lease Facility, and the Synthetic Equipment Lease Facility) binding upon the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries
or its assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, and
(d) will not result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.04.     Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.

(a)      The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its consolidated balance sheet and statements of income, stockholders
equity and cash flows (i) as of and for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002 reported on by independent public accountants, and
(ii) as of and for the fiscal quarter and the portion of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, certified by its chief financial
officer.  Such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position and results of operations and
cash flows of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries as of such dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end
audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clause (ii) above.

(b)      Except: (i) as disclosed in the financial statements referred to above or the notes thereto and (ii) for the Disclosed
Matters, none of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries has, as of the Effective Date, any contingent liabilities, unusual long-term
commitments or unrealized losses which could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(c)      Except for the Disclosed Matters, since September 30, 2002 there has been no material adverse change in the business,
assets, operations or financial condition of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

SECTION 3.05.     Properties.

(a)      Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real and personal
property material to its business (including its Collateral), except for minor defects in title that do not interfere with its
ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances and Liens permitted by clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 6.02;

                                                                36

(b)      Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed to use, all trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, patents and
other intellectual property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and the Subsidiaries does not infringe
upon the rights of any other Person, except for any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

(c)      As of the Effective Date, neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries has received notice of, or has knowledge of, any
pending or contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any Mortgaged Property or any other real property owned by it or any sale
or disposition thereof in lieu of condemnation.  Neither any such real property nor any interest therein is subject to any right of
first refusal, option or other contractual right to purchase such real property or interest therein.

SECTION 3.06.     Litigation and Environmental Matters.

(a)      There are no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental Authority pending against or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (i) as to which there is a
reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents, the Subordinated Debt
Documents, the Synthetic Airplane Lease Facility, and the Synthetic Equipment Lease Facility.

to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain, maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii) has received notice of any claim with respect to
any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of any basis for any Environmental Liability.

(c)      The Disclosed Matters, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  Since the date of this Agreement, there has been no change in the status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in
the aggregate, has resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.07.     Compliance with Laws and Agreements.  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all laws,
regulations and orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other
instruments binding upon it or its property, except where the failure to do so, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  No Default has occurred and is continuing.

SECTION 3.08.     Investment and Holding Company Status.  Neither the Borrower nor any of the Subsidiaries is (a) an "investment
company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or (b) a "holding company" as defined in,
or subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

SECTION 3.09.     Taxes.  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and
reports required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have been paid by it, except (a) Taxes
that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as applicable, has
set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect.

                                                                37

SECTION 3.10.     ERISA.  No ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken together with all other
such ERISA Events for which liability is reasonably expected to occur, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect.  The present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such
amounts, exceed by more than $5,000,000 of the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more
than $5,000,000 of the fair market value of the assets of all such underfunded Plans.

SECTION 3.11.     Disclosure.  The Borrower has disclosed to the Lenders all agreements, instruments and corporate or other
restrictions to which the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is subject, and all other matters known to any of them, that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.  No reports, financial
statements, certificates or other information furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower to the Agent or any Lender in connection
with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented
by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided that, with respect to
projected financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

SECTION 3.12.     Subsidiaries.  As of February 5, 2003, Borrower has no Subsidiaries other than those listed on Schedule 3.12
hereto.  As of February 5, 2003, Schedule 3.12 sets forth the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each such Subsidiary,
the percentage of Borrower's ownership of the outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary directly owned by Borrower, the
percentage of each Subsidiary's ownership of the outstanding Equity Interests of each other Subsidiary and the authorized, issued
and outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary.  All of the outstanding Equity Interests of each Subsidiary has been validly
issued, are fully paid, and nonassessable.  Except as permitted to be issued or created pursuant to the terms hereof or as reflected
on Schedule 3.12, there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, or rights (including preemptive rights) to
acquire, and no outstanding securities or instruments convertible into any Equity Interests of the Borrower or any Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.13.     Insurance.  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries maintain with financially sound and reputable insurers,
insurance with respect to its properties and business against such casualties and contingencies and in such amounts as are usually
carried by businesses engaged in similar activities as the Borrower and the Subsidiaries and located in similar geographic areas in
which the Borrower and the Subsidiaries operate.

SECTION 3.14.     Labor Matters.  As of the Effective Date, there are no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any
Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened.  The hours worked by and payments made to employees of the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal, state,
local or foreign law dealing with such matters in any material respect.  All material amounts due from the Borrower or any
Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and
welfare insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.15.     Solvency. Immediately following the making of each Loan and after giving effect to the application of the proceeds
of such Loans, (a) the fair value of the assets of Borrower and each Guarantor, at a fair valuation, will exceed its debts and

                                                                38

liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of Borrower and each
Guarantor will be greater than the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute and matured; (c) Borrower and each
Guarantor will be able to pay its debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured; and (d) Borrower and each Guarantor will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the
business in which it is engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed to be conducted following the Effective Date.  As
used in this Section 3.15, the term "fair value" means the amount at which the applicable assets would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller within a reasonable time, each having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts, neither being
under any compulsion to act, with equity to both and "present fair saleable value" means the amount that may be realized if the
applicable company's aggregate assets are sold with reasonable promptness in an arm's length transaction under present conditions
for the sale of a comparable business enterprises.

SECTION 3.16.     Margin Securities.  Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary is engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulations U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), and, except for the repurchases of the Borrower's
capital stock in accordance with the limitations in Section 6.08, no part of the proceeds of any Loan will be used to purchase or
carry any margin stock or to extend credit to others for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock.

SECTION 3.17.     Senior Indebtedness.  The Indebtedness under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitutes "Senior
Indebtedness" and "Designated Senior Indebtedness" under and as defined in the Subordinated Debt Documents.

                                                                ARTICLE IV.

thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and payable immediately, without
notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any event with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article,
the  Revolving Commitments shall automatically terminate and the principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued
interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall automatically become due and payable,
without notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration, presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of

which are hereby waived by the Borrower.  In addition to the other rights and remedies that the Lenders may have upon the occurrence

the Collateral Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Mortgages and the Security Agreements and (ii) the Agent to exercise the
rights and remedies available to it under the Subsidiary Guaranty.

                                                                ARTICLE IX.

                                                                 Agent

         Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Agent as its agent (and confirms and continues
such appointment under the Prior Agreement) and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers
as are delegated to it by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto.

         The bank serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend
money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were
not the Agent hereunder.

         The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether
a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Agent is required
to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Agent shall not have
any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Agent
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the
absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless
and until written notice thereof is given to the Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Agent shall not be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan
Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii) the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v)
the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of items
expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.

         The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request,
certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent
by the proper Person.  The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by
the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be
counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

                                                                62

         The Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Agent.  The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent
and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with
the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Agent.

         Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor as provided in this paragraph, the Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Borrower.  Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in
consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank, appoint a successor Agent.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the
Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the
Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and
such successor.  After the Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect
for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as the Agent.

         Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any other Lender or any of their
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision
to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent, any
other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

         U.S. Bank National Association and Bank of America, N.A. have been designated as "documentation agent" and "syndication
agent" hereunder respectively in recognition of the level of each of their Revolving Commitments.  Neither U.S. Bank National
Association nor Bank of America, N.A. is an agent for the Lenders and no such Lender shall have any obligation hereunder other than
those existing in its capacity as a Lender.  Without limiting the foregoing, no such Lender shall have or be deemed to have any
fiduciary relationship with or duty to any Lender.

         The Lenders hereby authorize JPMorgan Chase Bank (in its capacity as the "Agent" hereunder and in its capacity as the "
Collateral Agent") to sign the following on behalf of each Lender and to bind each Lender to the terms thereof as if each Lender
were directly a party thereto: (i) the Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) an agreement pursuant to which the Collateral Agent agrees
that after receipt of the Termination Value in accordance with the Operative Agreements (as those terms are defined in the
documentation governing the Synthetic Real Property Lease and provided neither the Termination Value nor any portion thereof shall
have been disgorged, reclaimed or ordered to be returned) and at all times thereafter: (a) each Lender and Holder (as those terms
are defined in the documentation governing the Synthetic Real Property Lease), solely in such capacity, will no longer be deemed a
"Creditor" under the Original Intercreditor Agreement nor have any obligations of a "Creditor" thereunder and (b) Bank of America as
agent for the Synthetic Lenders (as defined in the Original Intercreditor Agreement), solely in such capacity, shall no longer be
deemed an "Agent" under the Original Intercreditor Agreement nor have any obligations of an "Agent" thereunder.

                                                                63

                                                                ARTICLE X.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other
parties hereto.  All notices and other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

SECTION 10.02.    Waivers; Amendments.

(a)      No failure or delay by the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver
of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower or any Guarantor therefrom shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of
a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the Agent, any
Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

(b)      Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified
except (x) pursuant to an Increased Commitment Supplement executed in accordance with Section 2.19 which only needs to be signed by
the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders increasing or providing new Revolving Commitments thereunder if the Increased Commitment
Supplement does not increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments to an amount in excess of $200,000,000 and (y) in the
case of this Agreement and any circumstance other than as described in clause (x), pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or

                                                                64

agreements in writing entered into by the parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no
such agreement shall (i) increase  the Revolving Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce
the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of
any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any
such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Revolving Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender
affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.17(b), (c) or (f) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required
thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of "Required
Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or
modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender,
(vi) release any Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty or limit its liability in respect of the Subsidiary Guaranty without the
consent of each Lender, nor (v) change Section 2.20 in any manner that might affect the Exiting Lender without the consent of the
Exiting Lender; provided further that (1) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline
Lender, as the case may be and (2) the Agent shall be obligated and shall have the power without the consent of any Lender to
release a Guarantor from the Subsidiary Guaranty if the Guarantor is sold in accordance with the restrictions on the disposition of
assets set forth in Section 6.05 or, if the Guarantor is the Synthetic Real Property Subsidiary, if such release is required in
connection with the financing permitted by Section 6.01(a)(xii)(C).

out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter
of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any

in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during
any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit.

(b)      THE BORROWER SHALL INDEMNIFY THE AGENT, J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES INC., BANC OF AMERICA SECURITIES LLC, THE ISSUING BANK AND
EACH LENDER, AND EACH RELATED PARTY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING PERSONS (EACH SUCH PERSON BEING CALLED AN "INDEMNITEE") AGAINST, AND
HOLD EACH INDEMNITEE HARMLESS FROM, ANY AND ALL LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE FEES,
CHARGES AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY COUNSEL FOR ANY INDEMNITEE, INCURRED BY OR ASSERTED AGAINST ANY INDEMNITEE ARISING OUT OF, IN
CONNECTION WITH, OR AS A RESULT OF (I) THE EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, THE PERFORMANCE BY THE PARTIES TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS THEREUNDER OR THE

                                                                65

CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, (II) ANY LOAN OR LETTER OF CREDIT OR THE USE OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM
(INCLUDING ANY REFUSAL BY THE ISSUING BANK TO HONOR A DEMAND FOR PAYMENT UNDER A LETTER OF CREDIT IF THE DOCUMENTS PRESENTED IN
CONNECTION WITH SUCH DEMAND DO NOT STRICTLY COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH LETTER OF CREDIT), (III) ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED PRESENCE OR
RELEASE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON OR FROM ANY REAL PROPERTY CURRENTLY OR FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED BY THE BORROWER OR ANY OF THE
SUBSIDIARIES, OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE BORROWER OR ANY OF THE SUBSIDIARIES, OR (IV) ANY ACTUAL OR
PROSPECTIVE CLAIM, LITIGATION, INVESTIGATION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO ANY OF THE FOREGOING, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY
OTHER THEORY AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY INDEMNITEE IS A PARTY THERETO; PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY
INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT
OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY FINAL AND NONAPPEALABLE JUDGMENT TO HAVE RESULTED FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF
SUCH INDEMNITEE.  IT IS THE EXPRESSED INTENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT THE INDEMNITY IN THIS CLAUSE (b) SHALL, AS TO ANY
INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED TO HAVE
RESULTED FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH INDEMNITEE.

(c)      To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent, the Issuing Bank or
the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agent, the Issuing Bank or the
Swingline Lender in its capacity as such.  For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined based upon its share
of the sum of the total Revolving Exposures and unused Revolving Commitments at the time.

(d)      To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any
Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby,
any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.

(e)      All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefor.

SECTION 10.04.    Successors and Assigns.

(a)      The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that
(i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no
Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.  Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), Participants

                                                                66

(to the extent provided in clause (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each
of the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b)      (i)  Subject to the conditions set forth in clause (b)(ii) below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans at
the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

(A)      the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to any other assignee; and

(B)      the Agent, provided that no consent of the Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Revolving Commitment to an
assignee that is a Lender with a Revolving Commitment immediately prior to giving effect to such assignment.

(ii)     Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:

(A)      except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or an assignment of the
entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Revolving Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Revolving Commitment or Loans of
the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Agent otherwise consent,
provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

(B)      each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement;

(C)      the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500; and

(D)      the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

         For the purposes of this Section 10.04(b), the term "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that is
engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an
entity that administers or manages a Lender.

(iii)    Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to clause (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03).  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that
does not comply with this Section 10.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation
in such rights and obligations in accordance with clause (c) of this Section.

                                                                67

(iv)     The Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the
Revolving Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank
and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the
Borrower, the Issuing Bank and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(v)      Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the
assignee's completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in clause (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by clause (b) of this
Section, the Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this clause.

(c)      (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the
sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan
Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant,
agree to any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 10.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to clause (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause
(b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.17(c) as though it were a Lender.

                           (ii)  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.14 or 2.16 than
the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a
Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Borrower is notified of the
participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.16(f)
as though it were a Lender.

(d)      Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to
secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or
assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

                                                                68

SECTION 10.05.    Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower in the Loan Documents and
in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall
be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan
Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other
party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any
Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement
is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Revolving Commitments have not expired or
terminated.  The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 and Article IX shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or
termination of the Letters of Credit and the Revolving Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

SECTION 10.06.    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Amendment and Restatement. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND ANY SEPARATE LETTER
AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO FEES PAYABLE TO THE AGENT EMBODY THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT
MATTER HEREOF AND SUPERSEDE ANY AND ALL PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND UNDERSTANDINGS, WHETHER ORAL OR
WRITTEN, RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF (INCLUDING THE PRIOR AGREEMENT) AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY EVIDENCE OF
PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO  THERE ARE NO UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS
AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed
by the Agent and the Borrower and when the Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns.  Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement amends and restates in its
entirety the Prior Agreement.  The execution of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents executed in connection herewith does not
extinguish the commitment under or the indebtedness outstanding in connection with the Prior Agreement nor does it constitute a
novation with respect to such commitment or such indebtedness.  The Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders ratify and confirm each of
the Loan Documents entered into prior to the Effective Date (but excluding the Prior Agreement) and agree that such Loan Documents
continue to be legal, valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms.  However, for all matters arising
prior to the Effective Date (including the accrual and payment of interest and fees, and matters relating to indemnification and
compliance with financial covenants), the terms of the Prior Agreement (as unmodified by this Agreement) shall control and are
hereby ratified and confirmed.  The Borrower and each Guarantor represents and warrants that as of the Effective Date there are no
claims or offsets against or defenses or counterclaims to its obligations under the Prior Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.  TO INDUCE THE LENDERS AND THE AGENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE BORROWER AND EACH GUARANTOR WAIVES ANY AND ALL
SUCH CLAIMS, OFFSETS, DEFENSES OR COUNTERCLAIMS, WHETHER KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ARISING PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE AND RELATING TO THE
LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and

                                                                69

notwithstanding any Loan Document to the contrary, the Borrower, the Guarantors, the Agent and the Lenders agree and acknowledge
that:

(A)      the term "Credit Agreement" as used in each Loan Document means this Agreement;

(B)      the term "Guaranteed Indebtedness" as used in the Subsidiary Guaranty and the term "Revolver Obligations" as used in the
Intercreditor Agreement includes all of the obligations, indebtedness and liability of the Borrower to the Agent, the Issuing Bank
and the Lenders, or any of them, arising pursuant to this Agreement; and

(C)      any reference to The Chase Manhattan Bank or Chase Bank of Texas, National Association in any Loan Document executed prior
to the Effective Date shall mean a reference to JPMorgan Chase Bank.

SECTION 10.07.    Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 10.08.    Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its
Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any
and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have
made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

SECTION 10.09.    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

(a)      This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the State of Texas.

(b)      THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY SUBMITS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS PROPERTY, TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION
OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF TEXAS SITTING IN DALLAS COUNTY AND OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT
OF TEXAS, AND ANY APPELLATE COURT FROM ANY THEREOF, IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT, OR
FOR RECOGNITION OR ENFORCEMENT OF ANY JUDGMENT, AND EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT
ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN SUCH TEXAS STATE OR, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
BY LAW, IN SUCH FEDERAL COURT.  EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE
CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.  NOTHING IN

                                                                70

THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE AGENT, THE ISSUING BANK OR ANY LENDER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE
TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTIES IN
THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

(c)      The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such
action or proceeding in any such court.

(d)      Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in
Section 10.01.  Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve
process in any other manner permitted by law.

SECTION 10.10.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY
HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES
HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

SECTION 10.11.    Headings.  Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference
only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into consideration in interpreting, this
Agreement.

SECTION 10.12.    Confidentiality.  The Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the
Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such
disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations
or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of
rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section,
to any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, (g) with the consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information:  (i) becomes publicly available other than as
a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis from a source other than the Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the
Borrower relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Agent, the Issuing Bank
or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received
from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person

                                                                71

required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its
obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

SECTION 10.13.    Maximum Interest Rate.

(a)      No interest rate specified in any Loan Document shall at any time exceed the Maximum Rate. If at any time the interest rate
(the "Contract Rate") for any obligation under the Loan Documents shall exceed the Maximum Rate, thereby causing the interest
accruing on such obligation to be limited to the Maximum Rate, then any subsequent reduction in the Contract Rate for such
obligation shall not reduce the rate of interest on such obligation below the Maximum Rate until the aggregate amount of interest
accrued on such obligation equals the aggregate amount of interest which would have accrued on such obligation if the Contract Rate
for such obligation had at all times been in effect.  As used herein, the term "Maximum Rate" means, at any time with respect to any
Lender, the maximum rate of nonusurious interest under applicable law that such Lender may charge Borrower.  The Maximum Rate shall
be calculated in a manner that takes into account any and all fees, payments, and other charges contracted for, charged, or received
in connection with the Loan Documents that constitute interest under applicable law.  Each change in any interest rate provided for
herein based upon the Maximum Rate resulting from a change in the Maximum Rate shall take effect without notice to Borrower at the
time of such change in the Maximum Rate.  For purposes of determining the Maximum Rate under Texas law, the applicable rate ceiling
shall be the weekly rate ceiling described in, and computed in accordance with, Article 5069-1.04, Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes.

(b)      No provision of any Loan Document shall require the payment or the collection of interest in excess of the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law.  If any excess of interest in such respect is hereby provided for, or shall be adjudicated to be so
provided, in any Loan Document or otherwise in connection with this loan transaction, the provisions of this Section shall govern
and prevail and neither Borrower nor the sureties, guarantors, successors, or assigns of Borrower shall be obligated to pay the
excess amount of such interest or any other excess sum paid for the use, forbearance, or detention of sums loaned pursuant hereto.
In the event any Lender ever receives, collects, or applies as interest any such sum, such amount which would be in excess of the
maximum amount permitted by applicable law shall be applied as a payment and reduction of the principal of the obligations
outstanding hereunder, and, if the principal of the obligations outstanding hereunder has been paid in full, any remaining excess
shall forthwith be paid to the Borrower.  In determining whether or not the interest paid or payable exceeds the Maximum Rate,
Borrower and each Lender shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any non-principal payment as an expense,
fee, or premium rather than as interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate,
allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the entire contemplated term of the
obligations outstanding hereunder so that interest for the entire term does not exceed the Maximum Rate.

(c)      The provisions of Chapter 346 of the Finance Code of Texas are specifically declared by the parties hereto not to be
applicable to this Agreement  or to the transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 10.14.    Intercompany Subordination.

(a)      Borrower agrees that the Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined below) shall be subordinate and junior in right of payment
to the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness (as defined below) as herein provided.  The Subordinated Indebtedness shall
not be payable, and no payment of principal, interest or other amounts on account thereof, and no property or guarantee of any
nature to secure or pay the Subordinated Indebtedness shall be made or given, directly or indirectly by or on behalf of any
Guarantor or received, accepted, retained or applied by Borrower unless and until the Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in
full in cash; except that prior to the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, each Guarantor shall have the right to

                                                                72

make payments, and the Borrower shall have the right to receive payments on the Subordinated Indebtedness from time to time as may
be determined by Borrower.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no payments of principal,
interest or other amounts may be made or given, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of any Guarantor or received, accepted,
retained or applied by Borrower unless and until the Senior Indebtedness shall have been paid in full in cash.  If any sums shall be
paid to Borrower by any Guarantor or any other Person on account of the Subordinated Indebtedness when such payment is not permitted
hereunder, such sums shall be held in trust by the Borrower for the benefit of Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to
and applied by Agent against the Senior Indebtedness in accordance with the terms hereof.  For purposes of this Section 10.14, the
term (i) "Subordinated Indebtedness" means, with respect to a Guarantor, all indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations of such
Guarantor to Borrower, whether such indebtedness, liabilities, and obligations now exist or are hereafter incurred or arise, or are
direct, indirect, contingent, primary, secondary, several, joint and several, or otherwise, and irrespective of whether such
indebtedness, liabilities, or obligations are evidenced by a note, contract, open account, or otherwise, and irrespective of the
Person or Persons in whose favor such indebtedness, obligations, or liabilities may, at their inception, have been, or may hereafter
be created, or the manner in which they have been or may hereafter be acquired by Borrower and (ii) "Senior Indebtedness" means,
with respect to each Guarantor, all of the obligations, indebtedness and liability of the such Guarantor to the Agent, the Issuing
Bank and the Lenders, or any of them, arising pursuant to the Subsidiary Guaranty or any of the other Loan Documents, whether now
existing or hereafter arising, whether direct, indirect, related, unrelated, fixed, contingent, liquidated, unliquidated, joint,
several, or joint and several, including, without limitation, any and all post-petition interest and expenses (including attorneys'
fees) whether or not allowed under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar law.

(b)      Borrower agrees that any and all Liens (including any judgment liens), upon any Guarantor's assets securing payment of any
Subordinated Indebtedness shall be and remain inferior and subordinate to any and all Liens upon any Guarantor's assets securing
payment of the Senior Indebtedness or any part thereof, regardless of whether such Liens in favor of Borrower, Agent or any Lender
presently exist or are hereafter created or attached.  Without the prior written consent of Agent, Borrower shall not (i) file suit
against any Guarantor or exercise or enforce any other creditor's right it may have against any Guarantor, or (ii) foreclose,
repossess, sequester, or otherwise take steps or institute any action or proceedings (judicial or otherwise, including without
limitation the commencement of, or joinder in, any liquidation, bankruptcy, rearrangement, debtor's relief or insolvency proceeding)
to enforce any obligations of any Guarantor to Borrower or any Liens held by Borrower on assets of any Guarantor.

(c)      In the event of any receivership, bankruptcy, reorganization, rearrangement, debtor's relief, or other insolvency
proceeding involving any Guarantor as debtor, Agent shall have the right to prove and vote any claim under the Subordinated
Indebtedness and to receive directly from the receiver, trustee or other court custodian all dividends, distributions, and payments
made in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness until the Senior Indebtedness has been paid in full in cash. Agent may apply any
such dividends, distributions, and payments against the Senior Indebtedness in accordance with the terms hereof.

(d)      Borrower agrees that all promissory notes and other instruments evidencing Subordinated Indebtedness shall contain a
specific written notice thereon that the indebtedness evidenced thereby is subordinated under the terms of this Section 10.14.

                                                                73

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized
officers as of the day and year first above written.

         Re:      Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 5, 2003  (the "Agreement") among Acxiom
                  Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), JPMorgan Chase Bank, as the agent and Bank of America, N.A.,
                  as syndication agent and the other lenders named therein.

                  Amended and Restated Intercreditor Agreement dated February 5, 2003 among the Company, the Guarantors, the Agent
                  and JP Morgan Chase Bank as the collateral agent thereunder (the "Intercreditor Agreement").

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We are special counsel to the Company. As such, we have been asked to render to you the opinion set forth below relating to
the Agreement.  This opinion is given pursuant to Section 4.01(b) of the Agreement. Capitalized terms used herein, not otherwise
defined, have the meanings given them in the Agreement. The Agreement and the Intercreditor Amendment, together with that certain
Fourth Amendment to Security Agreement, dated as of February 5, 2003, executed by the Company and that certain Subsidiary Joinder
Agreement, dated as of February 5, 2003 by Acxiom Interim Holdings, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ("AIHI") in favor of the Agent,
are herein collectively referred to as the "Transaction Documents."

         In preparing this opinion, we have reviewed originals or copies (certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction) of
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company, the Transaction Documents, the records of proceedings of the Board of
Directors of the Company and the Guarantors, and such other documents, corporate records and certificates of public officials as we
have considered appropriate.

         For purposes of this opinion, we have, with your permission, assumed without independent investigation or inquiry that:

                  (i)      all signatures of the Lenders on the Transaction Documents we examined are genuine, the
         Transaction Documents submitted to us as originals are authentic, and the Transaction Documents submitted to us as
         copies conform to the original Transaction Documents executed by the parties thereto;

                  (ii)     the Transaction Documents have been duly and validly authorized, executed, delivered and accepted
         by all parties thereto (other than the Company and the Guarantors) and all parties thereto (other than the Company
         and the Guarantors) have all requisite power and authority to make and enter into the Transaction Documents and
         perform their obligations thereunder pursuant to the laws of all relevant jurisdictions;

                                                                1

                  (iii)    the Agent and the Lenders have their principal place of business, chief executive office and
         domicile outside of the State of Arkansas; all substantive negotiations relating to the transactions contemplated by
         the Transaction Documents have taken place outside the State of Arkansas, either in person or by telephone
         conferences between your representatives in the State of Texas and representatives of the Company in the State of
         Arkansas; all credit decisions were made and approved by the Lenders outside the State of Arkansas, acceptance by
         the Lenders or their counsel of the Transaction Documents occurred in the State of Texas; the administration of and
         delivery and acceptance of payments pursuant to the Transaction Documents will take place in the States of Texas or
         New York; the choice of law as provided for in the Transaction Documents is valid pursuant to the conflicts of laws
         principles under the laws of any and all jurisdictions governing the same (other than the State of Arkansas)
         specifically including the laws of the States of Texas and New York; and, the parties to the Transaction Documents
         have voluntarily chosen to have the laws of the State of Texas to govern the Transaction Documents;

                  (iv)     the Transaction Documents were entered into in good faith and for adequate consideration;

                  (v)      the Agent and the Lenders will exercise their rights, remedies and benefits under the Transaction
         Documents in a commercially reasonable manner, and

                  (vi)     to the extent that (a) borrowings under the Agreement are used to fund the purchase by the Company
         of shares of its common stock and (b) the value of such shares so purchased exceeds 25% of the value of all
         Collateral pledged to collateral agent (the "Excess Shares"), the Company will cancel such Excess Shares and shall
         not hold such Excess Shares as treasury stock.

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the qualifications and limitations set forth below, we are of the opinion that:

         1.       The Company and each Guarantor are organized under the laws of the States of either Arkansas or Delaware
(collectively the "Loan Parties") have been duly organized and are validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of their respective incorporation or organization as reflected in the Agreement.  Based solely on the Certificates of good standing
issued by the Secretary of State of such States, each Guarantor organized under the laws of the States of California or Illinois are
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of their respective incorporation.  AIHI's authorized
capitalization consists of 200,000 common shares, of which 1000 shares are issued and outstanding and 1000 preferred shares of which
no shares are issued and outstanding. The outstanding shares of AIHI have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and non-assessable.

         2.       Each Loan Party has the corporate power and authority to enter into and perform the Transaction Documents to which
it is a party.  The execution, delivery and performance of the Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on behalf of each Loan Party, and the Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered by each Loan
Party that is a party thereto.

         3.       The Transaction Documents constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Loan Parties, enforceable against
the Loan Parties in accordance with their respective terms.

         4.      The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, and the performance by each Loan Party of their respective
terms, does not conflict with or result in a violation of law, rule or regulation, the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of

                                                                2

any Loan Party, or of any agreement, instrument, order, writ, judgment or decree known to us to which any Loan Party is a party or
is subject.

         5.      No consent, approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any governmental authority is required in
connection with the execution and delivery by any Loan Party of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

         6.      A court of the State of Arkansas presented with the facts as we have assumed them and properly applying the current
conflict of law principles, would honor the choice of law provisions as set forth in the Transaction Documents and would not apply
the substantive laws of the State of Arkansas, including usury laws to the Transaction Documents, except for certain issues
necessarily governed by Arkansas law such as title to properties and remedies and procedures for enforcement in Arkansas.

         7.      To our knowledge, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against or affecting the Company
or any Subsidiary or any of their respective properties in any court or before any arbitrator of any kind or before or by any
Governmental Authority that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in the Agreement).

         8.      In the event the laws of the State of Arkansas were deemed to apply to the Transaction Documents, the terms thereof
would not be deemed to violate any applicable law of the State regulating or restricting the amounts payable as interest, principal
or otherwise to the Lenders.

         9.      The execution and delivery by the Loan Parties of the Transaction Documents, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents and the performance of the terms and provisions of the Transaction Documents by each Loan
Party will not involve any violations of Regulation T, U or X or any other rule or regulation of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System pursuant to Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

         10.     The Company is not an investment company, or a person directly or indirectly controlled by or acting on behalf of
an investment company, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

         11.     The indebtedness under the Agreement constitutes "Senior Indebtedness" as defined under the Subordinated Debt
Documents.

         The opinions hereinafter expressed are subject to the following qualifications and limitations:

         (a)     We are members of the bar of the State of Arkansas only and we express no opinion as to the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States of America, the State of Arkansas and the General Corporate Laws of the State of Delaware.

         (b)     This opinion is limited to pertinent laws in effect as of the date hereof, and we expressly disclaim any
undertaking to advise you of any changes of law or fact that may thereafter come to our attention.

         (c)     Our opinion is limited to the matters stated herein and no opinion is to be implied or may be inferred beyond those
matters expressly stated.  The opinions expressed herein represent our judgment as to certain legal matters, but they are not
warranties or guarantees and should not be construed as such.  The liability of this firm is limited to the fullest extent possible
under Ark. Code Ann. Section 16-114-303; provided, however, the requirements of such section necessary to allow the Lenders to rely
on this opinion have been satisfied.

                                                                3

         (d)     This opinion is furnished by us solely for your benefit, and it may not be relied upon, quoted from or delivered to
any person other than counsel to you and your agents or employees and participants without our express prior written consent, except
(i) in connection with the enforcement of obligations of the Loan Parties under the Transaction Documents, (ii) in response to a
valid subpoena or other legal process, (iii) as otherwise required by applicable law or regulations, or (iv) in connection with the
sale or transfer of the rights under the Agreement to a subsequent purchaser or transferee.

         (e)     The phrase "known to us" as used in this letter means the actual knowledge of those attorneys of our firm who have
performed services in connection with the Transaction Documents and this opinion based solely on representations from the Company,
and does not include constructive knowledge or knowledge imputed to our firm under common law principles of agency or otherwise.
Except as expressly set forth herein, we have not undertaken any investigation to determine the existence or absence of any facts
and no inference as to our knowledge concerning any facts should be drawn from the fact that such representation has been undertaken
by us.

         (f)      For purposes of the factual matters material to the opinions expressed herein, we have, with your consent, relied
upon the correctness of the representations contained in the Transaction Documents and the factual assumptions stated therein.

         (g)      Our opinions are rendered as of the date hereof and do not cover the effect of any amendment or supplement to the
Transaction Documents or the validity or enforceability of any amendment or supplement thereto, including without limitation any
refinancings, modifications, extensions, waivers or releases or the effect or applicability of federal or state tax laws on or to
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

         (h)      We have made no examination or investigation to verify the accuracy or completeness of any financial, accounting,
or statistical information furnished to you or with respect to any other accounting and financial matters and express no opinion
with respect thereto.

         (i)      We call your attention to the fact that the awarding of attorney's fees and expenses is discretionary under
Arkansas law.  We cannot opine that attorney's fees and expenses will be awarded or if awarded, such award will be in any particular
amount.
         (j)      Our opinion herein concerning usury specifically excludes any opinion as to whether the fees, expenses and costs
paid or to be paid by the Company or any Guarantor to the Lenders constitute interest under applicable Arkansas law. Reasonable late
payment fees or charges imposed on a one-time basis only and for the purpose of encouraging prompt payment of amounts due on the
Loans are not generally considered interest under applicable Arkansas law.  Further, reasonable and actual attorneys' fees and
expenses associated with the preparation of the Transaction Documents and reasonable and actual out-of-pocket charges and expenses
of the Lenders in making and securing the Loans are not generally considered interest under applicable state law, provided, however,
to the extent any such charges and expenses paid by the Company are deemed payment or reimbursement of a Lender's general overhead
expenses, such charges may be deemed interest.  Our opinion concerning usury specifically assumes the preemption of Arkansas law by
12 U.S.C. &amp;1831u(f), 12 U.S.C. &amp;85 and 12 U.S.C. &amp;36, and the validity, enforceability and constitutionality of those
laws.

         (k)      Our opinions are subject to, and we express no opinion on, state or federal law relating to fraudulent conveyances.

         (l)      The opinions expressed above are (i) given to the addressees hereof solely for their benefit and the benefit of
their successors and transferees (including any assignee or participant in the Loans under the Agreement) and it is acknowledged
that each such Loan Party has relied on same, (ii) not binding on any court and (iii) may not be quoted in whole or in part or

                                                                4

otherwise referred to in any legal opinion, document, or other report to be furnished to another person or entity without our prior
written consent; provided, however, that you may furnish this opinion to any proposed assignee or participant in the Loans under the
Agreement.

                                                             Very truly yours,


                                                                5

                                                            5 February 2003



                                             AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT

         THIS AMENDED AND RESTATED INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of February 5, 2003, is by and among,
JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank who was successor in interest by merger to Chase Bank of Texas, National
Association), as agent for the lenders under the Revolver Agreement (as such term is hereafter defined and in such capacity and its
successors in such capacity, the "Revolver Agent"), JPMORGAN CHASE BANK (formerly The Chase Manhattan Bank), as collateral agent
hereunder (the "Collateral Agent"), ACXIOM CORPORATION ("Borrower") and its subsidiaries party hereto (such subsidiaries, together
with Borrower and any other Person [as hereinafter defined] who is or becomes a party to any agreement that guarantees or secures
payment and performance of the Obligations [as hereinafter defined] or any part thereof, the "Obligated Parties").

                                                               RECITALS:

         A.      Borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as the administrative agent, U.S. Bank National Association, as documentation agent,
Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and certain lenders named therein (such lenders, together with any other lender that
becomes a party to the credit agreement described in this clause A, herein the "Revolving Lenders") have entered into that certain
Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of February 5, 2003 (as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified from time to time, herein the "Revolver Agreement").

         B.       The Obligated Parties, the Collateral Agent and certain other parties are party to that certain Intercreditor
Agreement dated September 21, 2001 (as amended by that certain First Amendment to Intercreditor Agreement dated January 28, 2002 and
that certain Second Amendment to Intercreditor Agreement dated May 13, 2002, the "Original Intercreditor Agreement"). JPMorgan Chase
Bank in its capacity as "Term Lender" under the "Term Loan Agreement" and as "Letter of Credit Bank" (as such terms are defined in
the Original Intercreditor Agreement) was also party to the Original Intercreditor Agreement.  In April 2002, Borrower prepaid the
"Notes" (as defined in the Original Intercreditor Agreement) and the "Letter of Credit" (as defined in the Original Intercreditor
Agreement) was cancelled.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Borrower has prepaid the obligations outstanding under
the Term Loan Agreement and JPMorgan Chase Bank, solely in its capacity as "Term Lender" and "Letter of Credit Bank", has agreed
that it is no longer party to the Original Intercreditor Agreement and that it may be amended or otherwise modified without its
consent in such capacities only.

         C.       Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as "Synthetic Agent" (as defined in the Original Intercreditor Agreement),
and the "Holders" and "Synthetic Lenders" (as both terms are defined in the Original Intercreditor Agreement)  were also party to
the Original Intercreditor Agreement. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement:  (i) Borrower has prepaid its obligations
outstanding under the "Operative Agreements" (as defined in the Original Intercreditor Agreement) and has terminated all commitments
thereunder and (ii) the Synthetic Agent, the Holders and the Synthetic Lenders have agreed that they are no longer party to the
Original Intercreditor Agreement and that it may be amended or otherwise modified without their consent.

         D.       The Parties hereto desire to amend and restate the Original Intercreditor Agreement in order to: (i) clarify that
upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, no "Letter of Credit Obligations", "Synthetic Obligations", or "Term Obligations" (as each
is defined by the Original Intercreditor Agreement) exist and (ii) to delineate the respective rights and interests of the remaining
parties entitled to the benefits of the Original Intercreditor Agent.

                                                                2

                                                                ARTICLE II.

                                            Sharing of Collateral; Distribution of Proceeds

SECTION 2.01.     Sharing of Collateral.  The Collateral Agent shall be the secured party under the Collateral Documents and shall
hold the Collateral, all for the benefit of the Creditors.  Each Creditor shall have an undivided interest in the Collateral and
shall be entitled to its portion of any Proceeds received by Collateral Agent from any of the Collateral in accordance with this
Agreement.

SECTION 2.02.     Distribution of Proceeds by Collateral Agent. All Proceeds received by the Collateral Agent shall first be applied
as payment of the accrued and unpaid fees of the Collateral Agent hereunder and then to all other unpaid or unreimbursed Obligations
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) owing to the Collateral Agent in its capacity as Collateral Agent only.  Any
amount of such Proceeds remaining after the applications described in the preceding sentence shall be distributed:

                                                                7

(a)      First, to the Revolver Agent for application to Revolving Obligations until all the liquidated Revolving Obligations have
been satisfied in full and all contingent reimbursement obligations in respect to letters of credit issued under the Revolver
Agreement have been fully cash collateralized;

(b)      Second, to the Creditors who are owed Hedging Obligations for application to the Hedging Obligations, Pro Rata (calculated
based on the Hedging Obligations), until all the liquidated Hedging Obligations have been satisfied in full and all contingent
Hedging Obligations have been fully cash collateralized;

(c)      Third, to the Creditors who are owed Deposit Obligations for application to the Deposit Obligations, Pro Rata (calculated
based on the Deposit Obligations), until all the liquidated Deposit Obligations have been satisfied in full and all contingent
Deposit Obligations have been fully cash collateralized;

(d)      Fourth, to the Creditors for application to any other Obligation, Pro Rata (calculated based on the Obligations then
outstanding), until all of the Obligations have been satisfied in full or cash collateralized; and

(e)      Finally, after all of the Obligations have been satisfied in full or cash collateralized and all commitments and other
obligations of the Creditors to the Obligated Parties or any one of them have been terminated or otherwise satisfied, to the
Obligated Party entitled thereto or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct or as otherwise required by law.

SECTION 2.03.    Creditor Delivery of Information. If a Creditor fails to supply information relating to the outstanding Obligations
owed to it for purposes of calculating the Pro Rata portions within ten (10) Business Days after being given a written request by
the Collateral Agent, distributions hereunder shall be established by the Collateral Agent on the basis of the information available
to it and the Collateral Agent shall have no liability or responsibility for any shortfall or excess in amounts distributed on the
basis thereof.

SECTION 2.04.     Proceeds Securing Contingent Obligations. Portions of the Proceeds of the Collateral distributed to a Creditor may
thereafter be held by the Creditor as collateral for the contingent or unliquidated Obligations.  In the event that such Obligations
do not turn into liquidated Obligations and/or are otherwise finally satisfied or no longer exist, the Creditor holding the
applicable Proceeds agrees to distribute the Proceeds so held in accordance with Section 2.02.

SECTION 2.05.     Proceeds Received Directly by a Creditor.  If any Creditor receives any Proceeds after receiving a Notice of
Acceleration or as a result of the exercise of the right of set-off, banker's lien or similar right (other than pursuant to the
exercise of the right of set-off, banker's lien or similar right exercised to satisfy any Deposit Obligations) such Person shall:
(a) notify the Collateral Agent and the Revolver Agent in writing of the nature of such receipt, the date of the receipt and the
amount thereof; (b) deduct from the Proceeds received any costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the acquisition of such Proceeds; (c) hold the remaining amount of such Proceeds in trust for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent until paid over to the Collateral Agent; and (d) pay the remaining amount of such Proceeds to the Collateral Agent
promptly upon receipt thereof.  Upon receipt, the Collateral Agent shall promptly distribute the Proceeds so received in accordance
with Section 2.02.  Prior to receiving a Notice of Acceleration, any Creditor may accept and apply payments made from the Collateral
on or in respect of the Obligations to which they are a party without any responsibility to turn over or share such payments with
any other Creditor; provided that any Proceeds received at any time from or as a result of:  (i) the exercise of the right of set-
off, banker's lien or similar right (other than an exercise of such a right to satisfy Deposit Obligations) or (ii) a casualty loss

                                                                8

to or condemnation of any of the Collateral shall be turned over to the Collateral Agent and distributed in accordance with Section
2.02. After a Notice of Acceleration is sent, all such Proceeds shall be turned over to the Collateral Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.05 and shall be distributed by the Collateral Agent in accordance with Section 2.02.

SECTION 2.06.     Incorrect Distribution.  If any Creditor receives any Proceeds in an amount in excess of the amount such Person is
entitled to receive under the terms hereof, such Person shall (a) hold such excess Proceeds in trust for the benefit of the
Collateral Agent until paid over to the Collateral Agent and (b) shall promptly pay the excess amount of such Proceeds to the
Collateral Agent.  The Collateral Agent shall promptly distribute the amount so received to the Creditors entitled thereto in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.02.

SECTION 2.07.    Return of Proceeds. If at any time payment, in whole or in part, of any Proceeds distributed hereunder is rescinded
or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Collateral Agent or by any Creditor as a preference, fraudulent conveyance or
otherwise under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law, then each Person receiving any portion of such Proceeds agrees, upon
demand, to return the portion of such Proceeds it has received to the Person responsible for restoring or returning such Proceeds.

SECTION 2.08.     Notice to Persons making Distributions.  Each Creditor shall promptly and appropriately instruct any Person (other
than the Collateral Agent) making any distribution of Proceeds to make such distribution so as to give effect to this Agreement.

SECTION 2.09.     Perfection by Possession. The Collateral Agent hereby appoints each Creditor to serve as its bailee to perfect the
Collateral Agent's Liens and security interest in any Collateral, including any Proceeds, in the possession of any such Creditor
(and continues the appointments made under the Original Intercreditor Agreement).  Any Creditor possessing such Collateral agrees to
so act as bailee for the Collateral Agent in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof.

SECTION 2.10.     Non-Cash Proceeds.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, if Collateral Agent shall ever
acquire any Collateral through foreclosure or by a conveyance in lieu of foreclosure or by retaining any of the Collateral in
satisfaction of all or part of the Obligations or if any Proceeds received by Collateral Agent (or received directly by any
Creditor) to be distributed and shared pursuant to this Article II are in a form other than immediately available funds, the Person
receiving such Collateral or Proceeds shall not be required to remit any share thereof under the terms hereof and the Creditors
shall only be entitled to their undivided interests in the Collateral or non-cash Proceeds as determined hereby. The Creditors shall
receive the applicable share of any immediately available funds consisting of Proceeds from such Collateral or proceeds of such non-
cash Proceeds so acquired only if and when paid in connection with the subsequent disposition thereof. While any Collateral or other
property to be shared pursuant to this Article II is held by the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 2.10, the Collateral
Agent shall hold such Collateral or other property for the benefit of the Creditors in accordance with their undivided interest
therein and all matters relating to the management, operation, further disposition or any other aspect of such Collateral or other
property shall be resolved by the agreement of the Required Creditors subject to the restrictions in Section 7.06 hereof.

SECTION 2.11.     Subordination of Other Liens.  Subject to the rights of the Creditors created by this Agreement and the Collateral
Documents and notwithstanding any contrary terms of any Transaction Document, all Liens and other right, title and interest now or
hereafter acquired by the Collateral Agent in any or all of the Collateral (the "Collateral Agent Interests") shall be prior and
superior to any Lien, or other right, title or interest, now held or hereafter acquired by any other Creditor in and to such
property (collectively, the "Creditor Subordinate Interests") and the Creditors hereby agree that the Creditor Subordinate Interests

                                                                9

shall be subordinate to the Collateral Agent Interests.  The priority of the Collateral Agent Interests shall be applicable
irrespective of the time or order of attachment or perfection of any Lien, or other right, title or interest or the time or order of
filing of any financing statements or other documents, or any statutes, rules or law, or court decisions to the contrary.

                                                                ARTICLE III.

                                                          Rights and Remedies

SECTION 3.01.     Creditors' Rights and Remedies.  The Creditors shall have all the rights and remedies available to them under the
Transaction Documents to which they or their agent is a party or under applicable law upon the occurrence of a Potential Default or
an Event of Default or at any other time and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Creditor shall have the
independent right, exercised in accordance with the applicable Transaction Documents (other than the Collateral Documents) (and if
required by the applicable Transaction Documents, through such Creditor's agent), to do any of the following:

(a)      accelerate the Obligations owing to such Creditor pursuant to the Transaction Documents (other than the Collateral
Documents) to which such Creditor is a party;

(b)      institute suit against any Obligated Party (i) under the terms of the applicable Transaction Documents (other than the
Collateral Documents) for collection of the amounts owing thereunder or (ii) seeking an injunction, restraining order or any other
similar remedy;

(c)      seek the appointment of a receiver for any Obligated Party (but not any of the Collateral);

(d)      file an involuntary petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency laws against any Obligated Party or file a proof of claim
in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;

(e)      exercise the right of set-off; or

(f)      take any other enforcement action with respect to any Potential Default or Event of Default pursuant to and in accordance
with the Transaction Documents (other than the Collateral Documents) to which it or its agent is a party.

Without limiting the foregoing, any Creditor that is owed Deposit Obligations shall be entitled to exercise all rights of set-off,
banker's lien or other rights under the Transaction Documents (other than the Collateral Documents) relating to the Deposit
Obligations to pay and satisfy the Deposit Obligations owing to such Creditor unless the Creditor has entered into an agreement with
the Collateral Agent to the contrary.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this Section 3.01 and except as otherwise provided in
the second sentence of this Section 3.01, no Creditor may bring any action or other proceeding in respect of the Collateral or
enforce or demand enforcement of any rights with respect to the Collateral except upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.  If any Creditor obtains any payment of any Obligations owed as a result of the exercise of any right or remedy permitted
by this Section 3.01, other than from a distribution of Proceeds (except as otherwise provided in the second sentence of this
Section 3.01), such Person shall be entitled to retain the full amount thereof and shall promptly apply the amount received to the
Obligations owed to it in accordance with the Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

SECTION 3.02.     Enforcement of Security Interest.  Any Creditor which has actual knowledge of an Event of Default or Potential
Default which has not been or is not reasonably expected to be cured or waived or facts which indicate that a Potential Default or
an Event of Default which has not been or is not reasonably expected to be cured or waived has occurred, shall deliver to the

                                                                10

Collateral Agent and the other Creditors a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances thereof. A
Creditor that has accelerated, or has actual knowledge of any acceleration of any of the Obligations shall deliver to the Collateral
Agent and the other Creditors a written notice setting forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances thereof (a "Notice of
Acceleration").  Upon the receipt of a Notice of Acceleration, the Collateral Agent shall, subject to the other terms and provisions
hereof, take such steps as the Required Creditors may direct, including without limitation, steps (a) to foreclose or otherwise
enforce any Lien or security interest granted to the Collateral Agent under the Collateral Documents in accordance with the terms
thereof and (b) to exercise any and all other rights and remedies afforded to the Collateral Agent by the terms of this Agreement,
by the terms of the Collateral Documents, by the laws of the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction, by equity or otherwise.

SECTION 3.03.    Emergency Actions. The Collateral Agent is authorized, but not obligated, to take any action reasonably required to
perfect or continue the perfection of the security interests and Liens on the Collateral for the benefit of the Creditors and
following the occurrence of an Event of Default and before the Required Creditors have given the Collateral Agent directions, to
take any action which the Collateral Agent, in its sole discretion and good faith, believes to be reasonably required to promote and
protect the interests of the Creditors and to maximize both the value of the Collateral and the present value of the recovery by the
Creditors on the Obligations; provided, however, that once such directions have been received, the actions of the Collateral Agent
shall be governed thereby and the Collateral Agent shall not take any further action which would be contrary thereto. The Collateral
Agent shall give written notice of any such action to the Creditors within one Business Day and shall cease any such action upon its
receipt of written instructions from the Required Creditors.

                                                                ARTICLE IV.

                                                      Obligated Party Agreements

SECTION 4.01.     Insurance.  Borrower will, and will cause each of the other Obligated Parties to, maintain with financially sound
and reputable insurance companies insurance in such amounts (with no greater risk retention) and against such risks as are
customarily maintained by companies of established repute engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar
locations.  Borrower will furnish to the Collateral Agent, upon its request, information in reasonable detail as to the insurance so
maintained.  Each general liability insurance policy shall name the Collateral Agent as additional insured.  Each insurance policy
covering Collateral shall name the Collateral Agent as loss payee and shall provide that such policy will not be canceled or
materially changed without thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Collateral Agent.

SECTION 4.02.     Inspection and Audit Rights.  In addition to inspections pursuant to any Transaction Document, Borrower will, and
will cause each Obligated Party to permit any authorized representative designated by the Collateral Agent (acting individually or
at the request of the Required Creditors), together with any authorized representative of any Creditor desiring to accompany the
Collateral Agent, to (a) visit and inspect the properties and financial records of any Obligated Party (including those records
relating to the existence and condition of the Collateral), (b) conduct audits, appraisal and examinations of the Collateral,
(c) make extracts from such financial records, and (d) discuss the affairs, finances and condition of the Obligated Parties and the
Collateral with its officers and employees and independent public accountants.  The Collateral Agent shall also have the right to
verify with any and all customers of any Obligated Party the existence and condition of the accounts receivable, as often as the
Collateral Agent may require.

                                                                11

SECTION 4.03.     Further Assurances; Additional Assets and Subsidiaries; other Collateral Matters.  At any time and from time to
time, upon the written request of Collateral Agent, and at the expense of Borrower, each Obligated Party will promptly execute and
deliver any and all such further instruments and documentation and take such further action as the Collateral Agent deems necessary
or advisable in obtaining the full benefits of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents and of the rights, remedies and powers
herein and therein conferred or reserved, subject to the terms of the Security Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
forgoing, Borrower agrees as follows:

(a)      Additional Subsidiaries.  If any additional Domestic Subsidiary is formed or acquired after the date hereof, Borrower will:
(i) notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and (ii) promptly after such Subsidiary is formed or acquired: (A) cause such Subsidiary to
become a party to the Security Agreement pursuant to the completion and execution of a Subsidiary Joinder Agreement (as such term is
defined in the Security Agreement) and promptly take such actions to create and perfect Liens intended to be created on such
Subsidiary's personal property assets under the terms of the Security Agreement to secure the Obligations as the Collateral Agent
shall reasonably request; (B) cause such Subsidiary to grant the Collateral Agent Liens on such Subsidiary's real property assets
under the terms of a Mortgage to secure the Obligations; (C) cause such Subsidiary to execute and deliver any and all further
documentation and take such further action as the Collateral Agent deems necessary or advisable to (1) grant, perfect and protect
such Liens, (2) to evidence the authority of such Subsidiary to grant such Liens and (3) for the Collateral Agent to obtain the full
benefits of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents, but subject to the exclusions set forth in the Security Agreement; and
(D) cause the equity interests issued by such Subsidiary to be pledged pursuant to the Security Agreement by the owner thereof.
Notwithstanding the forgoing or anything in the Security Agreement to the contrary, the Borrower will not be required to cause the
Synthetic Real Estate Subsidiary to comply with the provisions of clauses (A) through (C) of this Section unless the Collateral
Agent requests when: (i) an Event of Default under clause (a) or (b) of Article VIII (payment defaults) of the Revolver Agreement
exists or (ii) an Event of Default arising as a result of the failure to comply with the covenants in Article VII (the financial
covenants) of the Revolver Agreement exists which has not been cured or waived within 30 days after the occurrence thereof.  If the
Collateral Agent makes a request under and pursuant to the permissions of the forgoing sentence, then the Borrower will, and will
cause the Synthetic Real Estate Subsidiary to, comply with the obligations under first sentence of this section and any obligations
under the Security Agreement promptly after such request is delivered with respect to all of its property which is not encumbered by
a Lien permitted by the Revolver Agreement.

(b)      Additional Assets. If any material assets (including any real property or improvements thereto or any interest therein) are
acquired by any Obligated Party after September 21, 2001 (other than:  (i) assets constituting Collateral under the Collateral
Documents that become subject to the Lien of the Collateral Documents upon acquisition thereof, (ii) assets financed with
indebtedness permitted by the Revolver Agreement, (iii) assets encumbered by other consensual Liens permitted by the Revolver
Agreement, and (iv) any Synthetic Property or any SPV Finance Documents) or if any Lien encumbering any material assets (other than
the Synthetic Property) which are not Collateral as of September 21, 2001 are released or otherwise discharged after September 21,
2001, Borrower will notify the Collateral Agent thereof, and, if requested by the Collateral Agent or the Required Creditors,
Borrower will cause such assets to be subjected to a Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent securing the Obligations and will take,
and cause the applicable other Obligated Parties to take, such actions as shall be necessary or reasonably requested by the
Collateral Agent to grant and perfect such Liens, including actions described in paragraph (a) of this Section but subject to the
exclusions set forth in the Security Agreement, all at the expense of the Obligated Parties.  The Borrower acknowledges that the fee
and leasehold interests of the Borrower in the real property and related improvements located in Faulkner County, Conway, Arkansas
which became unencumbered on or about July 3, 2002 are subject to the provisions of the forgoing sentence and the Collateral Agent
or the Required Creditors may require the Borrower to grants Liens therein at any time as long as such property is not then

                                                                12

encumbered by a Lien permitted by the Revolver Agreement.  If the Collateral Agent requests when: (i) an Event of Default under
clause (a) or (b) of Article VIII (payment defaults) of the Revolver Agreement exists or (ii) an Event of Default arising as a
result of the failure to comply with the covenants in Article VII (the financial covenants) of the Revolver Agreement exists which
has not been cured or waived within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, the Borrower will, and will cause any other Obligated
Party who has any interest in any Synthetic Property or SPV Finance Documents to, grant Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent to
secure the Obligations in all the Synthetic Property and SPV Finance Documents which are not encumbered by a Lien permitted by the
Revolver Agreement and will take, and cause the applicable other Obligated Parties to take, such actions as shall be necessary or
reasonably requested by the Collateral Agent to grant and perfect such Liens, including actions described in paragraph (a) of this
Section but subject to the exclusions set forth in the Security Agreement, all at the expense of the Obligated Parties.

(c)      Mortgaged Property.

(i)      Appraisals.  If requested by the Collateral Agent or required by applicable law, Borrower shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Collateral Agent from time to time (but not more frequently than once each calendar year) a current appraisal of
the Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof, such appraisals to be in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

(ii)     Title Insurance Commitments.  If requested by the Collateral Agent or required by applicable law, Borrower shall promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered from time to time to the Collateral Agent (but not more frequently than once each calendar year):
(i) an unconditional commitment for the issuance of a mortgagee policy of title insurance, written by a title insurance company
acceptable to Collateral Agent, and in a form satisfactory to Collateral Agent, with all requirements and conditions to the issuance
of the final policy deleted or marked satisfied, in an amount equal to not less than the fair market value of the Mortgaged Property
subject to the Lien created by the Mortgages insured thereby, committing to insuring that such Lien creates a valid first Lien on,
and security and title to, all Mortgaged Property described therein, with no exceptions which Collateral Agent shall not have
approved in writing or (ii) an update to the title insurance commitment delivered in September 2001, such update to be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Collateral Agent.

(iii)    Title Insurance Policy.  Within twenty (20) days following the request by the Collateral Agent, Borrower shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Collateral Agent a mortgagee policy of title insurance (the "Mortgage Policy"), written by a title
insurance company acceptable to Collateral Agent, and in a form satisfactory to Collateral Agent, in an amount equal to not less
than the fair market value of the Mortgaged Property, insuring that the Mortgages create a valid first Lien on, and security and

shall include an endorsement insuring against the effect of future advances under the Transaction Documents, for mechanics' liens
and for any other matter that Collateral Agent may request, and shall provide for affirmative insurance and such reinsurance as the
Collateral Agent may request.

(iv)     Environmental Reports.  If the Collateral Agent at any time has reasonable basis to believe that there may be a material
violation of any Environmental Laws by, or any material liability arising thereunder of, any Obligated Party or related to any
Mortgaged Property or any real property adjacent to any Mortgaged Property, then Borrower agrees, upon the request of the Collateral
Agent to provide the Collateral Agent with such environmental reports and assessments, engineering studies or other written material
or data as the Collateral Agent may require relating thereto.

(v)      Environmental Remediation.  In the event that the Collateral Agent determines from the environmental reports or information

adverse environmental condition is necessary with respect to any Obligated Party or the Mortgaged Property or any other property of

violation or potential violation of any Environmental Laws or any material actual or potential liability under any Environmental
Law.

SECTION 4.04.     Obligations Unimpaired.  Except as expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Agreement shall impair, as
between any Obligated Party and any Creditor, the obligation of an Obligated Party to pay or perform any Obligation it owes under
the terms of the applicable Transaction Documents or any other liability of any Obligated Party to such Creditor when the same shall
become due and payable in accordance with the terms of the applicable Transaction Documents.

SECTION 4.05.     No Additional Rights for Borrower. If any Creditor shall enforce its rights and remedies in violation of the terms
of this Agreement, each Obligated Party agrees that it shall not use such violation as a defense to the enforcement by such Creditor
of any of its rights under the Transaction Documents to which it is a party nor assert such violation as a counterclaim or basis for
set-off or recoupment against such Creditor.  In furtherance of the foregoing, each Obligated Party agrees that this Agreement shall
not give any Obligated Party any substantive or affirmative rights against any Creditor.

SECTION 4.06.     Confidentiality.  Each of the Collateral Agent, the Revolver Agent and the other Creditors agrees to maintain the
confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates'

Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such
Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or
regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the
exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any assignee of or
participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with
the consent of Borrower, or (h) to the extent such Information: (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (ii) becomes available to the Collateral Agent, any Agent or any other Creditor on a nonconfidential basis from a
source other than Borrower. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information received from Borrower relating to
Borrower or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Collateral Agent, either Agent or any other
Creditor on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by Borrower; provided that, in the case of information received from
Borrower after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person required
to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation
to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person
would accord to its own confidential information.

SECTION 4.07.     Leasing Limitations. Collateral Agent's consent shall be required in connection with any and all new leases, or in
connection with the amendment or other modification of any existing lease(s), of the real property encumbered by the Mortgages (the
"Mortgaged Property").  Notwithstanding anything contained herein or in any of the Transaction Documents to the contrary, Collateral
Agent's consent shall not be required in connection with any new lease or in connection with the amendment or other modification of
any existing lease of the Mortgaged Property, if such new lease or such existing lease following such amendment or other
modification:  (i) is on a standard form lease previously approved in writing by Collateral Agent (with only non-material
modifications thereto), (ii) covers less than 7,500 square feet, (iii) is for a term of not more than five (5) years (including all

                                                                14

the case of a new lease, provides for rental rate not less than rental rates which are being obtained by landlords in projects
similar to the Mortgaged Property in the market where such Mortgaged Property is located, and in any event, not less than the rental
rate in effect under the lease being replaced, and (v) is entered into prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default.  Borrower
shall deliver to Collateral Agent a copy of all new leases or any amendment to an existing lease within five (5) days after the
execution thereof, whether or not Collateral Agent's consent to the execution thereof is required hereunder.

                                                                ARTICLE V.

accept deposits from, act as trustee under indentures of, act as servicing bank or any similar function under any credit
relationship with, and generally engage in any kind of business with Borrower or any other Obligated Party, all as if the Collateral
Agent or such Creditor were not a party to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.  Except as set forth herein, each

HARMLESS AGAINST (TO THE EXTENT NOT REIMBURSED UNDER SECTIONS 7.01 AND 7.02 OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, BUT WITHOUT LIMITING
THE OBLIGATIONS OF BORROWER UNDER SECTIONS 7.01 AND 7.02 OR ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT), RATABLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR PRO

ACTIONS, JUDGMENTS, DEFICIENCIES, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES), AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR

NATURE WHATSOEVER WHICH MAY BE IMPOSED ON, INCURRED BY, OR ASSERTED AGAINST ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO OR ARISING
OUT OF THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR ANY ACTION TAKEN OR OMITTED TO BE TAKEN BY ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY UNDER
OR IN RESPECT OF THE COLLATERAL OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS; PROVIDED, THAT NO CREDITOR SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY PORTION OF

FOREGOING, IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENTION OF THE PARTIES HERETO THAT EACH INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER FROM AND

FEES), AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY
NEGLIGENCE OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY.  Without limiting any other provision of this Section, each Creditor agrees to reimburse the
Collateral Agent promptly upon demand for its Pro Rata portion (calculated, with respect to each Creditor by dividing the amount of
the Obligations owed to such Creditor by the total amount of the Obligations owed to all Creditors), of any and all out-of-pocket
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Collateral Agent in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings, or otherwise) of,

Collateral Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by Borrower.

SECTION 6.04.     Successor Collateral Agent.  Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Collateral Agent as provided

Borrower and the Collateral Agent may be removed at any time for any material breach of its obligations hereunder by the vote of the
Required Creditors (excluding the Collateral Agent in its individual capacities acting as a Creditor, whose Obligations shall be
excluded from the calculation of Required Creditors for this purpose). Upon any such resignation or removal, Required Creditors will

Creditors and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Collateral Agent's giving of notice of
resignation or the Required Creditors' removal of the retiring Collateral Agent, then the retiring Collateral Agent may, on behalf

the proposed disposition is not permitted under the terms of the Transaction Documents. To the extent the  Collateral Agent is
required to execute any release documents in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence (and clause (a) above), the
Collateral Agent shall do so promptly upon request of the Borrower. If the sale or other disposition of Collateral is not permitted
under or pursuant to the Transaction Documents, the Liens encumbering the Collateral may only be released with the consent of the
Collateral Agent and the Revolver Agent (at the direction of the Revolving Lenders). Beginning with the fiscal quarter ended

Revolver Agreement if: (i) a financial officer of the Borrower provides a written certification that such property has been financed
in a transaction permitted by all the Transaction Documents and (ii) the release is required in connection with such financing.

THIS SECTION SHALL BE INDEMNIFIED FROM OR HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ANY LOSSES, LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS,
COSTS AND EXPENSES ARISING OUT OF RESULTING FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE PERSON TO BE INDEMNIFIED. WITHOUT

INDEMNIFIED HEREUNDER FROM AND HELD HARMLESS AGAINST ALL OF SUCH LIABILITIES, OBLIGATIONS, LOSSES, DAMAGES, PENALTIES, ACTIONS,
JUDGMENTS, DEFICIENCIES, SUITS, COSTS, EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS' FEES), AND DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM THE SOLE OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY TO BE INDEMNIFIED
HEREUNDER.

SECTION 7.03.     Limitation of Liability. Neither the Collateral Agent nor any Affiliate, officer, director, employee, attorney, or
agent thereof shall have any liability with respect to, and each Obligated Party and each Creditor hereby waives, releases, and
agrees not to sue any of them upon, any claim for any special, indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages suffered or

cumulative and not exclusive of any rights and remedies provided by law.

SECTION 7.05.     Successors and Assigns. The Revolver Agent represents and warrants that it has the authority to bind the Revolving
Lenders to the terms and provisions of this Agreement. By accepting the benefits hereof and of the Collateral, the Creditors who are

Collateral Agent, the Creditors, each Obligated Party and their respective successors and assigns, including any assignees permitted
under the terms of the Transaction Documents.  No Obligated Party may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Collateral Agent and all of the Creditors.

SECTION 7.06.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT; AMENDMENT. This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the
Original Intercreditor Agreement.  The Obligated Parties and the Creditors ratify and confirm the Original Intercreditor Agreement
and for all matters arising prior to the effective date of this Agreement (including, without limitation, matters relating to

THE OBLIGATIONS OF BORROWER OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATED PARTY UNDER SUCH TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS) AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY
EVIDENCE OF PRIOR, CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO. THERE ARE NO ORAL AGREEMENTS
AMONG THE PARTIES THERETO. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Collateral Documents, nor any consent to
