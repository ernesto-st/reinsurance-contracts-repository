This Amendment is a Loan Document.    (b) The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Amendment shall not,  except as expressly provided herein, operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of any  Lender or the Administrative Agent under any of the Loan Documents, nor constitute a waiver of  any provision of any of the Loan Documents.    (c) In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Amendment and the  terms of the Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents, the terms hereof shall control.    5.

The Administrative  Agent shall endeavor in good-faith to replace the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions  with valid provisions, the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the  invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions.            </FONT></DIV>

(a) Not later than 1:00 p.m., New York time, on each Revaluation Date, the  Administrative Agent shall (x) determine the Exchange Rate as of such Revaluation Date with  respect to each applicable Alternative Currency and (y) give notice thereof to each applicable  Issuing Bank and the Company. The Exchange Rates so determined shall become effective (i) in  the case of the initial Revaluation Date, on the Effective Date and (ii) in the case of each  subsequent Revaluation Date, on the first Business Day immediately following such Revaluation  Date (a &#8220;Reset Date&#8221;), shall remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date, and shall for  all purposes of this Agreement (other than any provision expressly requiring the use of a current  exchange rate) be the Exchange Rates employed in converting any amounts between dollars and  any Alternative Currency.

SECTION 1.07. Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection  with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a  different jurisdiction&#8217;s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes  the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been  transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes  into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized and acquired on the first  date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.    SECTION 1.08. Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification. The interest rate on a Loan  denominated in dollars or an Alternative Currency may be derived from an interest rate  benchmark that is, or may in the future become, the subject of regulatory reform. Regulators  have signaled the need to use alternative benchmark reference rates for some of these interest  rate benchmarks and, as a result, such interest rate benchmarks may cease to comply with  applicable laws and regulations, may be permanently discontinued, and/or the basis on which  they are calculated may change. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the  rate at which contributing banks may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the  London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that,  after the end of 2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate  submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE  Benchmark Administrator, the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank  offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London interbank offered  rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon  which to determine the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public  and private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or alternative  reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. Upon the occurrence of  a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event, a Term ESTR Transition Event  or an Early Opt-In Election, Sections 2.14(b) and 2.14(c) provide a mechanism for determining  an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Company,  pursuant to Section 2.14(e), of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest rate on  Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept  any responsibility for, and shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration,  submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the  definition of &#8220;LIBO Rate&#8221; (or &#8220;EURIBOR Rate&#8221;, as applicable) or with respect to any alternative  or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation, (i) any such  alternative, successor or replacement rate implemented pursuant to Sections 2.14(b) or 2.14(c),  whether upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event, a Term SOFR Transition Event,  a Term ESTR Transition Event or an Early Opt-In Election and (ii) the implementation of any  </FONT></DIV>

The Borrowers&#8217; obligations to reimburse LC  Disbursements as provided in paragraph (e) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and  irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under  any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability  of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision thereof or hereof, (ii) any  draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or  invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii)  payment by an Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other  document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit or (iv) any other event or  circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the  provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff  against, a Borrower&#8217;s obligations hereunder.

In such event, if  a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the  Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agrees to pay to  the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon,  for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the such Borrower to  but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender,  (A) in the case of Loans denominated in dollars, the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate  determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank  compensation and (B) in the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the rate  determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount (which  determination will be conclusive absent manifest error) or (ii) in the case of the Borrowers, the  interest rate applicable to (A) in the case of Loans denominated in dollars, ABR Loans and (B) in  the case of Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the interest rate applicable to the  subject Loan pursuant to Section 2.13.

If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent,  then such amount shall constitute such Lender&#8217;s Loan included in such Borrowing.    SECTION 2.07. Interest Elections.    (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the  applicable Borrowing Request or designated by Section 2.03 and, in the case of a Eurocurrency  Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or  designated by Section 2.03. Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to convert such  Borrowing to a Borrowing of a different Type (provided that Eurocurrency Borrowings  denominated in an Alternative Currency may not be converted into ABR Borrowings) or to  continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurocurrency Borrowing, may elect Interest  Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Company may elect different options with  respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be  allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the  Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.    (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the applicable Borrower shall notify  the Administrative Agent of such election by the time that a Borrowing Request would be  required under Section 2.03 if the Company was requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type  resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest  Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be signed by a Responsible Officer of such  Borrower.  </FONT></DIV>

Such indemnifying party, upon the  request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over  pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant  Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such  refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  paragraph, in no event will any indemnified party be required to pay any amount to any  indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place such  indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such indemnified party would  have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been  deducted or withheld and the indemnification payments or additional amounts in respect of such  Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party  to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems  confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.    (h) Each party&#8217;s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the resignation or  replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a  Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all  Loan Document Obligations.    (i) VAT    (i) All amounts expressed to be payable under a Loan Document by any party  to a Credit Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply  for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that  supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (ii) below, if VAT is or becomes  chargeable on any supply made by any Credit Party to any party under a Loan Document  and such Credit Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT,  </FONT></DIV>

The Recipient must (where this paragraph (A) applies)  promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment  the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient  reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and    (B) (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the  relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following  demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT  chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably  determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax  authority in respect of that VAT.    (iii) Where a Loan Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify a  Credit Party for any cost or expense, that party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case  may be) such Credit Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part  thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Credit Party reasonably  determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the  relevant tax authority.    (iv) Any reference in this clause Section 2.17(i) to any party shall, at any time  when such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where  appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative  member of such group at such time (the term &#8220;representative member&#8221; to have the same  meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).    (v) In relation to any supply made by a Credit Party to any party under a Loan  Document, if reasonably requested by such Credit Party, that party must promptly  provide such Credit Party with details of that party&#8217;s VAT registration and such other  information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Credit Party&#8217;s VAT  reporting requirements in relation to such supply.    (j) For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term &#8220;Lender&#8221; includes any Issuing Bank  and the term &#8220;applicable law&#8221; includes FATCA.  </FONT></DIV>

Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative  Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of  calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to such account or accounts as  may be specified by the Administrative Agent, except that payments required to be made directly  to any Issuing Bank shall be so made, payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03  shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan  Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein.

All payments hereunder of  principal or interest in respect of any Loan or LC Disbursement shall, except as otherwise  expressly provided herein, be made in the currency of such Loan or LC Disbursement; all other  payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

(a) Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the entity  named as Administrative Agent in the heading of this Agreement and its successors to serve as  administrative agent and collateral agent (without prejudice to the right of the Administrative  Agent to designate any sub-agent, co-agent or trustee to serve as collateral agent or security  trustee) under the Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions  and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms of the  Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. In  addition, to the extent required under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of  America, each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby grants to the Administrative Agent  (including any sub-agent, co-agent or trustee designated by the Administrative Agent) any  required powers of attorney to execute any Security Document governed by the laws of such  jurisdiction on such Lender&#8217;s or such Issuing Bank&#8217;s behalf. It is understood and agreed that the  use of the term &#8220;agent&#8221; (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with  reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary duty or other  implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead,  such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an  administrative relationship between contracting parties.    (b) The Person serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same  rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or an Issuing Bank as any other Lender or Issuing  Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such  Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the  financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of  business with the Borrowers or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were  not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders  or the Issuing Banks.    (c) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those  expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in  nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) the Administrative Agent shall not  be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred  and is continuing, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary  action or to exercise any discretionary power, except discretionary rights and powers expressly  contemplated by the Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise as  directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders  as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary,  under the circumstances as provided in the Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative  Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion, could expose the  Administrative Agent to liability or be contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document  or applicable law, and (iii) except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the  Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to  </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for  any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or  such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Administrative  Agent shall believe in good faith to be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in the  Loan Documents) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct (such  absence to be presumed unless otherwise determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a  final and nonappealable judgment). The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have  knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof (stating that it is a &#8220;notice of  default&#8221;) is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrowers, a Lender or an Issuing Bank,  and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire  into (A) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement  or any other Loan Document, (B) the contents of any certificate, report or other document  delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (C) the performance or  observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth in this  Agreement or any other Loan Document or the occurrence of any Default, (D) the sufficiency,  validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other Loan  Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (E) the satisfaction of any  condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in this Agreement or any other Loan Document,  other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative  Agent or satisfaction of any condition that expressly refers to the matters described therein being  acceptable or satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the  contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for, or be responsible for any loss, cost or  expense suffered by the Borrowers or any Lender as a result of, any determination of the  Revolving Exposure or the component amounts thereof.    (d) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability  for relying, upon any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or  other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other  distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent or otherwise  authenticated by the proper Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements  set forth in the Loan Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof). The  Administrative Agent also shall be entitled to rely, and shall not incur any liability for relying,  upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper  Person (whether or not such Person in fact meets the requirements set forth in the Loan  Documents for being the signatory, sender or authenticator thereof), and may act upon any such  statement prior to receipt of written confirmation thereof. In determining compliance with any  condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a  Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuing  Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender  or such Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary  from such Lender or such Issuing Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such  Letter of Credit. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel  for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be  </FONT></DIV>

The Administrative Agent  and any such sub-agent may perform any of and all their duties and exercise their rights and  powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article  shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any  such sub-agent and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of  the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The  Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agent,  co-agent or trustee except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a  final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or  willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.    (f) Subject to the terms of this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any  time from its capacity as such. In connection with such resignation, the Administrative Agent  shall give notice of its intent to resign to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrowers.  Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with  the consent of the Borrowers (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a  successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have  accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of  its intent to resign, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the  Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in  New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment  as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become  vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and  the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder  and under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor  Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise  agreed by the Borrowers and such successor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event no  successor Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed and shall have accepted such  appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its intent to  resign, the retiring Administrative Agent may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to  the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrowers, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of  such resignation stated in such notice, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged  from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; provided that,  solely for purposes of maintaining any security interest granted to the Collateral Agent under any  Security Document for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the retiring Administrative Agent (or  any applicable sub-agent or security trustee) shall continue to be vested with such security  interest as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties and, in the case of any Collateral  in the possession of the Administrative Agent (or such sub-agent or security trustee), shall  continue to hold such Collateral, in each case until such time as a successor Administrative  Agent is appointed and accepts such appointment in accordance with this paragraph (it being  understood and agreed that the retiring Administrative Agent shall have no duty or obligation to  </FONT></DIV>

Following the  effectiveness of the Administrative Agent&#8217;s resignation from its capacity as such, the provisions  of this Article and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification  provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such  retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of  any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative  Agent and in respect of the matters referred to in the proviso under clause (a) above.    (g) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and  without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other Lender or Issuing  Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and  information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into  this Agreement. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will,  independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers or any other  Lender or Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such  documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its  own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan  Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

The Lenders, each Issuing Bank and each other Secured  Party irrevocably (i) authorizes the Administrative Agent to enter into or amend any Secured  SCF Intercreditor Agreement with any representative of the holders of Secured SCF Obligations  that are permitted to be secured by a Lien on the Collateral as permitted under this Agreement, in  each case for the purpose of adding the holders of such Indebtedness (or their representative) as a  party thereto and otherwise causing such Indebtedness to be subject thereto and (ii) and consents  to the Administrative Agent and agrees not to assert any claims against the Administrative Agent  or any successor thereof arising from the role of the Administrative Agent or such successor  under such Secured SCF Intercreditor Agreement, so long as it is acting in accordance with the  terms of the Loan Documents and such Secured SCF Intercreditor Agreement (it being  understood that any action taken by the Administrative Agent acting at the direction of, or with  the negative consent of, the Required Lenders shall be an action that is undertaken in accordance  with the terms of the Loan Documents).

(i) Except with respect to the exercise of setoff rights of any Lender in accordance  with Section 9.08 or with respect to a Lender&#8217;s right to file a proof of claim in an insolvency  proceeding, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the  Collateral or to enforce any Guarantee of the Obligations, it being understood and agreed that all  powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the  Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent, co-agent or trustee designated by it as collateral agent or  security trustee) on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms thereof. In the  event of a foreclosure by the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent(s) designated by it as  collateral agent or security trustee) on any of the Collateral pursuant to a public or private sale or  other disposition, the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be the purchaser or licensor of  any or all of such Collateral at any such sale or other disposition, and the Administrative Agent  (or any sub-agent, co-agent or trustee designated by it as collateral agent or security trustee), as  agent for and representative of the Secured Parties (but not any Lender or Lenders in its or their  respective individual capacities unless the Required Lenders shall otherwise agree in writing)  shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase  price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of  the Loan Document Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price for any collateral  payable by the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent, co-agent or trustee designated by it as  collateral agent or security trustee) on behalf of the Secured Parties at such sale or other  disposition.    (j) The Secured Cash Management Obligations, the Secured Hedging Obligations,  the Secured LC Facility Obligations and the Secured SCF Obligations, shall be secured and  guaranteed pursuant to the Loan Documents only to the extent that, and for so long as, the other  Obligations are so secured and guaranteed. No person shall have any voting rights under any  Loan Document solely as a result of the existence of Secured Cash Management Obligations,  Secured Hedging Obligations, Secured LC Facility Obligations or Secured SCF Obligations  owed to it. For the avoidance of doubt, no release of Collateral or Guarantors effected in the  manner permitted by this Agreement shall require the consent of any holder of Secured Cash  Management Obligations, Secured Hedging Obligations, Secured LC Facility Obligations or  Secured SCF Obligations. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that is  a provider of Cash Management Services or a party to any Hedging Agreement, Secured LC  Facility or Secured Supply Chain Financing shall be deemed to have appointed the  Administrative Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent (without prejudice to  the Administrative Agent&#8217;s right to designate any sub-agent, co-agent or trustee as collateral  agent or security trustee) under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound by the Loan  Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph.

(b) Except as provided in Sections 2.14(b), (c) and (d), none of this Agreement, any  other Loan Document or any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified  except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered  into by the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders and, in the case of  any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the  Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case  with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) increase the  Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal  amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees  payable hereunder, in each case without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby  (provided that the consent of the Required Lenders shall be sufficient to waive or reduce the  increased portion of interest resulting from Section 2.13(cd)), (iii) postpone the scheduled  maturity date of any Loan or the required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any  date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or  excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment,  without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change any of the provisions of  this Section, change any provision of Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro  rata sharing of payments required thereby or the percentage set forth in the definition of the term  &#8220;Required Lenders&#8221; or any other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document  </FONT></DIV>

The Borrowers agree that they will not assert any claim against any Credit Party based on an  alleged breach of fiduciary duty by such Credit Party in connection with this Agreement and the  transactions contemplated hereby.
