          Section 3.03.    PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION.

                  (a)      Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser and the Sellers
shall agree upon the allocation of the Consideration (and all other items
properly included in "consideration," as described in Treasury Regulation
section 1.1060-1(c)(1)), in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code
and the rules and regulations thereunder (the "ALLOCATION"). The Allocation
shall be adjusted as necessary to reflect any adjustments to the Consideration
after the Closing Date. The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to use such
allocation in filing all required forms under Section 1060 of the Code (or any
comparable forms under state or foreign law), and all other Tax Returns, and the
Purchaser and the Sellers further agree that they shall not take any position
inconsistent with such allocation upon any examination of any such Tax Return,
in any refund claim or in any tax litigation. Not later than 30 days prior to
the filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating to this transaction, each
party shall deliver to the other party a copy of its Form 8594.

                  (b)      The Purchaser and the Sellers further agree that the
payment of the Consideration to Sellers contemplated by Section 3.02 may be made
to a single Seller that is designated by Polaroid in writing as being authorized
to act as agent for all of the Sellers, whereupon each Seller shall be deemed to
have received the Consideration allocable to the Acquired Assets owned by such
Seller in accordance with the allocation determination under this Section 3.03,
provided that any Taxes that arise as a result of the payment being made to a
single Seller shall be Excluded Liabilities.

                  (c)      The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that, in the
event that the Acquired Assets to be transferred pursuant to this Agreement
ultimately are transferred pursuant to more than one separate agreement between
the Purchaser and/or its designated Affiliate and the Sellers, the Purchaser
and/or its designated Affiliate and the Sellers will treat the transfers under
all such agreements as a series of related transactions within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations section 1.1060-1(b)(5), and such transfers shall therefore
be treated as the transfer of a single trade or business, as described in
Section 1060 of the Code and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Purchaser
and the Sellers shall aggregate the amounts paid under all such agreements and
allocate that aggregate amount among all assets acquired under all such
agreements as if all such transactions had been consummated pursuant to a single
purchase and sale transaction, resulting in a single Form 8594 being filed for
the Contemplated Transactions.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS

     Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule, the Sellers jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Purchaser on and as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date as follows:

          Section 4.01.    ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.

                  (a)      Each Polaroid Entity is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or
other organizational power and, subject to Bankruptcy Court

                                     - 23 -
<Page>

approval, authority to own, use, lease and operate its properties and assets as
now owned, used, leased and operated and to carry on its business as and where
presently being conducted, and is qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in every jurisdiction where the nature of the business conducted
by it or the properties owned, leased or operated by it requires qualification
or licensure, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b)      Except as set forth on Section 4.01(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no direct or indirect Subsidiaries of Polaroid
other than the other Sellers and the Acquired Subsidiaries. Except as set forth
on Section 4.01(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, Sellers own all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock and other Equity Interests of each Acquired
Subsidiary. There are no other shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests
of any Acquired Subsidiary issued other than as set forth on Section 4.01(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule and there are no declared and unpaid dividends or
distributions on any such capital stock or other Equity Interests. The Acquired
Stock (i) has been duly authorized, validly issued, and is fully paid and
nonassessable (in those jurisdictions in which such concepts are applicable),
(ii) has not been issued in violation of any preemptive rights of stockholders
or of any terms of any agreement or other understanding binding upon any
Polaroid Entity, and (iii) has been offered and sold in compliance with any and
all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Except for directors'
qualifying shares and shares held by other Polaroid appointees required to be
issued to comply with local government regulations, all of the outstanding
capital stock and other Equity Interests of the Foreign Subsidiaries are owned
beneficially and of record (directly or indirectly) by Polaroid free and clear
of any and all Encumbrances. Except as set forth in Section 4.01(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there is no security, option, warrant, right, call,
subscription agreement, commitment or understanding of any nature whatsoever to
which any of the Polaroid Entities is a party or by which it is bound, that (i)
calls for the issuance, sale, pledge or other disposition of any Equity
Interests of the Foreign Subsidiaries or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for, or other rights to acquire, any Equity Interests of the
Foreign Subsidiaries, (ii) obligates any Polaroid Entity to grant, offer or
enter into any of the foregoing or to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any capital stock or other Equity Interests of the Foreign Subsidiaries or (iii)
relates to the transfer, dividends rights, voting, control, or registration
rights of such Equity Interests or rights. Upon the Closing, Purchaser or its
designee will be the sole owner of all right, title and interest in the Equity
Interests of the Acquired Subsidiaries.

          Section 4.02.    AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. Each Seller has
the corporate or other organizational power and authority to enter into and
deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and, subject to Bankruptcy
Court approval, to carry out its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The
execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements by each of the Sellers party thereto and the consummation by each of
the Sellers of the Contemplated Transactions have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate or other organizational actions. Subject to the entry and
effectiveness of the Sale Procedures Order and the Approval Order, this
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by or on behalf of
each of the Sellers and (assuming this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser) constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Sellers, enforceable against the Sellers in accordance with its terms, and
the Ancillary Agreements will be, when executed and delivered by the Sellers
parties thereto, the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Sellers parties
thereto, enforceable against

                                     - 24 -
<Page>

the Sellers parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms, in each
case subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium,
and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally from time to time in effect
and to general equitable principles.

          Section 4.03.    GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. No consent,
approval, authorization of, declaration, filing, or registration with, any
domestic or foreign government or regulatory authority, is required to be made
or obtained by any of the Sellers in connection with the execution, delivery,
and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, except for: (a) consents,
approvals, authorizations of, declarations, or filings with, the Bankruptcy
Court, (b) the filing of a notification and report form under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
ACT"), and the expiration or earlier termination of the applicable waiting
period thereunder, (c) the filing of required notifications under applicable
foreign antitrust laws and regulations and the receipt of any necessary
approvals thereunder, and (d) consents, approvals, authorizations, declarations,
filings and registrations the lack of which would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. The items referred to in clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 4.03
are hereinafter referred to as the "GOVERNMENTAL REQUIREMENTS."

          Section 4.04.    NO VIOLATIONS. Assuming that the Governmental
Requirements will be satisfied, made, or obtained and will remain in full force
and effect, and assuming receipt of the consents, approvals and authorizations
listed in Section 4.04 of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution,
delivery, or performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the
Sellers parties thereto, nor the consummation by any Seller of the Contemplated
Transactions, nor compliance by any Seller with any of the provisions hereof and
of the Ancillary Agreements, will (a) result in any breach of any provisions of
the articles of incorporation or bylaws or similar organizational documents of
any Polaroid Entity, (b) result in a violation, or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time) a default (or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, amendment, vesting, payment, exercise,
acceleration, suspension, or revocation) under any of the terms, conditions, or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, deed of trust, security interest,
indenture, loan or credit agreement, license, permit, contract, lease,
agreement, plan, or other instrument, commitment or obligation to which any
Polaroid Entity is a party or by which such Polaroid Entity's properties or
assets may be bound or affected, (c) violate any order, writ, governmental
authorization, injunction, decree, statute, rule, or regulation applicable to
any Polaroid Entity or to any properties or assets of any Polaroid Entity, or
(d) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance other than Permitted
Encumbrances on any asset of a Polaroid Entity, except in the case of clauses
(b) and (d) above, for violations, breaches, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations, creations, impositions, suspensions, or
revocations that (i) would not individually or in the aggregate have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) are excused by or unenforceable as a result of the filing
of the Petitions or the applicability of any provision of or any applicable law
of the Bankruptcy Code.

          Section 4.05.    CONTRACTS; COMPLIANCE. True and complete copies of
all material Contracts relating to the Business have been made available to
Purchaser. Each of the Contracts relating to the Business is valid, binding and,
subject to payment of all cure amounts payable to effectuate, pursuant to the
Bankruptcy Code, the assumption by and assignment to the Purchaser of such
Contracts under the Approval Order, if applicable, enforceable against the
Polaroid Entity party thereto and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, the other parties
thereto, in accordance with

                                     - 25 -
<Page>

its terms and is in full force and effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.05
of the Disclosure Schedule and other than with respect to monetary defaults by
the Sellers under Contracts that are curable by payment of all cure amounts
payable to effectuate, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the assumption by and
assignment to the Purchaser of such Contracts under the Approval Order, if
applicable, the Polaroid Entities party thereto and, to the Sellers' Knowledge,
each of the other parties thereto, have performed all obligations required to be
performed by them under, and are not in default in respect of, any of such
Contracts, and no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute such a default, other than where the failure to perform
such obligations or such default would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Section 4.05 of the Disclosure Schedule and other than with respect to monetary
defaults by the Sellers under Contracts that are curable by payment of all cure
amounts payable to effectuate, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, the assumption
by and assignment to the Purchaser of such Contracts under the Approval Order,
if applicable, to the Sellers' Knowledge, Sellers have received no claim or
notice from any other party to any such Contract that any Polaroid Entity has
breached any obligations to be performed by it thereunder, or is otherwise in
default or delinquent in performance thereunder, where the consequence of such
breach or default would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Section 4.05 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all Post-Petition
Contracts of the Sellers relating to the Business other than immaterial
Post-Petition Contracts and open purchase orders entered into in the Ordinary
Course of Business. Except as set forth on Section 4.05 of the Disclosure
Schedule and except for Post-Petition Contracts that are immaterial to the
Business, none of the Post-Petition Contracts contains any provisions
restricting its assignment to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

          Section 4.06.    ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

                  (a)      All of the Accounts Receivable of the Business
reflected on the Audited Financial Statement for the year ended December 31,
2001 (the "2001 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENT") or acquired after the date thereof
and on or before the Closing Date represent amounts receivable for products
actually delivered or services actually provided, and have arisen from bona fide
transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business. All Accounts Receivable of the
Business reflected on the 2001 Audited Financial Statement or acquired after the
date thereof and on or before the Closing Date are accurately reflected on the
books of the Business and have arisen from bona fide transactions. The reserve
on the 2001 Audited Financial Statement for doubtful accounts is adequate in
accordance with GAAP.

                  (b)      All of the Accounts Payable and all payables and
other accruals of the Business reflected on the 2001 Audited Financial Statement
or which have arisen after the date thereof and on or before the Closing Date
are accurately reflected on the books of the Business and have arisen from bona
fide transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business.

          Section 4.07.    INVENTORY. The raw materials and works-in-process are
useable in the Ordinary Course of Business in the production or completion of
the finished goods included in the Acquired Assets. All of the raw materials and
works-in-process can reasonably be expected to be consumed (other than with
respect to scrappage consistent with past practice of the Business) in the
Ordinary Course of Business within a reasonable period of time, and the finished
goods included in the Acquired Assets are fit for the ordinary purposes, or if
applicable,

                                     - 26 -
<Page>

the particular purposes, for which such finished goods are used and are saleable
in the Ordinary Course of Business. All Inventory of the Polaroid Entities
relating to the Business and reflected on the 2001 Audited Financial Statement
or acquired by the Polaroid Entities thereafter and on or before the Closing
Date is carried on Sellers' books and records relating to the Business at not in
excess of the lower of historical cost or market price determined in accordance
with GAAP. Sellers have provided for adequate reserves in accordance with GAAP
with respect to slow moving, damaged and obsolete Inventory.

          Section 4.08.    ALL ASSETS. Except for the Excluded Assets, the
Acquired Assets include all assets and properties of Sellers which are primarily
related to, or otherwise material to the conduct of, the Business. To Sellers'
Knowledge, no additional assets other than those included in the Acquired Assets
are necessary in order to operate the Business.

          Section 4.09.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The books of account and
related records of each Polaroid Entity for the Business fairly reflect in
reasonable detail all assets, liabilities and transactions relating to the
Business in accordance with GAAP. Polaroid has delivered to the Purchaser true,
correct and complete copies of the audited consolidated financial statements of
Polaroid as of and for the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2001, December
31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, each together with a report thereon by the
Sellers' Auditors (the "AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). Attached hereto as
Section 4.09 of the Disclosure Schedule are the unaudited historical balance
sheet of the Business as of June 2, 2002 and the unaudited historical statements
of results of operations and cash flows of the Business for the five-month
period ended June 2, 2002 (collectively, the "INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS" and
together with the Audited Financial Statements, the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). The
Financial Statements were compiled from each Polaroid Entity's books and records
for the Business, are in accordance with such books and records, present fairly
in all material respects the financial position of Polaroid and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, their results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (except, in the case of the Interim Financial
Statements, in respect of normal and recurring year end adjustments, none of
which is material in amount), and the assets and liabilities of the Business as
of the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout
the period. Except for (a) Liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business after the Determination Date; (b) Liabilities disclosed, reflected or
provided for in the Financial Statements; (c) Liabilities disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule and (d) Liabilities incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, from the Determination Date, no Polaroid
Entity has incurred any Liabilities that would both (i) be required to be
reflected or provided for in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP
and the policies, procedures and methods used to prepare the Financial
Statements and (ii) be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

          Section 4.10.    RELATIONSHIP WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS.
Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and correct list
of the twenty (20) largest customers (by net sales) and twenty (20) largest
suppliers (by dollar volume) of the Polaroid Entities for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2001 and for the two-month period ended March 3, 2002. To Sellers'
Knowledge, no such customer or supplier listed on Section 4.10 of the Disclosure
Schedule, or any customer who is the sole purchaser of a product or any supplier
who is the sole source of any supplies, intends to terminate or adversely and
materially modify its business relationship with any Polaroid Entity.

compensation payable or to become payable to Employees outside the Ordinary
Course of Business, or any advance (excluding advances for ordinary business
expenses) or loan to, any Employee or any increase in, or any addition to, other
benefits (including any bonus, profit-sharing, pension or other plan) to which
any of the Employees may be entitled, or any payments to any pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, bonus or similar plan except payments in the
Ordinary Course of Business made pursuant to the benefit plans described in

or on behalf of any Employee other than payment of base compensation and
reimbursement for reasonable expenses in the Ordinary Course of Business;

                  (c)      any damage, destruction or loss affecting the
Business in excess of $500,000, whether or not covered by insurance;

Knowledge, any disposition of or failure to keep in effect any rights in, to or
for the use of any Trade Secrets relating to the Business;

of any kind (other than Permitted Encumbrances) of any assets, tangible or
intangible, of the Business;

                  (i)      any making or authorization of any single capital
expenditure in excess of $500,000, or capital expenditures in excess of

Entity's credit, collection and payment policies, procedures and general
practices with respect to the collection of Accounts Receivable and the payment
of Accounts Payable.

there is no suit, action, proceeding, or investigation (whether at law or
equity, before or by any federal, state, or foreign commission, court, tribunal,
board, agency, or instrumentality, or before any arbitrator) pending or, to any
of the Sellers' Knowledge, threatened against or affecting any Polaroid Entity,
the outcome of which would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule, or order of
any court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality, or
arbitrator outstanding against any Polaroid Entity that would have a Material
Adverse Effect.

          Section 4.13.    NO DEFAULT. No Acquired Subsidiary is in violation,

other organizational documents, (b) any note, bond, mortgage, deed of trust,
security interest, indenture, loan or credit agreement, license, permit,

                  (a)      Except as set forth in Section 4.14 of the Disclosure
Schedule, the Polaroid Entities possess and are in compliance with all Permits
(other than Environmental Permits which are governed by Section 4.15) required
in connection with the conduct of the Business under all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and ordinances, the failure of which to obtain or hold would be

Entities have conducted the Business and are currently doing so in compliance
with all Applicable Law relating to the Business, except for such violations
which would not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except

result of the commencement or pendency of the Case or the application of any
provision of the Bankruptcy Code, no Polaroid Entity is in violation of, or has

equity, before or by any federal, state, or foreign commission, court, tribunal,
board, agency, or instrumentality, or before any arbitrator) pending or, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened against or affecting the Purchaser which
could reasonably be expected to result in the issuance of a judgment, decree,
injunction, rule, or order of any court, governmental department, commission,
agency, instrumentality, or arbitrator outstanding restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Purchaser from consummating the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

          Section 5.06.    FINANCING. The Purchaser has delivered to Polaroid a
true and correct copy of a commitment letter (the "EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER")

funds to pay the Cash Consideration and to consummate the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement.

          Section 5.07.    BROKERS. Except for One Equity Partners LLC, the fees
related to which shall be borne by the Purchaser, no person is entitled to any

events set forth in Section 4.11 hereof; and

                  (j)      no entity so bound shall agree or commit to do any of

shall afford to the Purchaser and to the Purchaser's Representatives and
financing sources reasonable access without material disruption to the Business
throughout the period prior to the Closing Date to all its books, documents,

each report, schedule, and other document filed or received by them pursuant to
the requirements of federal or state securities laws and (b) all other
information as the Purchaser reasonably may request in furtherance of the
Contemplated Transactions. Each of the Polaroid Entities shall permit the

          Section 6.03.    FILINGS; OTHER ACTIONS. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, as promptly as practicable, the Sellers and the
Purchaser shall (a) promptly make all filings and submissions under the HSR Act,

which filings are required to be made prior to the Closing Date with, and which
material consents, approvals, permits, or authorizations are required to be
obtained prior to the Closing Date from, governmental or regulatory authorities
of the United States and foreign jurisdictions in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions; provided, however, that the Purchaser and the Sellers agree that
neither of them will make any voluntary filing under applicable foreign
antitrust laws or regulations unless advised by legal counsel in such
jurisdiction that the failure to make a filing could result in a Material
Adverse Effect or otherwise be in violation of Applicable Law, and (ii) timely
making all such filings and timely seeking all such material consents,
approvals, permits, or authorizations, and (c) use all reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all other action and do, or cause to be done, all
other things reasonably necessary or

                                     - 42 -
<Page>

appropriate to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, as soon as practicable.
In connection with the foregoing, the Sellers will promptly provide the
Purchaser, and the Purchaser will promptly provide the Sellers, with copies of
all correspondence, filings, or communications (or memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and any governmental agency or authority or members of their respective
staffs, on the other hand, with respect to all filings and submissions required
hereunder.

          Section 6.04.    PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Purchaser and the Sellers
agree that they will not make any public announcement, issue any press release
or respond in writing to any press inquiry with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions without the prior approval of the Purchaser and
Polaroid (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be
required by Applicable Law, the Bankruptcy Court or any requirement of any stock
exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the stock of either party is
listed or quoted. Following the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser and
Polaroid shall issue a joint press release or separate press releases announcing
the Contemplated Transactions, which press release or releases shall be approved
by the Purchaser and Polaroid prior to release. From and after the Closing,
Sellers will keep confidential and cause their Affiliates to keep confidential
all information relating to the Business and the Acquired Assets, except as
specifically and only to the extent required by applicable law or administrative
or legal process; it being understood that: (a) Sellers will notify Purchaser in
writing at least five days (to the extent possible) prior to any proposed
disclosure of such nonpublic information in order to enable Purchaser to seek an
appropriate protective order; and (b) Sellers shall not be required to keep
confidential and may disclose any information which (i) is or becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a disclosure by Sellers in breach of this
Agreement, (ii) was known to the party receiving such information prior to the
receipt thereof other than as a result of a disclosure by Sellers in breach of
this Agreement, or (iii) was previously independently developed by the party
receiving such information without the assistance of Sellers.

          Section 6.05.    ACQUIRED ASSETS. Amounts received by Sellers on or
after the Closing Date in respect of any Acquired Assets shall be paid over to
Purchaser promptly upon receipt by Sellers. Any such amounts received by Seller
by wire transfer shall be paid over to Purchaser promptly by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Purchaser designated on
Exhibit T or to any other account designated by the Purchaser in writing and
delivered to Polaroid in accordance with Section 10.02. Sellers shall promptly
send Purchaser copies of all remittance advices and checks related to payments
received by Sellers with respect to such items. Purchaser shall notify the
Business' customers of the change in address of the owner of the Acquired Assets
as may be required in order for such customers to properly remit any payments
required under any applicable Acquired Asset and Sellers shall cooperate with
Purchaser as is reasonably necessary to so notify such customers.

          Section 6.06.    BANKRUPTCY ACTIONS.

                  (a)      Within three days after the execution of this
Agreement, Polaroid shall, and shall cause the other Sellers to, file a motion
or motions (and related notices and proposed orders) with the Bankruptcy Court
seeking approval of the Sale Procedures Order and the Approval Order.

                                     - 43 -
<Page>

                  (b)      If the Approval Order, or any other orders of the
Bankruptcy Court relating to this Agreement shall be appealed by any Person (or
a petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing or reargument shall be filed
with respect thereto), the Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to defend against such appeal, petition or motion, and the Purchaser agrees to
cooperate in such efforts.

                  (c)      The Sellers shall give to the Purchaser written
notice and a copy of all motions, applications and pleadings filed in the Case
with the Bankruptcy Court from and after the date hereof, at the time of such
filing, and in any event, so that such notice is actually received by the
Purchaser no later than three (3) Business Days in advance of any hearing or
presentment date with respect to such motion, application or other pleading.

          Section 6.07.    TAX MATTERS.

                  (a)      The parties agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any transfer, documentary, sales, use, excise, ad valorem,
registration, recordation, value-added, withholding, income and other similar
Taxes, whether such Taxes would be imposed by law upon the Purchaser or the
Sellers (such Taxes referred to herein as the "TRANSFER TAXES") to the extent
permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, and to the extent that such certificate or
other document would not increase the Taxes of the Purchaser. In addition, the
Sellers agree to obtain such tax clearance or similar certificates from any
Governmental Authority as the Purchaser may reasonably require (other than any
such certificates with respect to income or franchise taxes), and the Purchaser
shall provide such assistance as the Sellers may reasonably request in obtaining
such certificates.

                  (b)      The Purchaser may make elections under Code Sections
338(g) and 754 and Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 (the "ELECTIONS"), as
appropriate, in respect of its purchase of the Acquired Subsidiaries or other
entities included in the Business under this Agreement. Polaroid and the other
Sellers shall assist the Purchaser in the preparation and filing of the
Elections and shall take all such action as is required in order to give effect
to such Elections for state, local and foreign Tax purposes to the greatest
extent permitted by law.

                  (c)      Any agreement between Polaroid or the other Sellers,
on the one hand, and any of the Acquired Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
regarding allocation or payment of Taxes or amounts in lieu of Taxes shall be
deemed terminated as of the Closing.

                  (d)      The Sellers and the Foreign Subsidiaries shall notify
the Purchaser of any proposed United States federal, state, or local Tax
Election and any material foreign Tax Election not later than thirty days prior
to making such election. Neither the Sellers nor the Foreign Subsidiaries shall
make any Tax Election that could have a Material Adverse Effect without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Purchaser shall respond promptly to any request for consent to any
Tax Election pursuant to this Section 6.07(d). The Purchaser shall be deemed to
consent to any such election if it has not responded to any such request within
ten days of receiving such request. However, the Sellers and the Foreign
Subsidiaries may elect to carry back any Tax losses from Tax periods before the

                                     - 44 -
<Page>

Closing Date to prior Tax periods if such election does not bind the Purchaser
or the Foreign Subsidiaries for any Tax period or any portion thereof after the
Closing Date.

                  (e)      Not later than 45 days prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser a list of all Tax records of the Sellers
(to the extent that they relate to the Acquired Assets or the Foreign
Subsidiaries) and each of the Foreign Subsidiaries in the form set forth as
Exhibit Q, including without limitation the prior five Tax Returns of the
Sellers (to the extent that they relate to the Acquired Assets or the Foreign
Subsidiaries) and each of the Foreign Subsidiaries. The Sellers and the Foreign
Subsidiaries shall grant the Purchaser access to all such records prior to the
Closing and shall ensure that the Purchaser may take possession of all such
records at or after the Closing if the Purchaser so elects. The Sellers and the
Foreign Subsidiaries shall provide such access to their computer systems
containing Tax information as may reasonably be requested by the Purchaser. The
Purchaser agrees to bear any reasonable costs incurred by the Sellers in
duplicating and mailing any records that the Purchaser has requested that the
Sellers duplicate and mail to the Purchaser prior to the Closing.

                  (f)      The Sellers agree to pay all Transfer Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Approval Order shall contain a provision that
the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of the Acquired Assets to the
Purchaser hereunder shall be entitled to the protections afforded under Section
1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  (g)      The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance relating to the Acquired Assets, including,
without limitation, access to Books and Records, as is reasonably necessary for
the filing of all Tax Returns by the Purchaser or the Sellers, the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing
authority, and the prosecution or defense of any Claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax. Each of the Purchaser and the Sellers shall retain all
Books and Records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Acquired Assets until
the later of six years following the Closing Date and the expiration of the
statute of limitations period (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser or
the Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority.
At the end of such period, each party shall provide the other with at least ten
days prior written notice before transferring, destroying or discarding any such
Books and Records, during which period the party receiving such notice can elect
to take possession, at its own expense, of such Books and Records. The Purchaser
and the Sellers shall cooperate fully with each other in the conduct of any
audit, litigation or other proceeding relating to Taxes involving the Acquired
Assets, provided that the Sellers or the Purchaser, as appropriate, shall
reimburse the Purchaser or the Sellers for reasonable costs associated with such
cooperation. The Purchaser and the Sellers further agree, upon request, to use
their best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby), to the extent that
such certificate or other document would not increase the Taxes of the
Purchaser.

                  (h)      PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS.

                           (i)    Unless prohibited by applicable law, Purchaser
     and Sellers shall close all Tax periods of the Foreign Subsidiaries on the
     Closing Date, and shall cooperate to complete any necessary elections or
     filings to close all Tax periods on the Closing Date. Purchaser shall cause
     to be prepared and filed all income or franchise Tax Returns required to be
     filed with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending
     prior to or on the Closing Date and including amended returns, applications
     for loss carryback refunds and applications for estimated tax refunds (all
     such income and franchise Tax Returns, amended returns and refund
     applications are referred to as the "PRIOR PERIOD RETURNS"). Sellers shall
     make available to Purchaser (and to Purchaser's accountants and attorneys)
     any and all books and records and other documents and information in its
     possession or control relating to the Foreign Subsidiaries requested by
     Purchaser to prepare the Prior Period Returns. If any Prior Period Returns
     reflect an obligation to pay Taxes that were not accrued on the books of
     account of the Foreign Subsidiaries through the Closing Date, then the
     Purchasers shall provide to the Sellers such Prior Period Returns within 15
     days prior to the due date for such returns, including extensions, and the
     Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser, not later than 5 days prior to the due
     date for such returns, an amount equal to the excess of such Taxes over
     such accruals.

                           (ii)   A "STRADDLE PERIOD" is any Tax period that
     includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date. Purchasers shall cause to
     be prepared and filed all income or franchise Tax Returns required to be
     filed with respect to the Foreign Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period
     (each a "STRADDLE PERIOD RETURN"). Income or franchise Taxes attributable
     to any Straddle Period shall be determined as if the Tax period ended on
     the Closing Date based on a closing of the books on such date. The Sellers
     shall be responsible for income or franchise Taxes for that portion of any
     Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date. If the portion of the Tax shown
     on any such Tax Return that is the responsibility of the Sellers ("SELLERS'
     PORTION") exceeds the accruals for such Taxes on the applicable Foreign
     Subsidiary's books of account, then the Purchasers shall provide a copy of
     such Tax Return, together with a computation of the Sellers' Portion,
     within 15 days prior to the due date for such returns, including
     extensions. Sellers shall pay the excess of the Sellers' Portion over such
     accruals to the Purchaser no later than 5 days prior to the due date of any
     Straddle Period Tax Return.

                           (iii)  Purchaser shall file any and all other Tax
     Returns for any Acquired Subsidiary that are not Prior Period Returns or
     Straddle Period Tax Returns and which are to be filed after the Closing
     Date.

                  (i)      Not later than July 8, 2002, the Sellers shall
provide to the Purchaser a list of all outstanding intercompany indebtedness in
effect as of June 2, 2002 between the Foreign Subsidiaries and between any
Sellers and the Foreign Subsidiaries, identifying in each case the specific
obligor and obligee. With respect to any fiscal month of the Sellers ending
after June 2, 2002 and prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall provide a new
list of all such outstanding intercompany indebtedness in effect as of the end
of such fiscal month between the Foreign Subsidiaries and between any Sellers
and the Foreign Subsidiaries within 25

                                     - 46 -
<Page>

days following the end of any such fiscal month, identifying in each case the
specific obligor and obligee. The Sellers agree that, immediately prior to the
Closing, and after giving effect to the transactions set forth in Section 6.19,
the Sellers will, at the Purchaser's request, (i) cause any outstanding
intercompany indebtedness owed by any Foreign Subsidiary to any Seller to be
contributed to such Foreign Subsidiary or Foreign Subsidiaries as may be
designated by the Purchaser prior to the Closing (including, but not limited to,
a new Foreign Subsidiary formed at Purchaser's request for this purpose) and
(ii) cause any outstanding intercompany indebtedness owed by any Seller to any
Foreign Subsidiary to be cancelled or assumed by such Foreign Subsidiary or
Foreign Subsidiaries as may be designated by the Purchaser prior to the Closing
(including, but not limited to, a new Foreign Subsidiary formed at Purchaser's
request for this purpose); PROVIDED THAT, in each case the Purchaser shall bear
all costs and capital or similar foreign Taxes imposed as a result of such
contributions, cancellations or assumptions. Any such requests by the Purchaser
shall be made only with respect to such intercompany indebtedness as remains
outstanding after first taking into account the actions relating to such
indebtedness set forth in Section 6.19.

                  (j)      The Sellers agree to cooperate with the Purchaser in
making any Tax elections and any restructuring of the Sellers' operations that
the Purchaser may reasonably request after the issuance of the Approval Order,
including without limitation any elections under Treasury Regulations Section
301.7701-3.

          Section 6.08.    CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS.

                  (a)      Not less than thirty-five (35) days prior to the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall provide Sellers with a true, correct and
complete list (the "35 DAY LIST") of (i) all Polaroid Employees to whom the
Purchaser intends to offer employment, commencing on the Closing Date, at the
salary levels and other terms of employment determined by the Purchaser in its
sole and absolute discretion, and (ii) all temporary employees, contract
employees and leased employees with whom Purchaser intends to continue a service
provider relationship, all of whom shall be considered U.S. employees for
purposes of this Section 6.08 and Section 6.09. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement hereunder
shall confer upon any such Hired Employees any right to continue in the employ
of, or as a consultant for, the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, which are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge any such Hired
Employees at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except
to the extent expressly provided otherwise in a written employment agreement
between any such Hired Employees and the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

                  (b)      From and after the Closing Date, each Seller shall
remain responsible for any and all Liabilities (other than Assumed Liabilities)
with respect to the Hired Employees or their beneficiaries or dependents that
were or are incurred by such individuals on or prior to the Closing Date under
such Seller's applicable Welfare Plans for health, life, accidental death and
dismemberment, supplemental employment compensation, dental, fringe benefits,
expense reimbursement, accident, sickness and disability benefits. For purposes
of this Agreement, (i) a claim for health benefits (including, without
limitation, claims for medical, prescription drug, dental, and vision care
expenses) will be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which the related
medical service is rendered; (ii) a claim for sickness or disability

                                     - 47 -
<Page>

benefits will be deemed to have been incurred on the date such sickness or
disability occurs, and (iii) in the case of any claim for benefits other than
health benefits (e.g., life insurance benefits), a claim will be deemed to have
been incurred upon the occurrence of the event giving rise to such claims. The
Purchaser shall be responsible for all claims that are incurred by the Hired
Employees on or after the Closing Date under the applicable benefit plans,
policies or arrangements providing health, life, accidental death and
dismemberment, supplemental employment compensation, dental, fringe benefits,
expense reimbursement, accident, sickness and disability benefits and which are
maintained by the Purchaser (collectively, the "PURCHASER'S WELFARE BENEFIT
PLANS"). During the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending no
fewer than 20 days before the Closing Date, the Sellers and the Purchaser shall
cooperate to determine the extent, if any, to which the Purchaser will adopt any
of Sellers' Welfare Benefit Plans as Purchaser's Welfare Benefit Plans for the
benefit of any Hired Employees and to determine an appropriate mechanism for the
satisfaction of any COBRA obligations that are Assumed Liabilities under this
Agreement.

                  (c)      With respect to each employee benefit plan, program
or arrangement of the Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser in which any
Hired Employee participates, for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting, and entitlement to benefits, but not including benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, service with the Sellers shall
be treated as service with the Purchaser or such affiliate. Such service also
shall apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of
insurability requirements, or the application of any preexisting condition
limitations. Each such plan shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to
the same extent waived under the applicable plan of the Sellers. Hired Employees
shall be given credit under the applicable plan of the Purchaser or any
affiliate for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the same
period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket
maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the successor or replacement plan.

                  (d)      Purchaser will, and will cause the Purchaser's 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the "PURCHASER'S 401(k) PLAN") to accept the
rollover, by direct or indirect rollover, as selected by each Hired Employee, of
that portion of the Hired Employees' accounts in the Sellers' 401(k) Plan
("SELLERS' 401(k) PLAN") that constitutes an "eligible rollover distribution" as
that term is defined by section 402(c)(4) of the Code, provided that at the time
a Hired Employee elects such a rollover that Hired Employee is employed by the
Purchaser. Any such rollover will be effected in cash and, as applicable, any
notes evidencing loans from the Sellers' 401(k) Plan to the Hired Employee
electing such rollover. Purchaser and Sellers will, and will cause the trustees
of their respective 401(k) plans to, cooperate with each other with respect to
the rollover of the eligible rollover distribution portions of the Hired
Employees' account balances in the Sellers' 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser's
401(k) Plan. Purchaser's 401(k) Plan will be substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to Sellers' 401(k) Plan, provided that (1) Purchaser is able to
negotiate administrative and investment contracts with third party record
keepers and investment managers comparable to those currently in effect under
Sellers' 401(k) Plan and (2) Purchaser shall not be required to incur costs in
connection with the design or operation of a substantially comparable plan that
materially exceed those incurred by Sellers' in the maintenance and operation of
Sellers' 401(k) Plan. If Purchaser is unable to negotiate administrative and
investment contracts consistent with subparagraph (1) above, within the

                                     - 48 -
<Page>

constraints of subparagraph (2) above, Purchaser will design a 401(k) plan for
the Hired Employees that is as comparable as possible to Sellers' 401(k) Plan
within those constraints.

                  (e)      Except as specifically provided herein and except for
the Assumed Liabilities, from and after the Closing Date, each Seller shall
remain responsible for any and all Liabilities accrued or payable under any
employment agreement between any Seller or any ERISA Affiliate and any Employee
or former Employee as well as under any Pension Plans, including without
limitation any supplemental retirement arrangements, bonus, stock purchase,
stock ownership, stock option, deferred compensation, incentive, severance,
termination or other compensation plan or arrangement, or other material
employee fringe benefit plans maintained by, or contributed to by any Seller or
any ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of any Employees or former Employees (and
the beneficiaries or dependents of any such Employees or former Employees) of
any Seller or any ERISA Affiliate.

                  (f)      On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide medical, dental, and life insurance benefits to Hired Employees
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the medical, dental, and life
insurance benefits provided by the Sellers immediately prior to the Closing
Date, provided that Purchaser shall not be required to incur costs in connection
with the design or operation of a substantially comparable plan that materially
exceed those incurred by Sellers in the maintenance and operation of Sellers'
medical, dental, and life insurance benefits.

                  (g)      Sellers and each ERISA Affiliate will retain all
liabilities connected with or arising from the Polaroid Pension Plan or any
other defined benefit pension plan maintained by any of them. Neither Purchaser
nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall have any liability with respect to any such
plan, including, without limitation, any obligation to provide any similar
pension plan after the Closing.

          Section 6.09.    WARN ACT NOTICES. During the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Sellers will terminate the employment of
such number of those U.S. employees whose employment is projected to be
terminated as the basis for the schedules of 2002 Projected Involuntary
Terminations and 2002 Severance Cost Estimates provided by Sellers to Purchaser.
In addition, Sellers will terminate the employment of those U.S. employees who
are not listed on the 35 Day List. The Sellers shall be solely responsible for
providing any required notice under the WARN Act arising from any of the
Sellers' termination/layoff of any Polaroid Employees pursuant to this Section
6.09, or any other employment decision made by Sellers (whether such
termination/layoff occurs on, before, or after the Closing Date).

          Section 6.10.    ADDITIONAL MATTERS. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the Contemplated
Transactions, including using all reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents, and approvals in connection with the Governmental
Requirements and, at the instruction of the Purchaser, to cause any local
nominee holding shares of any Acquired Subsidiary to transfer such shares to a
Person designated by the Purchaser.

<Page>

          Section 6.11.    GUARANTEES. The Purchaser agrees to provide
guarantees, effective as of the Closing, for any obligations of the Sellers
provided on behalf of the Acquired Subsidiaries in the agreements and
arrangements listed in Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "SELLER
GUARANTEES"), as required by the Seller Guarantees in order to relieve the
Sellers of such obligations.

          Section 6.12.    NO SOLICITATIONS. From and after the execution of
this Agreement and until the date the Bankruptcy Court enters the Sale
Procedures Order, the Sellers shall not cause, authorize or permit any of their
Representatives, Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, directly or indirectly, (a)
except with respect to the Committee, solicit, seek, initiate, negotiate,
assist, facilitate or encourage the submission of, or accept or agree to, or
otherwise cooperate in any way with any Acquisition Proposal or (b) except in
the Ordinary Course of Business, furnish any non-public information to any
Person, other than the Purchaser, its Affiliates or their Representatives, any
pre-Petition and post-Petition secured lenders of the Business, or the Committee
and their Representatives, with respect to the Business or any of the Acquired
Assets. If Sellers or any of their Representatives, Subsidiaries or Affiliates
receive from any Person any Acquisition Proposal, offer, inquiry or information
request regarding the Business or any of the Acquired Assets, Sellers will
promptly advise such Person, by written notice (with a copy to the Purchaser),
of the terms of this Section and the Bidding Procedures and will promptly (and,
in any event, within 24 hours) advise the Purchaser in writing of such
Acquisition Proposal, offer, inquiry or informational request, and deliver
copies of any written materials received by any Seller or their Representatives
at any time in connection therewith, and keep the Purchaser fully informed of
the timing and contents of, and provide the Purchaser with copies of, any
further written or oral communications related thereto.

          Section 6.13.    ASSUMED CONTRACTS; CURE AMOUNTS.

                  (a)      As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the
Sellers shall, pursuant to a motion in form and substance acceptable to the
Purchaser (which motion may be incorporated into a motion seeking the approval
of all of the Contemplated Transactions), move to assume and assign to the
Purchaser the Assumed Contracts (as defined below) and shall provide notice
thereof in accordance with all applicable bankruptcy rules. On or before May 10,
2002, the Sellers will deliver to the Purchaser a true, correct, and complete
list of the monetary amounts the Sellers believe are necessary to cure, in
accordance with Bankruptcy Code section 365, the monetary defaults with respect
to each pre-Petition Contract of the Sellers relating to the Business. Not later
than May 17, 2002, Purchaser will provide to the Sellers a preliminary list of
each pre-Petition Contract of the Sellers relating to the Business that the
Purchaser has selected to constitute the pre-Petition Contracts to be assumed
and assigned to Purchaser at the Closing in connection with the Transactions
(the "PRELIMINARY ASSUMED CONTRACTS LIST"). As soon as practicable thereafter,
and in any event, no later than May 20, 2002, the Sellers shall provide notice
to the non-Seller parties to the Contracts on the Preliminary Assumed Contracts
List (A) of the Sellers' intention to assume, assign, and transfer such
designated Contracts to the Purchaser, (B) of the amount, if any, required to be
paid to cure any monetary default related to each such Contract, (C) of the
Purchasers' right to amend or modify the Preliminary Assumed Contracts List as
provided in the Sale Procedures Order and in this Agreement and (D) containing
such other matters as requested by the Purchaser. Specifically, Purchaser may
(i) at any time up to ten (10) days prior to the Auction, add additional
pre-Petition Contracts to the

                                     - 50 -
<Page>

Preliminary Assumed Contracts List, in which case such additional pre-Petition
Contract(s) shall be assumed and assigned to the Purchaser and shall be part of
the Initial Assumed Contracts (as defined below) and Acquired Assets and/or (ii)
at any time up to one (1) Business Day prior to the Auction, withdraw any
pre-Petition Contract from the Preliminary Assumed Contracts List, in which case
such withdrawn pre-Petition Contract(s) shall not be assumed and assigned to the
Purchaser and shall not be part of the Initial Assumed Contracts or the Acquired
Assets, such that no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Auction,
Purchaser shall provide the Sellers with the final list of the pre-Petition
Contracts of the Sellers relating to the Business to be assumed and transferred
to Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to the Approval Order (collectively, the
"INITIAL ASSUMED CONTRACTS").

                  (b)      In addition, subsequent to the date that is ten (10)
days prior to the Auction but prior to the Closing, Purchaser may notify the
Sellers of its intention to assume any other or additional pre-Petition
Contract(s) of the Sellers relating to the Business that (i) has not otherwise
been rejected, assumed, or assigned by the Sellers or (ii) is not the subject of
a pending Bankruptcy Court motion of the Sellers to reject, assume, or assign,
as of the date of such notice (the "ADDITIONAL ASSUMED CONTRACTS" and, together
with the Post-Petition Contracts and the Initial Assumed Contracts, the "ASSUMED
CONTRACTS"). As soon as practicable after the date of receiving such notice from
the Purchaser with respect to the Additional Assumed Contracts, the Sellers
shall, pursuant to a motion in form and substance acceptable to the Purchaser,
move to assume and assign the Additional Assumed Contracts to the Purchaser, and
shall provide notice thereof in accordance with all applicable bankruptcy rules.
The Purchaser shall not be obligated to provide the Sellers with any additional
consideration in connection with any such assumption and assignment of the
Additional Assumed Contracts beyond the Consideration. None of the Sellers shall
reject any Contract of Sellers relating to the Business prior to the Closing
Date without the consent of Purchaser. In connection with any such assumption
and assignment of the Assumed Contracts, Purchaser shall be responsible for any
Cure Amounts.

          Section 6.14.    TITLE INSURANCE. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Purchaser in obtaining good and valid, irrevocable
ALTA title insurance commitments (collectively, the "TITLE COMMITMENTS", and
each a "TITLE COMMITMENT"), in final form, from the title insurance company
selected by Purchaser (the "TITLE COMPANY"). Seller shall supply such
information within its control or possession and shall provide Title Company
with such certificates, affidavits and other documentation as reasonably
necessary, to enable Title Company to irrevocably commit (subject only to the
satisfaction of any industry standard requirements contained in the Title
Commitment and reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) to issuing ALTA form of title
insurance policies insuring good, valid, indefeasible fee simple title to the
Owned Real Estate in Purchaser, in such respective amounts that Purchaser
requires prior to Closing, subject to no Encumbrances or other exceptions to
title other than Permitted Encumbrances (collectively the "TITLE POLICIES"). On
or prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to the Title Company any affidavits, standard gap
indemnities and similar documents reasonably requested by the Title Company in
connection with the issuance of the Title Commitments or the Title Policies. The
Purchaser shall pay at Closing all premiums and other fees, costs and expenses
necessary for the issuance of the Title Policies.

                                     - 51 -
<Page>

          Section 6.15.    SURVEYS.  Sellers shall make  available to Purchaser
all surveys and other documents and information in its possession or control
relating to the Owned Real Estate.

          Section 6.16.    ZONING  COMPLIANCE.  Sellers  shall,  at the request
of Purchaser, reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its agents and contractors
in obtaining certificates of occupancy for the Owned Real Estate.

          Section 6.17.    BULK  TRANSFER  LAWS.  Each  Seller and the
Purchaser hereby waive compliance by the Sellers with the provisions of any Bulk
Sales Laws.

          Section 6.18.    USE OF NAME. From and after the Closing, Purchaser
shall own all of the corporate names, trade names and trademarks included in the
Polaroid Intellectual Property, including without limitation, "Polaroid" and all
other variations thereof which include the "Polaroid" name, together with all
related designs (collectively, the "POLAROID NAME"). Each Seller shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement and, if not acquired by the Purchaser, Polaroid Foundation, Inc.
to, promptly following the Closing Date, change its name to delete any reference
to the Polaroid Name and any other corporate name, trade name or trademark
included in the Polaroid Intellectual Property (and file with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any certificates or instruments required to effect such
name change); provided, however, that Sellers may use the Polaroid Name in
connection with the disposition of the Case.

          Section 6.19.    TREATMENT OF INTERCOMPANY PAYABLES AND INTERCOMPANY
RECEIVABLES.

                  (a)      Each Seller agrees that, prior to the Closing, it
will (i) offset outstanding intercompany liabilities, including, but not limited
to, ordinary course payables and loans payable, which arose prior to the Filing
Date (the "PRE-PETITION INTERCOMPANY PAYABLES") owed by such Seller to each
Foreign Subsidiary against intercompany accounts receivable which arose prior to
the Filing Date (the "PRE-PETITION INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES") owed by each such
Foreign Subsidiary to such Seller, (ii) offset outstanding Post-Petition
Intercompany Payables owed by such Seller to each Foreign Subsidiary against
intercompany accounts receivable which arose on or after the Filing Date (the
"POST-PETITION INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES") owed by each such Foreign Subsidiary
to such Seller, (iii) after the offsets described in clauses (i) and (ii) above,
offset outstanding Post-Petition Intercompany Payables owed by such Seller to
each Foreign Subsidiary against the Pre-Petition Intercompany Receivables owed
by each such Foreign Subsidiary to such Seller, and (iv) cooperate in any
filings and proceedings before the Bankruptcy Court as may be necessary to
effect the offsets described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above.

                  (b)      After accounting for the offset of accounts
receivable and accounts payable described in subsection (a) above, the Sellers
may cause those Foreign Subsidiaries that have accounts payable to the Sellers
to pay in cash all or a portion of such accounts payable to the Sellers (such
accounts to be paid down being the "RELATED PARTY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE");
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Sellers shall not cause such Foreign
Subsidiaries to pay down the Related Party Accounts Receivable if such payment
would reduce the Cash and Cash Equivalents held by the Foreign Subsidiaries to
be less than the minimum amount specified in

                                     - 52 -
<Page>

Section 8.03(f) hereof; (ii) any Related Party Accounts Receivable repaid will
be repaid at their face amount; (iii) the Sellers will inform the Purchaser in
writing of the proposed repayment of any Related Party Accounts Receivable at
least five Business Days prior to such repayment; and (iv) to the extent
requested by the Purchaser in writing, the Sellers will cause the Foreign
Subsidiaries not to pay down the Related Party Accounts Receivable specified by,
and in the amount requested by, the Purchaser in writing (the "DESIGNATED
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE"), but instead will cause such Foreign Subsidiaries, as
requested by the Purchaser in writing, to either (x) pay the cash that would
have been used to pay down the Designated Accounts Receivable to the Sellers as
dividends, capital reductions, capital returns, or otherwise (such dividends,
capital reductions, or capital returns being the "REQUESTED DIVIDENDS"), (y)
loan the cash that would have been used to pay down the Designated Accounts
Receivable to such other Foreign Subsidiary specified by the Purchaser in
writing, which will, in turn, use the proceeds of such loan to, as requested by
the Purchaser in writing, either pay down its Related Party Accounts Receivable
or pay Requested Dividends or (z) hold the cash that would have been used to pay
down the Designated Accounts Receivable in such Foreign Subsidiaries (it being
understood that the Cash and Cash Equivalents held by the Foreign Subsidiaries
at Closing may exceed the maximum amount specified in Section 8.03(f) to the
extent this clause (z) causes the Cash and Cash Equivalents held by the Foreign
Subsidiaries at Closing to exceed such maximum amount). The Purchaser and the
Sellers will work together to minimize the amount of any foreign withholding
Taxes imposed upon the Requested Dividends (the "REQUESTED DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING
TAXES"). To the extent that the Foreign Subsidiaries pay the Requested Dividends
and the Purchaser and the Sellers cannot eliminate any Requested Dividend
Withholding Taxes, then the Purchaser agrees to increase the Cash Consideration
by an amount equal to the Requested Dividend Withholding Taxes.

                  (c)      The Sellers further agree, upon request of the
Purchaser, to cause the Foreign Subsidiaries to cancel or forgive immediately
prior to the Closing all or any portion of any outstanding Pre-Petition
Intercompany Payables owed by the Sellers to the Foreign Subsidiaries, after
giving effect to any offsets requested by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
6.19. To the extent that pursuant to this Section 6.19(c) the Sellers cause
Polaroid Contracting CV to cancel or forgive any Pre-Petition Intercompany
Payables, the Sellers shall cause such Foreign Subsidiaries as are designated by
the Purchaser to cancel or forgive an equal amount of any loans owed to them by
Polaroid Contracting CV.

                  (d)      The Sellers agree to retain as Excluded Assets the
Designated Accounts Receivable and such other accounts receivable from the
Foreign Subsidiaries as the Purchaser may request in writing (collectively, the
"RETAINED RELATED PARTY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE"). At Closing, the Purchaser shall
cause the Foreign Subsidiaries to pay in full all of the Retained Related Party
Accounts Receivable.

                  (e)      The Purchaser and the Sellers will cooperate to
minimize any foreign Taxes and costs associated with the actions contemplated by
this Section 6.19. In the event that the Purchaser requests that the Sellers
take any actions pursuant to this Section 6.19 that the Sellers would not
otherwise be required to take, and the Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to
eliminate the costs and foreign Taxes associated with such actions, then the
Purchaser will pay any costs and foreign Taxes incurred by the Sellers as a
result of such actions (except to

                                     - 53 -
<Page>

the extent that such foreign Taxes are Requested Dividend Withholding Taxes that
give rise to an increase to the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 6.19(b)).

          Section 6.20.    CLOSING DATE DIVIDENDS AND SHARE BUYBACK. The Sellers
agree that, if requested by the Purchaser in writing, they will (a) cause the
Foreign Subsidiaries specified in writing by the Purchaser (the "BORROWING
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES") to enter into a Credit Agreement (the "CREDIT AGREEMENT")
in form and substance satisfactory to the Purchaser immediately prior to the
Closing, (b) cause each Borrowing Foreign Subsidiary to borrow such amount as is
requested by the Purchaser in writing, and (c) cause each such Borrowing Foreign
Subsidiary to either (i) distribute such borrowings to the Sellers as a dividend
or distribution, (ii) use such borrowings to repurchase or redeem the shares of
such Borrowing Foreign Subsidiary from the Sellers, or (iii) loan such
borrowings to such other Foreign Subsidiary as may be requested by the Purchaser
in writing, which will distribute such borrowings to the Sellers or repurchase
or redeem the shares of such other Foreign Subsidiary from the Sellers (all such
payments described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to as the
"RELATED PARTY SPECIAL DIVIDENDS"). The Purchaser and the Sellers agree to
reduce the Cash Consideration by the net amount of any Related Party Special
Dividends actually paid to the Sellers, after accounting for any foreign
withholding Taxes imposed on such Related Party Special Dividends (the "NET
RELATED PARTY SPECIAL DIVIDENDS").

                                   ARTICLE VII
                        ADDITIONAL POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

          Section 7.01.    FURTHER ASSURANCES. In addition to the provisions of
this Agreement, from time to time after the Closing Date, the Sellers and the
Purchaser will use all reasonable efforts to execute and deliver such other
instruments of conveyance, transfer, or assumption, as the case may be, and take
such other action as may be reasonably requested to implement more effectively
the Contemplated Transactions.

          Section 7.02.    BOOKS AND RECORDS; PERSONNEL. Sellers and Purchaser
shall reasonably cooperate with each other after the Closing so that (subject to
any limitations that are reasonably required to preserve applicable
attorney-client privilege) each party and any of their Representatives
reasonable access to the respective officers and employees of the other party,
and reasonable access to all business records, contracts and other documents and
information of the other party existing at the Closing Date and relating to the
Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities or the
conduct of the Business (including copies thereof) as is reasonably necessary
for the (a) administration of the Case, or preparation for or the prosecution or
defense of any existing or future Legal Proceeding (other than one by or on
behalf of a party to this Agreement) by or against Sellers or Purchaser, (b)
preparation and filing of any Tax Return or election relating to the Acquired
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the conduct of the Business and any audit by
any taxing authority of any returns of Purchaser or Sellers relating thereto,
(c) preparation and filing of any other documents required by governmental or
regulatory bodies, and (d) transfer of data to Purchaser relating to the
Business. The party requesting such information and assistance shall reimburse
the other party for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such party
in providing such information and in rendering such assistance, except that
Sellers shall bear the costs and expenses of transferring to Purchaser or its
designee data and other information reasonably requested by Purchaser in order
to enable Purchaser to

                                     - 54 -
<Page>

establish and operate its own data systems. The access to files, books and
records contemplated by this Section 7.02 shall be during normal business hours
and upon not less than two Business Days' prior written request, shall be
subject to such reasonable limitations as the party having custody or control
thereof may impose to preserve the confidentiality of information contained
therein, and shall not extend to material subject to a claim of privilege unless
expressly waived by the party entitled to claim the same. Unless prohibited by
Law, the Sellers shall provide to the Purchaser copies of all personnel records
and other Books and Records retained by the Sellers under Section 2.02(c) of
this Agreement.

          Section 7.03.    CONTINUED COOPERATION. If any transfer or assignment
by the Sellers to, or any assumption by the Purchaser of, any interest in, or
liability, obligation or commitment under, any Acquired Asset requires the
consent of a Third Party, and any such consent is not obtained prior to the
Closing, then, if Purchaser so elects, such Acquired Asset shall not be
transferred to Purchaser at the Closing Date and the Sellers shall cooperate in
any lawful and reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by the Purchaser
(including the appointment of Purchaser as attorney-in-fact for the Sellers) and
do or cause to be done all such things as shall in the reasonable opinion of
Purchaser or its counsel be necessary or proper to (a) assure that the rights of
Purchaser under such Acquired Asset shall be preserved for the benefit of or
transferred or issued to Purchaser and (b) obtain for Purchaser the economic
benefits under the asset, claim or right with respect to which the consent has
not been obtained. Such reasonable arrangement may include (a) the
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the Purchaser of any and all
rights of the Sellers against the other party to such third-party agreement
arising out of a breach or cancellation thereof by the other party, and (b) the
enforcement by the Sellers of such rights. To the extent, and only to the
extent, the Purchaser is able to receive the economic claims, rights and
benefits under such asset, the Purchaser shall be responsible for the Assumed
Liabilities, if any, arising under such Acquired Asset.

          Section 7.04.    ESTATE COSTS. (a) If, after June 2, 2002, the
aggregate amount of the Estate Costs paid or incurred exceeds $27,000,000, then
the Sellers and/or their successor(s) may not incur any expenses to pursue any
causes of action, judgments, Claims or demands that constitute Excluded Assets
without the Purchaser's and the Agent's prior written consents, which consents
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (b)      If, after June 2, 2002 and until the distribution of
all of the Sellers' Stock by the Sellers and/or their successor(s) to the
creditors of the Sellers, the aggregate amount of the Estate Costs paid exceeds
$27,000,000 (and the Sellers and/or their successor(s) do not have any cash
available to pay additional Estate Costs), then, for any Estate Costs in excess
of $27,000,000 that become due and payable, the Purchaser forthwith shall pay to
the Sellers and/or their successor(s) an amount equal to such excess up to
$4,000,000 in cash, upon receipt by the Purchaser of reasonably satisfactory
documentation evidencing Sellers' and/or their successors(s)' obligation to pay
such Estate Costs. If, after June 2, 2002 and until the distribution of all of
the Sellers' Stock by the Sellers and/or their successor(s) to the creditors of
the Sellers, the aggregate amount of the Estate Costs paid exceeds $31,000,000
(and the Sellers and/or their successor(s) do not have any cash available to pay
additional Estate Costs), the Sellers and the Purchaser understand that, for any
Estate Costs in excess of $31,000,000 that become due and payable, the Agent, on
behalf of the secured lenders to the Sellers, forthwith shall pay to the Sellers
and/or their successor(s) an amount equal to such excess up to $3,000,000

                                     - 55 -
<Page>

in cash (the "BANK REIMBURSEMENT"), upon receipt by the Agent of reasonably
satisfactory documentation evidencing Sellers' and/or their successors(s)'
obligation to pay such Estate Costs. If, after June 2, 2002 and until the
distribution of all of the Sellers' Stock by the Sellers and/or their
successor(s) to the creditors of the Sellers, the aggregate amount of the Estate
Costs paid exceeds $34,000,000 (and the Sellers and/or their successor(s) do not
have any cash available to pay additional Estate Costs), then, for any Estate
Costs in excess of $34,000,000 that become due and payable, the Purchaser
forthwith shall pay to the Sellers and/or their successor(s) an amount equal to
such excess up to $3,000,000 in cash (the "SECOND TIER REIMBURSEMENT"), upon
receipt by the Purchaser of reasonably satisfactory documentation evidencing
Sellers' and/or their successors(s)' obligation to pay such Estate Costs.

                  (c)      If, after June 2, 2002 and until the distribution of
all of the Sellers' Stock by the Sellers and/or their successor(s) to the
creditors of the Sellers, the aggregate amount of the Estate Costs paid or
required to be paid exceeds $37,000,000 (and the Sellers and/or their
successor(s) do not have any cash available to pay additional Estate Costs),
then, for any Estate Costs in excess of $37,000,000 that become due and payable,
and for the sole purpose of generating cash to fund all or a portion of such
excess, up to a maximum excess of $4,500,000, the Sellers and/or their
successor(s) shall have the right, but not the obligation, to sell to the
Purchaser up to such number of shares of the Sellers' Stock as shall equal four
percent (4%) of the Issued Stock for a maximum aggregate purchase price of
$4,500,000, as follows: the Sellers and/or their successor(s) shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to sell such number of shares of the Sellers'
Stock to the Purchaser at a price equal to: (i) for the first two percent (2%)
of the Issued Stock, $1,250,000 for each one percent (1%) of the Issued Stock
(or a pro-rata price based thereon); and (ii) for the next two percent (2%) of
the Issued Stock, $1,000,000 for each one percent (1%) of the Issued Stock (or a
pro-rata price based thereon). If more than one class of stock is included in
the Sellers' Stock, all sales of stock by the Sellers and/or their successor(s)
to the Purchaser pursuant to this paragraph must include the same percentage of
each class of stock included in the Sellers' Stock. Except in the case of a
distribution by the Sellers and/or their successor(s) to the holders of allowed
Claims in the Case under a confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, if the
Sellers and/or their successor(s) wish to sell or otherwise transfer shares of
the Sellers' Stock to a Third Party pursuant to a bona fide written offer
therefor, then the Sellers and/or their successor(s) shall give the Purchaser
written notice thereof, which notice shall (x) include a copy of such bona fide
written offer and a description of any other material terms of the offer not
contained in such offer, including the identity of the transferee, the price or
other consideration for which the shares of the Sellers' Stock are proposed to
be sold or transferred, and the number of shares of the Sellers' Stock to be
sold or transferred, and (y) contain an irrevocable offer to sell such shares of
the Sellers' Stock to the Purchaser at the same price and on the same terms
contained in the bona fide written offer. For a period of twenty days after its
receipt of such notice, the Purchaser and/or its designee(s) shall have the
right and option to purchase all or a portion of the shares of the Sellers'
Stock at the same price and on the same terms contained in the bona fide written
offer.

                  (d)      If (i) there remains any assets in the Sellers and/or
their successor(s) (the "REMAINING ASSETS") and (ii) either the Agent shall have
made a Bank Reimbursement or the Purchaser shall have made a Second Tier
Reimbursement, then, unless the Sellers and/or their successor(s) determine in
good faith that there continues to be a reasonable expectation of additional
Estate Costs, the Sellers and/or their successor(s) shall (x) pay to the

                                     - 56 -
<Page>

Purchaser such percentage of the Remaining Assets as the amount of the Second
Tier Reimbursement actually paid bears to the sum of the amount of the Bank
Reimbursement actually paid and the amount of the Second Tier Reimbursement
actually paid (such sum, the "TOTAL REIMBURSEMENT PAID"), up to $5,000,000 and
(y) pay to the Agent, for the benefit of the secured lenders to the Sellers,
such percentage of the Remaining Assets as the amount of the Bank Reimbursement
actually paid bears to the Total Reimbursement Paid, up to $5,000,000. The
Sellers and/or their successor(s) shall not make any distributions or payments
(other than distributions of the Sellers' Stock or on account of Estate Costs)
unless the Sellers shall have (i) made all of the payments described in the
immediately preceding sentence and (ii) waived their rights to receive any and
all payments under Section 7.04(b) and waived their rights to sell the Sellers'
Stock to the Purchaser under Section 7.04(c).

                  (e)      For purposes of this Section 7.04, "successor(s)" to
the Sellers shall mean a plan administrator or a liquidating trust or an entity
serving a comparable function, and shall not include the creditors of the
Sellers to whom the Sellers' Stock is distributed.

          Section 7.05.    DISTRIBUTION OF THE SELLERS' STOCK. Sellers agree
that, without the written consent of the Purchaser, the Sellers will not sell or
otherwise transfer or distribute the Sellers' Stock except pursuant to a
distribution by the Sellers to the holders of allowed Claims in the Case under a
confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or to One Equity Partners LLC.
Sellers further agree that the Sellers' plan of reorganization (the "PROPOSED
PLAN") will, if requested by the Purchaser, contain, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, provisions to the following effect: (i)
the Purchaser shall be deemed to be a "successor" to the Sellers for the limited
purpose of the provisions of section 1145(a) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (ii)
the distribution of the Sellers' Stock under the Proposed Plan to the holders of
allowed Claims against the Sellers shall constitute the offer or sale under a
plan of the Sellers of a security in exchange for a claim against, an interest
in, or a claim for an administrative expense in the Case. In addition, Sellers
agree that any disclosure statement under section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code in
support of the Proposed Plan shall (i) contain a description, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser, of the exemption from
securities laws under section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to the
Sellers' Stock, and (ii) advise any holder of any Claim potentially entitled to
receive such Sellers' Stock to consult their own advisors with respect thereto.
The Purchaser shall cooperate with the Sellers in the preparation of any such
disclosure statement and provide such information regarding the Purchaser as
shall be necessary to ensure that the disclosure statement complies with section
1125 of the Bankruptcy Code. Sellers further agree that they will use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain a final and non-appealable order of the
Bankruptcy Court confirming the Proposed Plan, which final and non-appealable
order shall contain, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser, provisions to the following effect: (i) the Purchaser shall be deemed
to be a "successor" to the Sellers for the limited purpose of the provisions of
section 1145(a) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (ii) the distribution of the
Sellers' Stock under the Sellers' confirmed Chapter 11 plan to the holders of
allowed Claims against the Sellers shall constitute the offer or sale under a
plan of the Sellers of a security in exchange for a claim against, an interest
in, or a claim for an administrative expense in the Case.

          Section 7.06.    NON-TRANSFERABLE CLAIMS. If any cause of action,
judgment, Claim or demand intended to be included in the Acquired Assets
pursuant to Section 2.01(m) is not

                                     - 57 -
<Page>

transferable or assignable to the Purchaser for any reason, the Sellers agree
not to pursue any such cause of action, judgment, Claim or demand without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser.

Section 9.01(c)(i), (c)(ii), (d)(iii) or (d)(vi), and provided that the
Purchaser is not then in material breach of this Agreement for which the Sellers
had previously notified Purchaser (and in the case of Sections 9.01(c)(i) and
(c)(ii), such notice shall have been received by the Purchaser prior to the Bid
Deadline (as defined in the Bidding Procedures attached hereto as Exhibit M) and
such material breach shall not have been cured prior to the Auction (as defined

     Transaction or (y) the

                                     - 62 -
<Page>

     expiration of ninety (90) days following the date of the Bankruptcy Court's
     approval of such Competing Transaction;

                           (ii)   with respect to a termination pursuant to
     Section 9.01(c)(i)(B), the earlier of (x) the consummation of any such plan
     or alternative transaction sponsored or proposed by the Committee or (y)
     the expiration of ninety (90) days following the Approval Deadline;

                           (iii)  with respect to a termination pursuant to
     Section 9.01(c)(ii)(A), the earlier of (x) the consummation of any such
     sale, transfer, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all or a
     material portion of the Business or the Acquired Assets or (y) the
     expiration of ninety (90) days following the date the Sellers enter into
     any agreement to do any of the foregoing; and

                           (iv)   with respect to a termination pursuant to
     Section 9.01(c)(ii)(B), the earlier of (x) the consummation of any such
     plan of reorganization or liquidation for any of the Sellers or (y) the
     expiration of ninety (90) days following the date of filing of any such

                  (b)      In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.01(b), (d)(ii), (d)(iv), (d)(vii) or (e)(iii), and provided that (i)
the Purchaser is not then in material breach of this Agreement for which the
Sellers had previously notified the Purchaser, (ii) in the case of Section
9.01(b), the issuance of the relevant order, decree or ruling is not the result
of the status of the Purchaser or any action or conduct of the Purchaser, and
(iii) in the case of Sections 9.01(d)(ii), (d)(iv) and (d)(vii), the failure or
occurrence of the event giving rise to any such termination is not the result of
the status of the Purchaser or any action or conduct of the Purchaser (it being
understood that for purposes of this clause (iii), Purchaser's failure or
refusal to amend, modify or waive any rights or conditions under this Agreement
shall not be deemed to be an action or conduct of the Purchaser), then Polaroid
shall be obligated to pay the Purchaser an amount equal to the Purchaser's
reasonable fees and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees, expenses of its financial advisors, and expenses of other
consultants) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the "EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT") up to (x) if such termination shall

termination shall occur on or after June 12, 2002, three million five hundred
thousand dollars ($3,500,000). In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(i), and the Bankruptcy Court so authorizes, Polaroid
shall be obligated to pay the Purchaser an amount equal to the Expense
Reimbursement. Any Expense Reimbursement payable upon termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b), (d)(i), (d)(ii), (d)(iv), (d)(vii) or
(e)(iii) shall be immediately earned upon such termination and payable by the
Sellers to the Purchaser or its designee promptly upon the delivery of an
invoice related to such Expense Reimbursement to Polaroid by the Purchaser,
provided, however, that if the Sellers believe, in good faith, that the amount
of the Expense Reimbursement sought by the Purchaser is not reasonable, then
they shall have the right to seek Bankruptcy Court review thereof prior to
paying such amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 9.02, if the Sellers sell substantially all of their assets for
consideration totaling in excess of the consideration provided for herein within

equal to the Termination Payment (if the Expense Reimbursement has not been paid
previously) or the excess of the Termination Payment over the Expense
Reimbursement (if the Expense Reimbursement has been paid previously) (such
excess, the "EXCESS AMOUNT"). Any such Termination Payment or such Excess
Amount, as the case may be, shall be immediately earned and payable by the
Sellers to the Purchaser or its designee upon the closing of such sale.

                  (c)      The payment to the Purchaser or any designees of the

termination and abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
Section 9.01, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
parties to this Agreement and this Agreement shall terminate (subject to the
provisions of this Section 9) and the Contemplated Transactions shall be
abandoned, without further action by any of the parties hereto. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided herein no party hereto shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party to this Agreement resulting
from such termination except (a) that the provisions of Section 2.06 (Deposit
Amount), Section 6.04 (Public Announcements), this Article IX (Further
Agreements and Termination), Section 10.02 (Notices), Section 10.05 (Governing
Law), Section 10.06 (Venue and Retention of Jurisdiction) and Section 10.08
(Expenses) shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) no party waives any
claim or right against a breaching party in respect of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event the Purchaser is entitled to
receive the Termination Payment, the right of the Purchaser to receive such
amount shall constitute the Purchaser's sole remedy for (and such amount shall
constitute liquidated damages in respect of) any breach by any Seller of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that in the event the Sellers are
entitled to receive the Deposit Amount (or any part thereof) pursuant to Section
2.06, the right of the Sellers to receive such amount shall constitute the
Sellers' sole remedy for (and such amount shall constitute liquidated damages in
respect of) any breach by the Purchaser of any of its representations,

          Section 10.03.   DESCRIPTIVE  HEADINGS.  The  headings  contained  in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

          Section 10.04.   ENTIRE AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits and the Disclosure Schedule and the other documents and
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement and the
rights and obligations may not be assigned in whole or in part by any party
hereto, including by operation of law or otherwise except (a) with the written
consent of the other parties hereto, (b) by the Purchaser to one or more direct
or indirect subsidiaries or other Affiliates of the Purchaser which assignment
shall not relieve the Purchaser of any of its obligations hereunder or (c) by
the Purchaser as collateral security to any entity providing direct or indirect
financing to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. To the extent any such
assignment by the Purchaser relates to the assignment by any Seller of an
executory contract or unexpired lease hereunder and occurs prior to Closing such
that, at Closing, this Agreement will provide for the Sellers' assignment of
such executory contract or unexpired lease to a party other than the Purchaser,
such assignment by the Seller shall be subject to all applicable provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code.

          Section 10.05.   GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to the rules of conflict of laws of the State of Delaware that would
require application of any other law.

          Section 10.06.   VENUE AND RETENTION OF JURISDICTION. All actions
brought, arising out of, or related to the Contemplated Transactions shall be
brought in the Bankruptcy Court, and the Bankruptcy Court shall retain
jurisdiction to determine any and all such actions.

          Section 10.07.   RISK OF LOSS.  Prior to the Closing,  all risk of
loss, damage or destruction to all or any part of the Acquired Assets or the
Business shall be borne exclusively by the Sellers.

          Section 10.08.   EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, whether or not the actions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

          Section 10.09.   AMENDMENT.  This Agreement  (including the Exhibits
and the Disclosure Schedule) may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of the parties hereto.

          Section 10.10.   WAIVER. At any time prior to the Closing Date, the
parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party.

          Section 10.11.   COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement may be
executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. This
Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received
counterparts thereof signed by all the other parties hereto.

          Section 10.12.   SEVERABILITY; VALIDITY. If any provision of this
Agreement or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected
thereby, and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be
severable.

          Section 10.13.   NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OR LIABILITIES. Nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall (i) confer on any
Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors or assigns
any rights (including third party beneficiary rights), remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) constitute the parties
hereto as partners or as participants in a joint venture (iii) confer on any
director, officer or employee of the Purchaser or its Affiliates any obligations
or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not
provide third parties with any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of
action or other right in excess of those existing without reference to the terms
of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving to any
Employee or any other individual any right or entitlement under any Benefit Plan
maintained by Sellers except as expressly provided in such Benefit Plan. No
third party shall have any rights under Sections 502, 503 or 504 of ERISA or any
regulations thereunder because of this Agreement which would not otherwise exist
without reference to this Agreement. No third party shall have any right,
independent of any right which may exist irrespective of this Agreement, under
or granted by this Agreement, to bring any suit at law or equity for any matter
governed by or subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

          Section 10.14.   ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT. The parties hereto agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to
all other remedies available at law or in equity.

          Section 10.15.   SEPARATE AGREEMENTS. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained herein, the Purchaser and/or its designated Affiliate
may, at Purchaser's election, purchase all or a portion of the Sellers' right,
title and interest in and to any or all of the outstanding capital stock of the
Acquired Subsidiaries under one or more separate acquisition

                                     - 67 -
<Page>

agreements substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit S (each, an
"ACQUISITION AGREEMENT"). If the Purchaser and/or its designated Affiliate
elects to enter into one or more Acquisition Agreements, the Consideration for
the Acquired Assets under this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of the
purchase price for the capital stock of the Acquired Subsidiaries purchased or
sold under such Acquisition Agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of any allocations of consideration (as that term is defined in
Treasury Regulation section 1.1060-1(c)), the amounts paid under this Agreement
and any and all Acquisition Agreements shall be aggregated as set forth in
Section 3.03(c) of this Agreement. If the Purchaser and/or its designated
Affiliate elects to enter into one or more Acquisition Agreements, the
indemnification and other post-closing obligation provisions of this Agreement
shall apply to such Acquisition Agreements and be binding on the parties to such
Acquisition Agreements as if the capital stock of the Acquired Subsidiaries
purchased or sold under such Acquisition Agreements were purchased and sold
under this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing, the Sellers agree to
cooperate with the Purchaser in structuring the acquisition of the Foreign
Subsidiaries in such manner as the Purchaser may reasonably request to
facilitate any financing to be entered into by the Purchaser in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions. Furthermore, the Sellers agree to cooperate with
the Purchaser in transferring Cash and Cash Equivalents between the Sellers and
the Foreign Subsidiaries and between the Foreign Subsidiaries in such manner as
the Purchaser may reasonably request in connection with the Contemplated
Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the immediately foregoing two
sentences, the Sellers agree, at Purchaser's request in writing, to form new
entities and, immediately prior to the Closing, to transfer the equity interests
of Foreign Subsidiaries designated by the Purchaser in writing to such newly
formed entities and that in lieu of acquiring such designated Foreign
Subsidiaries, the Purchaser shall acquire all the equity interests of such newly
formed entities. The Sellers and the Purchaser agree that such newly formed
entities shall be deemed to be "Foreign Subsidiaries" under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, the Sellers
shall not be required to take any action pursuant to this Section 10.15 unless
the Purchaser agrees to reimburse the Sellers for any added costs or Taxes
resulting therefrom, nor shall the Sellers be required to take any action
pursuant to this Section 10.15 that would delay the Closing. Prior to the date
of the Auction, the Purchaser shall notify the Sellers of its election or
non-election to enter into one or more Acquisition Agreements and, if
applicable, the structure of the acquisition of the Foreign Subsidiaries.

          Section 10.16.   NON-SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AND
CERTAIN COVENANTS. None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and none of the covenants contained in this Agreement which are
required by their terms to be performed prior to the Closing shall survive the
Closing.

                              POLAROID CORPORATION

                               BIDDING PROCEDURES

     Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "BIDDING PROCEDURES") to be
employed with respect to the transactions (collectively, the "TRANSACTIONS")
contemplated by the asset purchase agreement (the "AGREEMENT")(1) by and among
OEP Imaging Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "PROPOSED PURCHASER"),
Polaroid Corporation, a Delaware corporation and its Subsidiaries (as herein
defined) listed on the signature pages of the Agreement (collectively, the
"SELLERS") concerning the prospective sale (the "SALE") of substantially all of
the Acquired Assets (defined below). The Sellers will seek entry of an order
from the Bankruptcy Court authorizing and approving the Sale to a Qualified
Bidder (as hereinafter defined) which the Sellers, upon consultation with
counsel to the official committee of unsecured creditors (the "COMMITTEE"),
counsel for the Agent for the prepetition secured lenders (the "PREPETITION
LENDERS") and counsel for the Agent for the postpetition secured lenders (the
"POSTPETITION LENDERS," and together with the Prepetition Lenders, the
"LENDERS") may determine to have made the highest or otherwise best offer (the
"SUCCESSFUL BIDDER"). These Bidding Procedures shall not be subject to change
without the consent of the Proposed Purchaser and (i) approval of the Bankruptcy
Court or (ii) absent such approval, agreement among the Sellers, the Committee,
and the Agent for the Lenders.

                                ASSETS TO BE SOLD

     The Sellers are offering for sale substantially all of the assets of the
Sellers and certain of their subsidiaries, as more fully described in the
Agreement (the "ACQUIRED ASSETS"). Except as otherwise provided in the
Agreement, all of the Sellers' right, title and interest in and to the Acquired
Assets shall be sold free and clear of all pledges, liens, security interests,
encumbrances, claims, charges, options, and interests thereon and there against
(collectively, the "INTERESTS") in accordance with Section 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code, with such Interests to attach to the net proceeds of the sale of the
Acquired Assets.

                               THE BIDDING PROCESS

     The Sellers, in consultation with counsel to the Committee and the Agent
for the Lenders, shall (i) determine whether any person is a Qualified Bidder,
(ii) coordinate the efforts of Qualified Bidders in conducting their due
diligence investigations, (iii) receive offers from Qualified Bidders, and (iv)
negotiate any offers made to purchase the Acquired Assets (collectively, the
"BIDDING PROCESS"). Any person who wishes to participate in the Bidding Process
must be a Qualified Bidder. Neither the Sellers nor their representatives shall
be obligated to furnish any information of any kind whatsoever to any person who
is not determined to be a Qualified Bidder other than the Committee and the
Agent for the Lenders, both of which shall be given all relevant information
pertaining to the Sale. For purposes of submitting a bid,

--------
(1)  All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
     ascribed to them in the Agreement.

<Page>

the Committee shall be deemed a Qualified Bidder with respect to the Bidding
Procedures and the Auction.

                           PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS

     In order to participate in the Bidding Process each person (a "POTENTIAL
BIDDER"), other than the Proposed Purchaser or the Committee, must deliver
(unless previously delivered) to the Sellers:

          (i)     An executed confidentiality agreement in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the Sellers; and

          (ii)    Current audited financial statements of the Potential Bidder,
                  or, if the Potential Bidder is an entity formed for the
                  purpose of acquiring the Acquired Assets, current audited
                  financial statements of the equity holder(s) of the Potential
                  Bidder, or such other form of financial disclosure acceptable
                  to the Sellers and their advisors, the Committee and the Agent
                  for the Lenders demonstrating such Potential Bidder's ability
                  to close a proposed transaction.

     A Qualified Bidder is a Potential Bidder that timely delivers the documents
described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii), whose financial information
demonstrates the financial capability of the Potential Bidder to consummate the
Sale, and that the Sellers, in consultation with counsel to the Committee and
the Agent for the Lenders, determines is reasonably likely (based on
availability of financing, experience and other considerations) to submit a bona
fide offer and to be able to consummate the Sale if selected as the Successful
Bidder.

     Within two business days after a Potential Bidder delivers all of the
materials required by subparagraphs (i) and (ii) above, the Sellers, in
consultation with counsel to the Committee and the Agent for the Lenders, shall
determine, and shall notify the Potential Bidder, if such Potential Bidder is a
Qualified Bidder.

                                  DUE DILIGENCE

     The Sellers may afford any Qualified Bidder the opportunity to conduct a
due diligence review. The Sellers will designate an employee or other
representative to coordinate all reasonable requests for additional information
and due diligence access from Qualified Bidders. The Sellers shall not be
obligated to furnish any due diligence information after the Bid Deadline (as
hereinafter defined). Neither the Sellers nor any of their respective
representatives are obligated to furnish any information to any person. Bidders
are advised to exercise their own discretion before relying on any information
provided by anyone other than the Sellers or their representatives.

     Each bidder shall be deemed to acknowledge and represent that it has had an
opportunity to conduct any and all due diligence regarding the Acquired Assets
prior to making its offer, that it has relied solely upon its own independent
review, investigation and/or inspection of any documents and/or the Acquired
Assets in making its bid, and that it did not rely upon any written or oral
statements, representations, promises, warranties or guaranties whatsoever,
whether

                                       M-2

express, implied, by operation of law or otherwise, regarding the Acquired
Assets, or the completeness of any information provided in connection therewith
or the Auction, except as expressly stated in these Bidding Procedures or, as to
the Successful Bidders, the Agreement.

                                  BID DEADLINE

          A Qualified Bidder who desires to make a bid shall deliver a written

                                BID REQUIREMENTS

     All bids must include the following documents (the "REQUIRED BID
DOCUMENTS"):

          -       A letter stating that the bidder's offer is irrevocable until
                  the later of (x) 2 business days after the Acquired Assets
                  have been disposed of pursuant to these Bidding Procedures,
                  and (y) 30 days after the Sale Hearing.

          -       A good faith deposit (the "GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT") in the form of

                  their sole discretion) payable to the order of the Sellers (or
                  such other party as the Sellers may determine) in an amount
                  equal to ten million dollars ($10,000,000).

          -       Written evidence of a commitment for financing or other

          -       A statement by each Qualified Bidder identifying which

                  in connection with the Transactions.

                                       M-3
<Page>

          -       A statement by each Qualified Bidder indicating whether such
                  Qualified Bidder would agree to sponsor a certain Medicare
                  supplement health insurance implemented by Polaroid
                  Corporation in October 2001, underwritten by Hartford Life
                  Insurance Company, and administered by Americana Financial
                  Group.

A bid will be considered only if the bid (i) is on terms and conditions (other
than the amount of the consideration and the particular liabilities being
assumed) that are substantially similar to, and are not materially more
burdensome or conditional than, those contained in the Agreement, (ii) is not
conditioned on obtaining financing or on the outcome of unperformed due
diligence by the bidder, (iii) offers consideration of a value at least
$6,000,000 in excess of the Consideration proposed by the Proposed Purchaser in
the Agreement, (iv) is not conditioned upon the Bankruptcy Court's approval of
any bid protections, such as a break-up fee, termination fee, expense
reimbursement, or similar type of payment; (v) acknowledges and represents that
the bidder (X) has had an opportunity to conduct any and all due diligence
regarding the Acquired Assets prior to making its offer, (Y) has relied solely
upon its own independent review, investigation, and/or inspection of any
documents and/or the Acquired Assets in making its bid, and (Z) did not rely
upon any written or oral statements, representations, promises, warranties, or
guaranties whatsoever, whether express, implied, by operation of law or
otherwise, regarding the Acquired Assets, or the completeness of any information
provided in connection therewith or the Auction, except as expressly stated in
these Bidding Procedures, and (vi) is received by the Bid Deadline. A bid
received from a Qualified Bidder will constitute a "QUALIFIED BID" only if it
includes all of the Required Bid Documents and meets all of the above
requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Proposed Purchaser shall be
deemed a Qualified Bidder, and the Agreement shall be deemed a Qualified Bid,
for all purposes in connection with the bidding process, the Auction, and the
Sale.

                                 BID PROTECTION

     Recognizing the Proposed Purchaser's expenditure of time, energy, and
resources, the Sellers have agreed to provide certain bidding protections to the
Proposed Purchaser. Specifically, the Sellers have determined that the Agreement
will further the goals of the Bidding Procedures by setting a floor for which
all other Potential Bids must exceed and, therefore, is entitled to be selected
as a "STALKING HORSE BID." As a result, the Sellers have agreed that if the
Proposed Purchaser is not the Successful Bidder, they shall, in certain
circumstances, pay to the Proposed Purchaser a break-up fee equal to $5,000,000
(the "TERMINATION PAYMENT"). In the event the Agreement is terminated pursuant
to certain provisions thereof, then the Sellers shall be obligated to pay the
Proposed Purchaser's reasonable fees and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expenses of its financial advisors, and
expenses of other consultants) incurred in connection with the Transactions
contemplated by the Agreement (the "EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT"). The payment of the
Termination Payment or the Expense Reimbursement (as applicable) shall be
governed by the provisions of the Agreement and the Order of the Bankruptcy
Court approving the Bidding Procedures.

                                     AUCTION

     After all Qualified Bids have been received, the Sellers shall conduct an
auction (the "AUCTION") with respect to the Acquired Assets. Prior to the
Auction, the Sellers will give the Proposed Purchaser and all other Qualified
Bidders a copy of what they believe to be the highest and best Qualified Bid
received. The Proposed Purchaser and other parties-in-interest may seek review
by the Bankruptcy Court of the determination by the Sellers whether a bidder is
a Qualified Bidder.

     The Auction shall commence at 9:00 a.m. (prevailing Eastern time) on June
26, 2002, at the New York offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP,
or such later time or other place as agreed by the Proposed Purchaser and the
Sellers, after consultation with counsel to the Committee and the Agent for the
Lenders, and which the Sellers shall notify all Qualified Bidders who have
submitted Qualified Bids. Only a Qualified Bidder who has submitted a Qualified
Bid as determined by the Sellers after consultation with the Committee and the
Agent for the Lenders or as determined by the Court after a disagreement between
the Sellers and the Committee or the Agent for the Lenders is eligible to
participate at the Auction. During the Auction, bidding shall begin initially
with the highest Qualified Bid (taking into account the Termination Payment) and
subsequently continue in minimum increments of at least $1,000,000 higher than
the previous bid.

     Upon conclusion of the Auction, the Sellers, in consultation with (a) their
financial and business advisors and (b) representatives of the Agent for the
Lenders and the Committee, shall (i) review each Qualified Bid or Bids on the
basis of financial and contractual terms and the factors relevant to the sale
process, including those factors affecting the speed and certainty of
consummating the Sale, and (ii) identify the highest and otherwise best offer
for the Acquired Assets (the "SUCCESSFUL BID"), which highest and best offer
will provide the largest amount of net value to the Sellers after payment of,
among other things, the Termination Payment, if necessary.

                          ACCEPTANCE OF QUALIFIED BIDS

     The Sellers shall sell the Acquired Assets for the highest or otherwise
best Qualified Bid received at the Auction upon the approval of such Qualified
Bid by the Bankruptcy Court after the hearing (the "SALE HEARING"). If, after an
Auction in which the Proposed Purchaser (i) shall have bid an amount in excess
of the consideration presently provided for in the Agreement with respect to the
Transactions and (ii) is the Successful Bidder, it shall, at the Closing under
the Agreement, pay, in full satisfaction of the Successful Bid, an amount equal
to (a) the amount of the Successful Bid less (b) the $5,000,000 Termination
Payment.

     The Sellers' presentation of a particular Qualified Bid to the Bankruptcy
Court for approval does not constitute the Sellers' acceptance of the bid. The
Sellers will be deemed to have accepted a bid only when the bid has been
approved by the Bankruptcy Court at the Sale Hearing. The Proposed Purchaser and
other parties-in-interest may seek review by the Bankruptcy Court of the
determination by the Sellers of the highest and best Qualified Bid or whether a
bidder is a Qualified Bidder.

                                  SALE HEARING

     The Sale Hearing will be held before the Honorable Peter J. Walsh on June
28, 2002 at 9:00 a.m. (prevailing Eastern time) at the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the District of Delaware, located in Wilmington, Delaware, but may be
adjourned or rescheduled without further notice by an announcement of the
adjourned date at the Sale Hearing. At the Sale Hearing, the Sellers shall seek
entry of an order, INTER ALIA, authorizing and approving the Sale (i) if no
other Qualified Bid is received, to the Proposed Purchaser pursuant to the terms
and conditions set forth in the Agreement or (ii) if a Qualified Bidder other
than the Proposed Purchaser submits the Successful Bid, to the maker of such
Successful Bid.

     Following the Sale Hearing approving the sale of the Acquired Assets to the
Successful Bidder, if such Successful Bidder fails to consummate an approved
sale because of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such Successful
Bidder, the next highest or otherwise best Qualified Bid, as disclosed at the
Sale Hearing, shall be deemed to be the Successful Bid and the Sellers shall be
authorized, but not required, to consummate the sale with the Qualified Bidder
submitting such bid without further order of the Bankruptcy Court.

                          RETURN OF GOOD FAITH DEPOSIT

     Good Faith Deposits of all Qualified Bidders (except for the Successful
Bidder) shall be held in an interest-bearing escrow account until two (2) days
following the Auction. If a Successful Bidder fails to consummate an approved
sale because of a breach or failure to perform on the part of such Successful
Bidder, the Sellers will not have any obligation to return the Good Faith
Deposit deposited by such Successful Bidder, and such Good Faith Deposit shall
irrevocably become property of the Sellers. The treatment of the Deposit Amount
provided by the Proposed Purchaser under the Agreement shall be governed by the
provisions of the Agreement.

                                  MODIFICATIONS

     The Sellers, after consultation with the Agents for the Lenders and the
Committee, (a) may determine, which Qualified Bid, if any, is the highest or
otherwise best offer, and (b) shall reject at any time before entry of an order
of the Bankruptcy Court approving a Qualified Bid, any bid (other than the
Proposed Purchaser's bid) that is (i) inadequate or insufficient, (ii) not in
conformity with the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bidding Procedures,
or the terms and conditions of sale, or (iii) contrary to the best interests of
the Sellers, their estates, and creditors. At or before the Sale Hearing, the
Sellers, after consultation with the Agent for the Lenders and the Committee,
may impose such other terms and conditions on Qualified Bidders (other than the
Proposed Purchaser) as it may determine to be in the best interests of the
Sellers' estate, their creditors, and other parties-in-interest herein.
