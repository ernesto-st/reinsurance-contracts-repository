written consent of Administrative Agent, further pledge, transfer, deliver, assign or grant any
security interest in the Interest Rate Cap Agreement (or, when and if any such agreement becomes

Financing Statements or any other notice or instrument as may be required under the UCC, as

one-twelfth of the annual Impositions that Administrative Agent reasonably estimates, based on the

evidence such attornment. Upon such attornment, the Lease shall continue in full force and effect
as, or as if it were, a direct lease between Successor-Landlord and Tenant upon all terms,

operation of law or otherwise as a result of or in connection with a bankruptcy case commenced by
or against Landlord or a foreclosure action or proceeding or delivery of a deed in lieu, upon
