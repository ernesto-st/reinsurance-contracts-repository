          portions  thereof,  the  portions  thereof  to  be  allocated  to each
          resulting  Borrowing  (in  which  case the information to be specified
          pursuant  to  clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each
          resulting  Borrowing);

               (ii)  the  effective  date  of the election made pursuant to such
          Interest  Election  Request,  which  shall  be  a  Business  Day;

               (iii)  whether  the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing
          or  a  Eurodollar  Borrowing;  and

               (iv)  if  the  resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the
          Interest  Period  to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such
          election,  which  shall  be a period contemplated by the definition of
          the  term  "Interest  Period".

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.


<PAGE>
          (d)     Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request,
the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of
such Lender's portion of each resulting Borrowing.

          (e)     If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election
Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided
herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to
an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the
request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an
Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to
or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

          SECTION 2.03.     Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.  (a) The
                            -------------------------------------
Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Loan of such
Lender as provided in Section 2.04.

          (b)     Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts
of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

          (c)     The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and
the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each
Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender's share thereof.

          (d)     The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
                                              ----- -----
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein, provided that the
                                                           --------
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e)     Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note.  In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a
form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by
such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after
assignment pursuant to Section 9.04) be represented by one or more promissory
notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such


<PAGE>
promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).

          SECTION 2.04.     Amortization of Loans.  (a) Subject to adjustment
                            ----------------------
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section, the Borrower shall repay Borrowings
on each date set forth below in the aggregate principal amount set forth
opposite such date:

          (b)     To the extent not previously paid, all Loans shall be due and
payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

          (c)     Any prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied to reduce the
subsequent scheduled repayments of the Borrowings to be made pursuant to this
Section ratably.

          (d)     Prior to any repayment of any Borrowings hereunder, the
Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be repaid and shall notify
the Administrative Agent by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such selection
not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Business Days before the
scheduled date of such repayment.  Each repayment of a Borrowing shall be
applied ratably to the Loans included in the repaid Borrowing.  Repayments of
Borrowings shall be accompanied by accrued interest on the amount repaid.


<PAGE>
          SECTION 2.05.     Prepayment of Loans.  (a) The Borrower shall have
                            --------------------
the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or
in part, subject to the requirements of this Section.

          (b)     In the event and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are
received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any
Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, immediately after such Net Proceeds are
received, prepay Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to (i) in the case of
any event described in clause (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of the term
"Prepayment Event", 75% of such Net Proceeds and (ii) in the case of any event
described in clause (d) of the definition of the term "Prepayment Event", 100%
of such Net Proceeds, provided that, in the case of any event described in
                      --------
clause (a) or (b) of the definition of the term "Prepayment Event", if the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial
Officer to the effect that the Borrower and the Subsidiaries intend to apply the
Net Proceeds from such event (or a portion thereof specified in such
certificate), within 120 days after receipt of such Net Proceeds, to acquire
real property, equipment, other tangible assets, patents or trademarks to be
used in the business of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries, and certifying that
no Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be required
pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Proceeds in respect of such
event (or the portion of such Net Proceeds specified in such certificate, if
applicable) except to the extent of any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have
not been so applied by the end of such 120-day period, at which time a
prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to such Net Proceeds that have
not been so applied; provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be permitted
                     --------  -------
to make elections pursuant to the immediately preceding proviso with respect to
Net Proceeds in any fiscal year aggregating in excess of $3,000,000.

          (c)     Following the end of each fiscal year of the Borrower,
commencing with the fiscal year ending 2003, the Borrower shall prepay
Borrowings in an aggregate amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such
fiscal year.  Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made not later
than 10 days following the date on which financial statements are delivered
pursuant to Section 5.01 with respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash
Flow is being calculated (and in any event within 100 days after the end of such
fiscal year).

          (d)     Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings
hereunder, the Borrower shall select the Borrowing or Borrowings to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section.

          (e)     The Borrower shall notify the Administrative  Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of
prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City
time, three Business Days before the date of prepayment or (ii) in the case of
prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time,
one Business Day before the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall specify
the prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof
to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed


<PAGE>
calculation of the amount of such prepayment.  Each such notice shall be
irrevocable, provided that a notice of prepayment may state that such notice is
             --------
conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case
such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative
Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not
satisfied.  Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment
of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of a
continuation or conversion of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in
Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a
mandatory prepayment.  Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably
to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing.  Prepayments shall be
accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.07.

          SECTION 2.06.     Fees.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the
                            -----
Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at
the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent.

          SECTION 2.07.     Interest.  (a) The Loans comprising each ABR
                            ---------
Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable
Rate.

          (b)     The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

          (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the
rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs
of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate
applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section.

          (d)     Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date for such Loan, provided that (i) interest accrued
                                          --------
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Eurodollar Loan, accrued
interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date
of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor,
accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such
conversion.

          (e)     All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate
Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall
be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate


<PAGE>
or Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

          SECTION 2.08.     Alternate Rate of Interest.  If prior to the
                            ---------------------------
commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing:

          (a)     the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall
     be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do
     not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period;
     or

          (b)     the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders
     that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately
     and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their
     Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and,
until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the
circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective
and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such
Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing.

          SECTION 2.09.     Increased Costs.  (a) If any Change in Law shall:
                            ----------------

          (i)     impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit
     or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account
     of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement
     reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

          (ii)     impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other
     condition affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or
otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, as the case may be,
for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

          (b)     If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, if
any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such Lender to a
level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's
policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender


<PAGE>
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

          (c)     A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be,
as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 Business
Days after receipt thereof.

          (d)     Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not
                                            --------
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such
Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided, further, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
          --------  -------
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

          SECTION 2.10.     Break Funding Payments.  In the event of (a) the
                            -----------------------
payment of any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to convert, continue
or prepay any Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto
(regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.05(e) and is
revoked in accordance therewith), or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.13, then, in any such event,
the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event.  In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such loss, cost
or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such
Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that would have
accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period
from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period
therefor (or, in the case of a failure to convert or continue, for the period
that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of
interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the
interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of
such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable amount and period from other
banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any
amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on
any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

          SECTION 2.11.     Taxes.  (a) Any and all payments by or on account of
                            ------
any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or


<PAGE>
Other Taxes, provided that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any
             --------
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
the Administrative Agent or Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal
to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the
Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

          (b)     In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

          (c)     The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent and each
Lender within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account
of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document
(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

          (d)     As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

          (e)     Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable
law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable
law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate, provided that such Foreign Lender
                                               --------
has received written notice from the Borrower advising it of the availability of
such exemption or reduction and supplying all applicable documentation.

          SECTION 2.12.     Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of
                            --------------------------------------------------
Set-offs.  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it
---------
hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest,
fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.09, 2.10 or 2.11, or otherwise) not


<PAGE>
later than the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan
Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, not later
than 12:00 noon, New York City time), on the date when due, in immediately
available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after
such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be
deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the
Administrative Agent at its offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York,
except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.09, 2.10, 2.11 and 9.03 shall be
made directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other
Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein.  The
Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate Person promptly following receipt
thereof.  If any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is
not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest,
interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All
payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars.

          (b)     If at any time insufficient funds are received by and
available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first,
towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees
then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of principal then due to such parties.

          (c)     If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest
thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Loans, provided that (i) if any such participations are
                        --------
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or
participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  The Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.


<PAGE>
          (d)     Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower
will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In
such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the
Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent
in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.

          (e)     If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be
made by it pursuant to Section 2.09 or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent
may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply
any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all
such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

          SECTION 2.13.     Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.  (a)
                            -----------------------------------------------
If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.09, or if the Borrower is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11, then such
Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for
funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations
hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the
reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would
eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.09 or 2.11, as the
case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.

          (b)     If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.09, or if
the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.11,
or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the
Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the
Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in
Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to
an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that (i) the Borrower
                                              --------
shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued
interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii)


<PAGE>
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 2.09 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.09, such
assignment will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

                                   ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

          The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lenders that:

          SECTION 3.01.     Organization; Powers.  Each of the Borrower and the
                            ---------------------
Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, has all requisite power and
authority to carry on its business as now conducted and, except where the

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, is qualified to do business in,
and is in good standing in, every jurisdiction where such qualification is
required.

          SECTION 3.02.     Authorization; Enforceability.  The Transactions
                            ------------------------------

Party's corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and
constitutes, and each other Loan Document to which any Loan Party is to be a
party, when executed and delivered by such Loan Party, will constitute, a legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Borrower or such Loan Party (as the case may
be), enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity, regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

          SECTION 3.03.     Governmental Approvals; No Conflicts.  The
                            -------------------------------------

filing with, or any other action by or before, any Governmental Authority,

other instrument binding upon the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries or any of
their assets, or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be
made by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, and (d) will not result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any of the
Subsidiaries, except (x) Liens created under the Loan Documents and (y) Liens


<PAGE>
permitted by Section 6.02.  The Orders (i) are in full force and effect and (ii)
are not subject to any stay, reversal, modification or vacatur, in whole or in
part.

          SECTION 3.04.     Financial Condition; No Material Adverse Change.

in accordance with GAAP, subject to year-end audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes in the case of the statements referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii)
above.

          (b)     The Borrower has heretofore furnished to the Lenders its pro

otherwise) liabilities (including contingent liabilities) or prospects of the
Borrower and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than any material adverse
change disclosed (i) in the Emergence Plan or the Disclosure Statement or (ii)
on Schedule 4.01(bb).

          SECTION 3.05.     Properties.  (a) Each of the Borrower and the

Subsidiaries has good title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its real

ability to conduct its business as currently conducted or to utilize such
properties for their intended purposes.

          (b)     Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries owns, or is licensed
to use, all trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents and other intellectual


<PAGE>
property material to its business, and the use thereof by the Borrower and the
Subsidiaries does not infringe upon the rights of any other Person, except for
any such infringements that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          (c)     Schedule 3.05 sets forth the address of each real property
that is owned or leased by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Date after giving effect to the Transactions.

          (d)     As of the Effective Date, none of the Borrower or the
Subsidiaries has received notice of, or has knowledge of, any pending or
contemplated condemnation proceeding affecting any Mortgaged Property or any
sale or disposition thereof in lieu of condemnation.  Neither any Mortgaged
Property nor any interest therein is subject to any right of first refusal,
option or other contractual right to purchase any such Mortgaged Property or
interest therein.

          SECTION 3.06.     Litigation and Environmental Matters.  (a) There are
                            -------------------------------------
no actions, suits or proceedings by or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority pending against or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened
against or affecting the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries (i) as to which
there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse determination and that, if
adversely determined, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse Effect (other than the Disclosed
Matters) or (ii) that involve any of the Loan Documents or the Transactions.

          (b)     Except for the Disclosed Matters and except with respect to
any other matters that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, none of the Borrower or the
Subsidiaries (i) has failed to comply with any Environmental Law or to obtain,
maintain or comply with any permit, license or other approval required under any
Environmental Law, (ii) has become subject to any Environmental Liability, (iii)
has received any request for information pursuant to any Environmental Law or
notice of any claim with respect to any Environmental Liability or (iv) knows of
any basis for any Environmental Liability.

          (c)     Since the Effective Date, there has been no change in the
status of the Disclosed Matters that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted in, or materially increased the likelihood of, a Material Adverse
Effect.

          SECTION 3.07.     Compliance with Laws and Agreements.  Each of the
                            ------------------------------------
Borrower and the Subsidiaries is in compliance with all material laws,
regulations and orders of any arbitrator or Governmental Authority applicable to
it or its property and all indentures, agreements and other instruments binding
upon it or its property.  No Default has occurred and is continuing.

          SECTION 3.08.     Investment and Holding Company Status.  None of the
                            --------------------------------------
Borrower or the Subsidiary Loan Parties is (a) an "investment company" as
defined in, or subject to regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940


<PAGE>
or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under, the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

          SECTION 3.09.     Taxes.  Each of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
                            ------
has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports required to
have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid all Taxes required to have
been paid by it, except (a) any Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as
applicable, has set aside on its books adequate reserves or (b) to the extent
that the failure to do so could not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.10.     ERISA.  Except as set forth on Schedule 3.10, no
                            ------
ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur that, when taken
together with all other ERISA Events that have occurred, could reasonably be
expected to result in liability of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries in an
aggregate amount exceeding (i) $3,000,000 in any year or (ii) $5,000,000 in all
periods.  The present value of all accumulated benefit obligations under each
Plan (based on the assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 87) did not, as of the date of the most recent
financial statements reflecting such amounts, exceed by more than $35,000,000
the fair market value of the assets of such Plan, and the present value of all
accumulated benefit obligations of all underfunded Plans (based on the
assumptions used for purposes of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
87) did not, as of the date of the most recent financial statements reflecting
such amounts, exceed by more than $35,000,000 the fair market value of the
assets of all such underfunded Plans.

          SECTION 3.11.     Disclosure.  The Borrower has disclosed to the
                            -----------
Lenders (or disclosed in a filing with the Court prior to the date hereof) all
agreements, instruments and corporate or other restrictions to which the
Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries is subject, and all matters known to any of
them, that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Disclosure Statement nor the
reports, financial statements, certificates or other information furnished,
taken as a whole, by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent
or any Lender in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or delivered hereunder or thereunder (as modified or supplemented
by other information so furnished) contains any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
provided that, with respect to projected financial information the Borrower
--------
represents only that such information was prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time.

          SECTION 3.12.     Subsidiaries.  Schedule 3.12 sets forth the name of,
                            -------------
and the ownership interest of the Borrower in, each Subsidiary and identifies
each Subsidiary that is a Subsidiary Loan Party, in each case as of the
Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.13.     Insurance.  Schedule 3.13 sets forth a description
                            ----------
of all insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Date.  As of the Effective Date, all premiums in respect of


<PAGE>
such insurance have been paid.  The Borrower believes that the insurance
maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries is adequate.

          SECTION 3.14.     Labor Matters.  As of the Effective Date, there are
                            --------------
no strikes, lockouts or slowdowns against the Borrower or any Subsidiary pending
or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened.  The hours worked by and
payments made to employees of the Borrower and the Subsidiaries have not been in
violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other applicable Federal,
state, local or foreign law dealing with such matters.  All payments due from
the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or for which any claim may be made against the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, on account of wages and employee health and welfare
insurance and other benefits, have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the Borrower or such Subsidiary.  The consummation of the Transactions
will not give rise to any right of termination or right of renegotiation on the
part of any union under any collective bargaining agreement to which the
Borrower or any Subsidiary is bound.

          SECTION 3.15.     Solvency.  On the Effective Date and at all times
                            ---------
thereafter, (a) the fair value of the assets of (i) the Borrower, (ii) World
Kitchen, Inc. and (iii) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis, at a fair
valuation, will exceed its or their debts and liabilities, subordinated,
contingent or otherwise; (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of
(i) the Borrower, (ii) World Kitchen, Inc. and (iii) the Loan Parties, on a
consolidated basis, will be greater than the amount that it or they will be
required to pay the probable liability of its debts and other liabilities,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities
become absolute and matured; (c) (i) the Borrower, (ii) World Kitchen, Inc. and
(iii) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis, will be able to pay its or
their debts and liabilities, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such
debts and liabilities become absolute and matured; and (d) (i) the Borrower,
(ii) World Kitchen, Inc. and (iii) the Loan Parties, on a consolidated basis,
will not have unreasonably small capital with which to conduct the business in
which it or they are engaged as such business is now conducted and is proposed
to be conducted following the Effective Date.

          SECTION 3.16.     Security Documents.  (a) The Collateral Agreement is
                            -------------------
effective to create, for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Obligations,
a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral (as defined
in the Collateral Agreement) and, when such Collateral is delivered to the
Collateral Agent and for so long as the Collateral Agent remains in possession
of such Collateral or when financing statements in appropriate form are filed in
the offices specified in the Perfection Certificate, as applicable, the security
interest created by the Collateral Agreement shall constitute a perfected first
priority security interest in all right, title and interest of the pledgor
thereunder in such Collateral, in each case prior and superior in right to any
other Person, other than with respect to the rights of Persons pursuant to Liens
permitted by Section 6.02.

          (b)     The Mortgages are effective to create, subject to the
exceptions listed in each title insurance policy covering such Mortgage, for the
ratable benefit of the holders of the Obligations, a legal, valid and


<PAGE>
enforceable Lien on all the applicable mortgagor's right, title and interest in
and to the Mortgaged Properties thereunder, and when the Mortgages are filed in
the offices specified in the Perfection Certificate, the Lien created by each
Mortgage shall constitute a perfected Lien on all right, title and interest of
the applicable mortgagor in such Mortgaged Properties, in each case prior and
superior in right to any other Person, other than with respect to the rights of
Persons pursuant to Liens permitted by Section 6.02.

          SECTION 3.17.     Use of Proceeds.  The proceeds of the Loans are to
                            ----------------
be used solely for the purposes set forth in and permitted by Section 5.11.
None of the Borrower or the Subsidiaries is generally engaged in the business of
purchasing or selling Margin Stock or extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

                                   ARTICLE IV

          (a)     the Borrower shall fail to pay any principal of any Loan when

     this Article) payable under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, when


<PAGE>
     and as the same shall become due and payable, and such failure shall
     continue unremedied for a period of five days;

          (c)     any representation or warranty made or deemed made by or on
     behalf of the Borrower or any Subsidiary in or in connection with any Loan

          (f)     the Borrower or any Subsidiary shall fail to make any
     scheduled payment (whether of principal or interest and regardless of

     become due and payable;

          (g)     any event or condition occurs that results in any Material
     Indebtedness becoming due prior to its scheduled maturity or that enables
     or permits (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time or
     both) the holder or holders of any Material Indebtedness or any trustee or

     Subsidiary or any combination thereof and the same shall remain
     undischarged for a period of 30 consecutive days during which execution
     shall not be effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a
     judgment creditor to attach or levy upon any assets of the Borrower or any
     Subsidiary to enforce any such judgment;

          (l)     an ERISA Event shall have occurred that, in the opinion of the
     Required Lenders, when taken together with all other ERISA Events that have

     $3,000,000 in any year or (ii) $5,000,000 for all periods;

          (m)     (i) any Lien purported to be created under any Security
     Document shall cease to be, or shall be asserted by any Loan Party not to
     be, a valid and perfected Lien on any Collateral, with the priority
     required by the applicable Security Document, except (A) as a result of the
     sale or other disposition of the applicable Collateral in a transaction
     permitted under the Loan Documents or (B) as a result of the Collateral
     Agent's failure to maintain possession of any stock certificates,
     promissory notes or other instruments delivered to it under the Collateral

during the continuance of such event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the


<PAGE>
request of the Required Lenders shall, by notice to the Borrower, declare the
Loans then outstanding to be due and payable in whole (or in part, in which case
any principal not so declared to be due and payable may thereafter be declared
to be due and payable), and thereupon the principal of the Loans so declared to

other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall become due and
payable immediately, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any
kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower; and in case of any event
with respect to the Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of this Article, the
principal of the Loans then outstanding, together with accrued interest thereon
and all fees and other obligations of the Borrower accrued hereunder, shall
automatically become due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                The Administrative Agent and The Collateral Agent
                -------------------------------------------------

          Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative
Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions
on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such actions and powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto.

          The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the
same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.

          The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations
except those expressly set forth in the Loan Documents.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject
to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has
occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except
discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated by the Loan Documents
that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required
Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary
under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as
expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary that is communicated
to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for
any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the


<PAGE>
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence
of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written
notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender,
and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith, (iii)
the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms
or conditions set forth in any Loan Document, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of any Loan Document or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere in any Loan Document, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

          The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not
incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person.  The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

          The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and
exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent.  The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers
through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the
preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related
Parties of each Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.

          Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor the
Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may
resign at any time by notifying the Lenders and the Borrower.  Upon any such
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed
by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days
after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then
the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent which shall be a bank with an office in New York,
New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees
payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as


<PAGE>
those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower
and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the
provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

          Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or related agreement or any document furnished hereunder
or thereunder.

          The provisions of this Article applicable to the Administrative Agent
shall also be applicable to the Collateral Agent, mutatis mutandis.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  All notices and


<PAGE>
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of receipt.

          SECTION 9.02.     Waivers; Amendments.  (a) No failure or delay by the
                            --------------------
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender in exercising any right
or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or
any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power,
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to
any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless
the same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the
purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless
of whether the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may have
had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

          (b)     Neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are
parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders, provided
                                                                        --------
that no such agreement shall (i) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (ii) postpone the
final maturity of any Loan, or any date for the payment of any interest or fees
payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such scheduled
payment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iii)
change Section 2.12(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing
of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (iv)
change any of the provisions of this Section or the percentage set forth in the
definition of the term "Required Lenders" or any other provision of any Loan
Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend
or modify any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) release any
Subsidiary Loan Party from its Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except
as expressly provided in the Collateral Agreement), or limit its liability in
respect of such Guarantee, without the written consent of each Lender or (vi)
release all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents, without the written consent of each Lender; provided,
                                                                ---------
further that (A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the
-------
rights or duties of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as
the case may be.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement
may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower, the


<PAGE>
Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent if at the time such amendment
becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full
of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan made by it and all other
amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.03.     Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.  (a) The
                            -----------------------------------
Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and their respective Affiliates,
including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the
Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent, in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and
administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers

or thereby shall be consummated), (ii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Administrative Agent,  the Collateral Agent or any Lender, including the
fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or
any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in

engagement of Huntley, Mullaney & Spargo, LLC, pursuant to the Letter Agreement

          (b)     The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing
Persons (each such Person being called an "Indemnitee") against, and hold each
                                           ----------
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel
for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out
of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any
Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations
thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii)
any actual or alleged presence or Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
Mortgaged Property or any other property currently or formerly owned or operated
by the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability
related in any way to the Borrower or any of the Subsidiaries, or (iv) any
actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to
any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, provided that such
                                                         --------
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

          (c)     To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount
required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent as the case may be, such


<PAGE>
Lender's pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount,
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
--------
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent in its capacity as
such.  For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro rata share" shall be determined
based upon its share of the sum of the total Exposures at the time.

          (d)     To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall
not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby,
the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

          (e)     All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

          SECTION 9.04.     Successors and Assigns.  (a) The provisions of this
                            -----------------------
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to
confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent,
the Collateral Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (b)     Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of the Loans at the time owing to it), provided  that (i) except in the
                                               --------
case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund,
each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent must give their prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
(ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Loans,
the amount of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$1,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
consent, (iii) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, (iv) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to
the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $3,500, (v) the assignee, if it shall not be a
Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative
Questionnaire and (vi) in the case of an assignment to a CLO, the assigning


<PAGE>
Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided, in the case of this clause
                                           --------
(vi), that the Assignment and Acceptance between such Lender and such CLO may
provide that such Lender shall not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to
any amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
9.02(b) that affects such CLO; provided, further, that any consent of the
                               --------  -------
Borrower otherwise required under this paragraph shall not be required if a
Default has occurred and is continuing.  Subject to acceptance and recording
thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after the effective
date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee thereunder shall
be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09, 2.10, 2.11 and 9.03).  Any
assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement
that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and
obligations in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

          (c)     The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and principal amount of
the Loans and owing to each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to
time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, and the
           --------
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (d)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender
hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of
this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph
(b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and
Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register.  No
assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been
recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

          (e)     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a "Participant") in all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations
    -----------
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans owing to it),
provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
--------
unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties


<PAGE>
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents, provided that
                                                               --------
such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.09, 2.10 and 2.11 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.  To the extent permitted
by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08
as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to
                            --------
Section 2.12(c) as though it were a Lender.

          (f)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.09 or 2.11 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Borrower's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender
if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.11 unless
the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section
2.11(e) as though it were a Lender.

          (g)     Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure
obligations of such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest, provided that no such pledge
                                                  --------
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

          SECTION 9.05.     Survival.  All covenants, agreements,
                            ---------
representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents
and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to
have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and
issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any
such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative
Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid.  The provisions of Sections 2.09, 2.10,
2.11 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the


<PAGE>
repayment of the Loans or the termination of this Agreement or any provision
hereof.

          SECTION 9.06.     Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness.  This
                            -----------------------------------------
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract.  This Agreement,
the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the
parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof.  Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and the
Collateral Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of
this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.07.     Severability.  Any provision of this Agreement held
                            -------------
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

          SECTION 9.08.     Right of Setoff.  If an Event of Default shall have
                            ----------------
occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or
demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time
owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the
Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although
such obligations may be unmatured.  The rights of each Lender under this Section
are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff)
which such Lender may have.

          SECTION 9.09.     Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of
                            --------------------------------------------------
Process.  (a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed
--------
by the law of the State of New York.

          (b)     The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to any Loan Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and


<PAGE>
each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court.  Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any right that
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender may otherwise have
to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any
jurisdiction.

          (c)     The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section.  Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

          (d)     Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.01.  Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Loan Document will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

          SECTION 9.10.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
                            ---------------------
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN  ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

          SECTION 9.11.     Headings.  Article and Section headings and the
                            ---------
Table of Contents used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not
part of this Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken
into consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

          SECTION 9.12.     Confidentiality.  Each of the  Administrative Agent,
                            ----------------
the Collateral Agent, and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of

Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to any
assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of
the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes
available to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower.  For the purposes
of this Section, "Information" means all information received from the Borrower
                  -----------
relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that
is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower, provided that, in the case of
                                           --------
information received from the Borrower after the date hereof, such information
is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential.  Any Person
required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this
Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if

confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

          SECTION 9.13.     Interest Rate Limitation.  Notwithstanding anything
                            -------------------------
herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan,
together with all fees, charges and other amounts that are treated as interest
on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the
                                                     -------
maximum lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") that may be contracted for, charged,
                          ------------
taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder,
together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the
Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have
been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the
operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased
(but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together
with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of
repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

          SECTION 9.14.     Intercreditor Agreement.  Each Lender hereby
                            ------------------------
