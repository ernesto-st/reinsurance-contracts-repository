from a Tax or other perspective (including, without limitation, its effects on the likelihood of receiving necessary governmental approvals and of consummating the Transactions in the first quarter of 2005), and if such party determines that such
proposed structure is not so adverse to it, to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate with the other parties any amendment, supplement or modification to this Agreement required to implement such structure. </FONT></P> <P
