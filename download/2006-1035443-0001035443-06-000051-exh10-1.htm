breach or default; provided, however, nothing herein shall require Seller to expend in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars

limitation on Seller's reasonable efforts shall not apply to Seller's obligation to remove all voluntary monetary liens encumbering the

its obligations hereunder and satisfy all conditions of closing to be satisfied by Seller on or before the extended Closing Date, <FONT

an action for specific performance for conveyance of the Property on the terms set forth in this Contract, or (c) terminate this Contract
by written notice to Seller and receive a return of the Deposit.  In the event that Buyer's elects the remedy set forth in subsection (c),

Deposit, Seller shall be entitled to receive and retain the Deposit as and for Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for damages arising
from Buyer's failure to complete the acquisition in accordance with the terms hereof, and Seller shall have no further recourse or
remedy at law or in equity for any breach by Buyer hereunder.</P>

obtained a final decision on July 9, 1999 from the Parking and Transportation Demand Management Planning Officer of the City of
Cambridge approving a Parking and Transportation Demand Management Plan (the "<U>PTDM</U>").  The IPOP and the PTDM
impose requirements upon the Seller with respect to ongoing operations at the Premises.  Seller hereby advises Buyer that provisions
of the IPOP and the PTDM are general in nature, subject to interpretation and with respect to which literal compliance may not be
possible or appropriate.  Buyer hereby agrees that, effective as of Closing, it shall assume full responsibility for all operating obligations

Kendall Square Garage, formerly owned by an affiliate of Beacon Capital Partners, Inc., or a garage no further away from the Premises
than the One Kendall Square Garage.  Pursuant to that requirement, One Kendall LLC, the former owner of the garage, entered into a
license agreement with Forrester Research, Inc.  In addition, One Kendall LLC and Seller's predecessor-in-interest entered into a
license agreement (the "<U>Kendall License</U>").  True and complete copies of both licenses have been provided to Buyer.  Buyer
hereby agrees to assume all obligations of Seller under the Kendall License.</A></P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.3 &nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Sewer Encroachment</U>.  Seller hereby advises Buyer that a sewer easement in favor of the City of

agrees to cooperate with Seller, in such manner as Seller may reasonably request (e.g. by providing information about the entity which

from its obligations under the Steam Contract. </P>

Due Diligence Period, that any of Seller's representations or warranties in Article 13 or elsewhere are inaccurate, untrue or incorrect in
any way, such representations and warranties shall be deemed modified to reflect Buyer's knowledge or deemed knowledge, as the
case may be.  For purposes of this Contract, Buyer shall be "deemed to know" that a representation or warranty was untrue, inaccurate
or incorrect to the extent that a representation or warranty of Seller was qualified by information contained in the Due Diligence Items
pursuant to Section 12.1, this Contract, any exhibits attached hereto, any estoppel certificate delivered in connection herewith or any
studies, tests, reports, or analyses prepared by or for Buyer or any of its employees, agents, representatives or attorneys (all of the

Representatives and actually known by Thomas Andrews to contain information which is inconsistent with such representation or

(as modified or qualified pursuant hereto), and then only to the extent of the actual damages incurred by Buyer or, subject to the
provisions of Section 23.2 hereof, its assigns, in excess of Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00) per occurrence.  In addition,
the maximum aggregate liability of Seller and the maximum aggregate amount which may be awarded to and collected by Buyer or
Buyer's assigns for all breaches of the representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section 12.1 shall in no event exceed the
lesser of (a) the actual direct damages proximately caused by any such breaches by Seller, or (b) Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($7,500,000.00).  Other than Seller's representations and warranties contained in Section 12.1 hereof and in any
Seller Estoppel Certificates and Seller Development Contract Estoppel Letters, and other than Seller's obligations to make post-Closing
adjustments under Article 15 hereof, Buyer's acceptance and recording of the Lease Assignment shall be deemed full compliance by
Seller of all of its obligations hereunder.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">13.4 &nbsp;&nbsp; <U>Release as of Closing Date</U>.  Buyer, for itself and its successors and assigns hereby releases and

which occur prior to Closing, (ii) Seller's liability under any Seller Estoppel Certificates or Seller Development Contract Estoppel Letters

not known at the Closing, such taxes shall be apportioned on the basis of the taxes assessed for the preceding tax period, with a
reapportionment as soon as the new tax rate and valuation can be ascertained and if the taxes which are to be apportioned shall

(short of commencing litigation or terminating any lease) to collect such rents as are delinquent at the time of Closing and Seller shall
not have any rights to take any action to collect such rents, (ii) any such rents shall be adjusted between Seller and Buyer as and when
collected, and (iii) any rents collected after the Closing by Buyer shall be applied first, to rents then due from and after the Closing until

respect of the reimbursement of taxes or operating expenses, percentage rent or the like which relate to a period which falls partly prior
to the Closing and partly subsequent thereto shall be adjusted on a pro-rata per diem basis as and when collected by either party;
provided that Buyer shall submit to Seller for approval the year-end calculations prior to submitting the same to tenants.  Buyer shall
receive a credit for all cash security deposits then held by Seller and in such event Buyer shall assume all of Seller's obligations to
repay such security deposits to tenants.  With respect to any security deposits which are letters of credit, Seller shall, if the same are
assignable, deliver to Buyer at Closing such original letters of credit and shall execute and deliver such other instruments as the
issuer(s) thereof shall reasonably require to assign such letters of credit to Buyer.  Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to change the
name of the beneficiary under such letters of credit at Buyer's cost.  The provisions of this Section 15.2 shall survive Closing for twelve

shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the Closing based on estimates of the amounts that will be due and payable on the
next payment date, unless final invoices therefor as of the Closing shall have been obtained, in which case such final invoices shall be
utilized as the basis for adjustment.  As soon as the amount of such expenses for the period shall be known, Seller and Buyer shall
recalculate the foregoing adjustments with the result that Seller shall pay for those expenses attributable to the period of time prior to
the Closing Date and Buyer shall pay for those expenses attributable to the period of time commencing with the Closing Date.  Any and
all deposits held by utility companies or with other providers of services to the Property shall remain the property of Seller and be
