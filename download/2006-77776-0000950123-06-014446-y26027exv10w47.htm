in, or made pursuant to, a Competitive Bid Request. A Competitive Bid Request that does not
conform substantially to the format of Exhibit&nbsp;D-1 may be rejected in the Administrative Agent&#146;s
sole discretion, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower or such Subsidiary
Borrower of such rejection by telecopier. Such request for Competitive Bids shall in each case

Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the format of Exhibit&nbsp;D-3 may be rejected by
the Administrative Agent after conferring with, and upon the instruction of, the Borrower or the
applicable Subsidiary Borrower, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the Lender making such
nonconforming Competitive Bid of such rejection as soon as practicable. Each Competitive Bid shall
refer to this Agreement and specify (i)&nbsp;the principal Dollar Equivalent Amount (which shall be in a
minimum principal Dollar Equivalent Amount of $10,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $5,000,000

applicable Lender is willing to make to the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary Borrower, (ii)&nbsp;the Competitive Bid Rate or Rates at
which such Lender is prepared to make such Competitive Loan or Loans and (iii)&nbsp;the Interest Period
or Interest Periods with respect thereto. If any Lender shall elect not to make a Competitive Bid,
such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent via telecopier (i)&nbsp;in the case of LIBOR

all liabilities with respect thereto, from payments hereunder, if and to the extent that the
Borrower, any applicable Subsidiary Borrower or the Administrative Agent in good faith determines
that such deduction or withholding is required by Applicable Law, including, without limitation,
any applicable treaty. In the event the Borrower, any applicable Subsidiary Borrower or the
Administrative Agent shall so determine that deduction or withholding of taxes is required, it
shall advise the affected Lender as to the basis of
such determination prior to actually deducting and withholding such taxes. In the event the
Borrower, any applicable Subsidiary Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall so deduct or
withhold taxes from amounts payable hereunder, it (i)&nbsp;shall pay to or deposit with the appropriate
taxing authority in a timely manner the full amount of taxes it has deducted or withheld; (ii)
shall provide evidence of payment of such taxes to, or the deposit thereof with, the appropriate
taxing authority and a statement setting forth the amount of taxes deducted or withheld, the
applicable rate, and any other information or documentation reasonably requested by the Lenders
from whom the taxes were deducted or withheld; and (iii)&nbsp;shall forward to such Lenders any receipt
for such payment or deposit of the deducted or withheld taxes as may be issued from time to time by
the appropriate taxing authority. Unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent have received
forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating that payments hereunder are not subject to
(A)&nbsp;United States withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an applicable tax
treaty, in the case of extensions of credit made under the Revolving Commitments or (B)&nbsp;Canadian
withholding tax, in the case of extensions of credit made under the Canadian Revolving Commitment,
the Borrower, any applicable Subsidiary Borrower or the Administrative Agent may withhold taxes

Closing Date and prior to the earlier of the Termination Date and the termination of the Revolving
Commitments, upon the request of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Borrower (other than the Canadian
Subsidiary Borrower), <U>provided</U> that (A)&nbsp;the Borrower or applicable Subsidiary Borrower
shall not request that any Revolving Letter of Credit be issued if, after giving effect thereto,
the sum of the then current Revolving L/C Exposure plus the aggregate principal Dollar Equivalent
Amount of the Loans then outstanding (other than Canadian Revolving Loans) would exceed the Total

Letter of Credit having an expiration date later than five Business Days before the Termination
Date or (y)&nbsp;any Revolving Letter of Credit having an expiration date more than one year after its
date of issuance, <U>provided</U>, <U>further</U>, that any Revolving Letter of Credit with a
365-day duration may provide for the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall
in no event extend beyond the date referred to in clause (x)&nbsp;above), (C)&nbsp;neither the Borrower, nor
any Subsidiary Borrower shall request that a Revolving Issuing Lender issue any Revolving Letter of
Credit if, after giving effect to such issuance, the Revolving L/C Exposure would exceed
$200,000,000, and (D)&nbsp;a Revolving Issuing Lender shall be prohibited from issuing or renewing
Revolving Letters of Credit hereunder upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default
or an Event of Default.

not be required to) pay all or any part of the maximum amount which may at any time
be available for drawing thereunder to the beneficiary thereof upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default and the acceleration of the maturity of the Revolving Credit

Revolving Issuing Lender to secure payment to such beneficiary and any funds so
deposited shall be paid to such beneficiary of such Revolving Letter of Credit if
conditions to such payment are satisfied or returned to the Administrative Agent for
distribution to the Revolving Lenders (or, if all Obligations shall have been paid
in full in cash, to the Borrower or the applicable Subsidiary Borrower) if no
payment to such beneficiary has been made and the final date available for drawings
under such Revolving Letter of Credit has passed. Each payment or deposit of funds
by a Revolving Issuing Lender as provided in this paragraph shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as a drawing duly honored by such Revolving Issuing
Lender under the related Revolving Letter of Credit.

Revolving Issuing Lender a written notice no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) at least
five Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
