<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;For &#147;<B>Undeveloped Land</B>&#148; owned by the Borrower (<B>Sub-Limit Classification A</B>), eligibility
will be limited by the following:




<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">(i)&nbsp;Undeveloped Land identified for use as golf course, amenities,
parks, retention, preserve or other non-development uses for sale
or rental use, or any other property designated as non-master
planned community or property to be deeded to a master property
owners association, an improvement district or a CDD other third
party, is not eligible for the Borrowing Base once it has been
identified and/or Borrower is contractually obligated to convey
the property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Any CDD Bond (net of adjustments) will be deducted from the applicable Margined Value (as
hereinafter defined).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;The formation of a CDD or modifications of the conditions of or new funding by an existing
CDD on any part of the Property will require the reasonable consent of the Lender. The Lender
reserves the rights to secure an appraisal update and/or modify the Advance Rate(s) set forth in
Section&nbsp;1 above with respect to the Property under the Borrowing Base on any portion of the
Property submitted to a CDD. The Borrower shall use best efforts to obtain from the CDD quarterly
internally prepared financial reports and annual audited financial statements; and to cause the
internally prepared reports to be certified. The Borrower shall provide such reports to Lender
within thirty (30)&nbsp;days of receipt by Borrower. Lender acknowledges that any Property under the
Borrowing Base submitted to a CDD will be subject to assessments imposed by the CDD.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing Borrower Base Matrix, if any Land is optioned, contracted or
owned for a period in excess of two (2)&nbsp;years prior to the Closing Date of the Loan, the Maximum
Advance Availability will be based on the LTV Advance Rates and not the LTC Advance Rates listed in
the Borrowing Base Matrix.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;The Lender shall be responsible for administering the Borrowing Base. The following
reports shall be submitted by Borrower on monthly basis on forms and with such supporting
documentation as the Lender shall reasonably require: (i)&nbsp;a Borrowing Base Report (the Initial
Borrowing Base Report shall be used for the determination of the Maximum Advance Availability under
the Borrowing Base for the first quarter); (ii)&nbsp;an Inventory Report; (iii)&nbsp;Work in Progress Report;
and (iv)&nbsp;any other information required by Lender in Lender&#146;s reasonable discretion.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Additions, reclassifications, and all partial releases of Property under the Borrowing
Base will be processed by the Lender, with assistance from counsel, as requested by the Lender, at

acceptable to the Lender in accordance with the requirements set forth in this Loan Agreement, in
Lender&#146;s reasonable discretion, and documented in the same manner as required with respect to the

review, cost/design review, development rights review and/or progress inspections of any Land Under
Development. Borrower will provide copies of progress/development status reports from project
engineers, plans and specification, permits, development orders, and other information the Lender
may reasonably require to validate collateral eligibility under the Borrowing Base. Borrower shall
reimburse the Lender for the cost of the Lender&#146;s Inspector.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U><B>Release Prices</B></U>. Partial releases will be executed by the Lender without the
requirement for payment of a &#147;<B>Release Price</B>&#148; so long as: (a)&nbsp;there is no uncured Default; (b)&nbsp;the
Lot, development parcel, or other Property to be released is not needed in the Borrowing Base to
support outstanding borrowings, any Letters of Credit issued, or any other exposure; and (c)&nbsp;the
partial release does not negatively impact in any way the value or use of the remaining collateral.
Without limiting the foregoing, Lender acknowledges that Borrower may request, from time to time,
releases for parks, roads, and other non-developable portions of the Property including, but not
limited to, conveyances to property owners associations, CDDs and Governmental Authorities without
payment of a Release Price so long as the requirements for nonpayment of a Release Price contained
in this provision are satisfied. If release of a Lot or development parcel would result in the
amounts outstanding under the Loans being in excess of the Margined Value, the partial release may
be denied or (i)&nbsp;a reduction of principal outstanding to the Margined Value or (ii)&nbsp;an increase in
the Collateral to the Margined Value may be required by the Lender as a condition to the partial
release. Partial Releases will reduce availability in the Borrowing Base by the Margined Value of
the property released. The Borrower shall be required to provide Lender with Partial and Final Lien
Waivers (as applicable) from any party filing a Notice to Owner on any Land encumbered by Lender.

connection with the development of the Land. Lender agrees to execute all such documents, after
Lender&#146;s review and approval of same, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
without payment of any Release Price or other consideration. Without limiting the foregoing,
Lender agrees to join in all plats and subordinate the lien of the mortgage to any dedications
provided on such plats and to execute such documents as may be reasonably required from Borrower
with respect to any of the following: (i)&nbsp;recordation of any declaration of covenants and
restrictions for all or any portion of the Property; (ii)&nbsp;formation of any CDD for all or any
portion of the Property; (iii)&nbsp;any easement, license or other grant or conveyance to any

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<U><B>Revolving Loan</B></U>. The purpose of the Revolving Loan is to provide financing under
the Borrowing Base as provided in Article&nbsp;V above.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;All Requisitions for proceeds of the Loan under Sub-Limit Classifications shall be
disbursed to Borrower upon request in accordance with this Loan Agreement, subject only to the
following limitations: (i)&nbsp;Borrower is in compliance with the terms and conditions of this Loan
Agreement and the Loan Documents including, but not limited to, the Financial and Operating
Statements contained in this Loan Agreement; (ii)&nbsp;there is availability under the Borrowing Base
considering any limitations set forth in Article&nbsp;V hereof; and (iii)&nbsp;no Default shall have occurred
and be uncured as of the date of the funding request.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event funding on the Borrowing Base exceeds the
amount permitted by an inspection audit as performed by Lender&#146;s Inspector, Borrower must, within
twenty (20)&nbsp;business days after notification by Lender, either (i)&nbsp;reduce the loan balance to the
amount documented by the audit, or (ii)&nbsp;provide additional collateral acceptable to the Lender in
accordance with this Loan Agreement at a value (based on Advance Rates as noted in the Borrowing
Base Matrix) that would support the current Borrowing Base funding.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<U><B>Solvency</B></U>. At such time as Borrower shall desire to obtain a disbursement of any
portion of the Loan proceeds, Lender may require, in its reasonable discretion, that Lender be
provided with satisfactory evidence that there is not pending against Borrower a petition in
bankruptcy, whether voluntary or otherwise, any assignment for the benefit of creditors, any
petition seeking reorganization or arrangements under the Federal bankruptcy laws of the United
States or of any other action brought under the aforesaid bankruptcy laws. Such evidence shall be
in the form of affidavits signed by an officer of Borrower.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;<U><B>Access to Streets</B></U>. Lender shall not make any disbursement for construction of the
Improvements for any Land Under Development if the Land Under Development shall not have legal and
insurable access which may include an easement providing such access. Lender acknowledges and
agrees that legal access to any Land Under Development will be constructed contemporaneously with
the Improvements.

constitute a waiver of any of the conditions of Lender&#146;s obligation to make further advances, nor
in the event Borrower is unable to satisfy any such condition, shall any such waiver have the
effect of precluding Lender from thereafter declaring such inability to be an Event of Default
described herein or in the Mortgage.

governmental authorities in order to serve as performance bonds for Borrower&#146;s development of real
property. Prior to issuance of a Letter of Credit by the Lender and at such time as a Letter of
Credit is requested by Borrower for the benefit of any real property being developed with proceeds
of the Loan:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Borrower shall execute an Application and Agreement for Irrevocable Standby Letter(s) of

applicable Mortgage and guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor;



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Borrower shall pay to Bank upon issuance of the Letter of Credit a fee of <FONT style="font-size: 70%"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT>/<FONT style="font-size: 60%">2</FONT> of 1% of the
face amount of such Letter of Credit (and thereafter upon any annual renewal);



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;The Letter of Credit shall contain a thirty (30)&nbsp;day cancellation by Bank provision and
shall have an expiration date no later than twelve (12)&nbsp;months (with annual renewal options upon
payment of a renewal fee);



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;Any sums paid by Bank under the Letter of Credit shall initially accrue interest at the
Loan interest rate provided in the Note and such sum, together with accrued interest to the extent
it exceeds the Borrowing Base, shall be repaid by Borrower within five (5)&nbsp;business days from
receipt of notice from Bank that the Letter of Credit (or portions thereof) have been paid;

which said attestation forms shall be executed by an authorized officer of the Borrower and
Guarantor, respectively.

pursuant to which Borrower would receive the amount necessary to pay the interest expense due under
the Loan (exclusive of default interest or other adjustments provided for in the Loan Documents)
and would pay the amount that would be equal to the interest that would accrue on the Loan at a
fixed rate. Lender will provide this Swap to Borrower upon mutually agreeable terms. The actual
rate of the Swap would be subject to market conditions at the time the Swap is consummated. The
Swap would be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement and secured by the Collateral described in the
Loan Documents.. In the event that the Borrower exercises the Swap with Lender and in the event of
prepayment in whole or in part of the Loan, the Swap must be unwound and a &#147;breakage fee&#148; may be
due and payable to Lender.

customer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;<U><B>Integration and Relation to Loan Commitment</B></U>. The Loan Documents (a)&nbsp;integrate all
the terms and conditions mentioned in or incidental to this Loan Agreement, (b)&nbsp;supersede all oral
negotiations and prior writings with respect to their subject matter, including any loan commitment
to Borrower by Lender, and (c)&nbsp;are intended by the parties as the final expression of the agreement
with respect to the terms and conditions set forth in those documents and as the complete and
exclusive statement of the terms agreed to by the parties. No representation, understanding,
promise or condition shall be enforceable against any party unless it is contained in the Loan
Documents. If there is any conflict between the terms, conditions and provisions of this Loan
Agreement and those of any other agreement or instrument, including any other Loan Document, the
terms, conditions and provisions of this Loan Agreement shall prevail, but only to the extent of
such conflict.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;<U><B>Reasonable Standard</B></U>. Whenever Lender is required under this Loan Agreement or any
of the Loan Documents to be reasonable or to not unreasonably withhold its approval or consent,
such reasonable standard shall be deemed to have been satisfied in the event Lender acts in its
good faith judgment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>SECURITY. </B>Borrower has granted Bank a security interest in the collateral described in the
Loan Documents, including, but not limited to: (i)&nbsp;real property collateral described in that
certain Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement of even date herewith from
Borrower to Bank (the &#147;Mortgage&#148;); and (ii)&nbsp;personal property collateral described in the Mortgage.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>INTEREST RATE. </B>Interest shall accrue on the unpaid principal balance of this Note during each
Interest Period (as defined below) from the date hereof at a floating rate per annum equal to
either of the following (the &#147;Interest Rate Options&#148;):


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(i)&nbsp;the LIBOR Market Index Rate plus 2.50%, as that rate may change from day to day. &#147;LIBOR
Market Index Rate&#148;, for any day, is the rate for 1&nbsp;month U.S. dollar deposits as reported on
Telerate page 3750 as of 11:00&nbsp;a.m., London time, on such day, or if such day is not a London
business day, then the immediately preceding London business day (or if not so reported, then as
determined by Bank from another recognized source or interbank quotation), or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(ii)&nbsp;Bank&#146;s Prime Rate (as defined below) minus .25%. &#147;Bank&#146;s Prime Rate&#148; means that rate
announced by Bank from time to time a its prime rate and is one of several interest rate bases used
by Bank. Bank lends at rates both above and below Bank&#146;s Prime Rate, and Borrower acknowledges
that Bank&#146;s Prime Rate is not represented or intended to be the lowest or most favorable rate of
interest offered by Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(iii) &#147;Interest Period&#148; means each period commencing on and including the date an interest
payment is due as provided in the Repayment Terms paragraph and ending on but excluding the date
the next interest payment is due, with the first Interest Period commencing on <B>May&nbsp;3, 2005</B>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(iv)&nbsp;Borrower may change the Interest Rate Option not more than once every thirty (30)&nbsp;days by
providing written notice thereof to Bank at least three (3)&nbsp;days&#146; prior to the beginning of the
next Interest Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>DEFAULT RATE. </B>In addition to all other rights contained in this Note, if a Default (as
defined herein) occurs and as long as a Default continues, all outstanding Obligations
shall bear interest at the Interest Rate plus 3% (&#147;Default Rate&#148;). The Default Rate shall
also apply from acceleration until the Obligations or any judgment thereon is paid in full.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>INTEREST AND FEE(S) COMPUTATION (ACTUAL/360). </B>Interest and fees, if any, shall be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days in the applicable period (&#147;Actual/360
Computation&#148;). The Actual/360 Computation determines the annual effective interest yield by taking
the stated (nominal)&nbsp;rate for a year&#146;s period and then dividing said rate by 360 to determine the
daily periodic rate to be applied for each day in the applicable period. Application of the
Actual/360 Computation produces an annualized effective rate exceeding the nominal rate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REPAYMENT TERMS. </B>This Note shall be due and payable as follows: from the date of this Note
through and including the twenty-fourth month thereafter (&#147;Maturity Date&#148;), as same may be extended
pursuant to the terms of this Note, commencing on <B>May&nbsp;3, 2005</B>, and continuing on the third day of
each month thereafter, the Note shall be payable in consecutive monthly payments of accrued
interest only calculated on the outstanding principal balance. The Borrower shall have the option
to extend the term of the Loan for one additional twelve (12)&nbsp;month period (&#147;Extension Term&#148;) on
the same terms and conditions as the prior twenty-four (24)&nbsp;months of the Loan upon satisfaction of
the &#147;Conditions to Extension&#148;. Any and all remaining principal and accrued interest shall be due
and payable on the Maturity Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CONDITIONS TO EXTENSION. </B>No Event of Default under the Loan Documents shall have occurred and
be continuing and Bank has received (a)&nbsp;all the items required to be delivered pursuant to the Loan
Agreement; (b)&nbsp;approvals from all governmental authorities that are required for the Improvements
to be used as intended, (c)&nbsp;payment from Borrower of an extension fee in an amount equal to .25% of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Extension Term shall be subject to satisfaction of the Financial Covenants as outlined in the Loan Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. </B>Monies received by Bank from any source for application toward
payment of the Obligations shall be applied to pay late charges, accrued and unpaid interest,
principal, escrow (if any) and any other fees, costs and expenses which Borrower is obligated to
pay under this Note, in such order as Bank may elect from time to time in its sole discretion.
Upon the occurrence of a Default in the payment of the Obligations or a Default (as defined in the
other Loan Documents) under any other Loan Document, monies may be applied to the Obligations in
any manner or order deemed appropriate by Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">If any payment received by Bank under this Note or other Loan Documents is rescinded, avoided
or for any reason returned by Bank because of any adverse claim or threatened action, the returned
payment shall remain payable as an obligation of all persons liable under this Note or other Loan
Documents as though such payment had not been made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>OPTIONAL HEDGE. </B>During the term of the Loan, Borrower will be provided
with an option to hedge the Loan&#146;s floating interest expense by entering into a future
interest rate swap (the &#147;Swap&#148;) with Bank contemporaneously with the closing of the loan, pursuant
to which Borrower would receive the amount necessary to pay the interest expense due under the Loan
(exclusive of default interest or other adjustments provided for in the loan documents) and would
pay the amount that would be equal to the interest that would accrue on the Loan at a fixed rate.
Bank is willing to provide this Swap to Borrower upon mutually agreeable terms. The actual rate of
the Swap would be subject to market conditions at the time the Swap is consummated. The Swap would
be governed by an ISDA Master Agreement and secured by the Collateral described herein. In the
event that the Borrower exercises the Swap with Bank and in the event of prepayment in whole or in
part of the Loan, the Swap must be unwound and a &#147;breakage fee&#148; may be due and payable to Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>PREPAYMENT. </B>This Note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time,
without penalty, provided, however, that Borrower shall indemnify Bank against Bank&#146;s additional
cost to break a LIBOR Agreement which is prepaid, if any (&#147;Indemnified Loss or Expense&#148;). The
amount of such indemnified Loss or Expense shall be determined by Bank based upon the assumption
that Bank funded one hundred percent (100%) of the Note in the London Interbank Market. Any
prepayment shall include accrued and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment on the principal
amount prepaid and all other sums due and payable hereunder. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
alter or affect any obligations that Borrower may have to Bank under any Swap (as defined herein).
Should Borrower exercise the Swap with Bank, then in the event of prepayment in whole or in part of
this Note, the Swap must be unwound. In the event that the Swap is unwound, a &#147;breakage fee&#148; may
be due and payable to Bank. For purposes hereof the term &#147;Swap&#148; means an agreement between
Borrower and Bank (or other counterparty acceptable to Bank) pursuant to which Borrower shall
receive an amount necessary to pay the interest expenses due under this Note (exclusive of default
interest or other adjustments provided for in the Loan Documents) and shall pay the amount that
would be equal to the interest that would accrue on this Note at a fixed rate.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>DEFINITIONS. Loan Documents. </B>The term &#147;Loan Documents&#148;, as used in this Note and the other
Loan Documents, refers to all documents executed in connection with or related to the loan
evidenced by this Note and any prior notes which evidence all or any portion of the loan evidenced
by this Note, and any letters of credit issued pursuant to any loan agreement to which this Note is

the Uniform Commercial Code of the jurisdiction where this Mortgage is recorded (the &#147;UCC&#148;),
whether cash or non-cash, and including insurance proceeds and condemnation awards; and all
replacements, substitutions and accessions thereof.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that Mortgagor is the owner of a leasehold estate with respect to any portion of
the Property and Mortgagor obtains a fee estate in such portions of the Property, then, such fee
estate shall automatically, and without further action of any kind on the part of the Mortgagor, be

of FORTY MILLION AND 00/100 DOLLARS ($40,000,000.00) (&#147;Original Maximum Principal Amount&#148;), plus
all interest, costs, reimbursements, fees and expenses in connection therewith.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mortgagor WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS that Mortgagor is lawfully seized of the Property, in fee
simple, absolute, that Mortgagor has the legal right to convey and encumber the same, and that the
Property is free and clear of all liens and encumbrances other than as set forth in the title
policy provided to and approved by Bank and other matters as set forth in the Permitted Exceptions
and contemplated by the Loan Documents and approved by Lender (&#147;Permitted Exceptions&#148;). Mortgagor
further warrants and will forever defend all and singular the Property and title thereto to Bank
and Bank&#146;s successors and assigns, against the lawful claims of all persons whomsoever subject to
the Permitted Exceptions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PROVIDED ALWAYS that if (i)&nbsp;all the Obligations (including without limitation, all termination
payments and any other amounts due under or in connection with any swap agreements (as defined in
11 U.S.C. &#167; 101) secured hereunder) are paid in full, (ii)&nbsp;each and every representation, warranty,

and abided by, and (iii)&nbsp;any and all swap agreements (as defined in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101) secured
hereunder have matured or been terminated, then this Mortgage and the estate hereby created shall
cease and be null, void, and canceled of record.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To protect the security of this Mortgage, Mortgagor further represents and agrees with Bank as

other evidences of obligation now or hereafter secured by this Mortgage shall be in the form of a
continual revolving line of credit whereby advances may be made, repaid and re-advanced from time
to time but in no event shall the outstanding principal balance at any time exceed the Original
Maximum Principal Amount. Bank shall maintain an account on its books, which shall evidence at all
times the amount from time to time outstanding under the Note or any other promissory note now or
hereafter made evidencing the indebtedness secured hereby. Advances made by Bank pursuant to the

the collection of any or all of such sums of money and interest thereon in whatever manner the
indebtedness may be evidenced or represented, shall be secured by this Mortgage until the Mortgage
is satisfied of record.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Future Advances. </B>This Mortgage is given to secure not only existing Obligations, but also
future advances, including obligations under swap agreements made, and future swap agreements (as
defined in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 101) entered into with Bank, within twenty (20)&nbsp;years of the date of this
Mortgage pursuant to a Revolving Loan Agreement between Borrower and Bank of even date herewith
(the &#147;Loan Agreement&#148;) to the same extent as if such future advances and obligations under swap
agreements are made on the date of the execution of this Mortgage. The principal amount (including
any swap agreements and future advances) that may be so secured may decrease or increase from time
to time, but the total amount so secured at any one time shall not exceed TWENTY MILLION AND 00/100
Dollars ($20,000.00.00), plus all interest, costs, reimbursements, fees and expenses due under this
Mortgage and secured hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum principal amount secured
hereby shall not exceed the Original Maximum Principal Amount. All covenants and agreements
contained in this Mortgage shall be applicable to all further advances made by Bank to Mortgagor
under this future advance clause. Any such future advances, whether obligatory or to be
made at the option of Bank, or otherwise, may be made either prior to or after the due date of the
Note or any other note secured by this Mortgage. Mortgagor shall not execute any document that
impairs or otherwise impacts the priority of any existing or future Obligations secured by this
Mortgage.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Grant of Security Interest in Personal Property. </B>This Mortgage constitutes a security
agreement under the UCC and shall be deemed to constitute a fixture financing statement. Mortgagor
hereby grants a security interest in any personal property included in the Property. On request of
Bank, Mortgagor will execute one or more Financing Statements in form satisfactory to Bank and will
pay all costs and expenses of filing the same in all public filing offices, where filing is deemed
desirable by Bank. Bank is authorized to file Financing Statements relating to the Property
without Mortgagor&#146;s signature where permitted by law. Mortgagor appoints Bank as its
attorney-in-fact to execute such documents necessary to perfect Bank&#146;s security interest on
Mortgagor&#146;s behalf. The appointment is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable as long
as any Obligations remain outstanding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Nothing herein obligates Bank to provide credit in excess of the Obligations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Leases, Subleases and Easements. </B>Mortgagor shall maintain, enforce and cause to be performed
all of the terms and conditions under any lease, sublease or easement which may constitute a
portion of the Property. Mortgagor shall not, without the consent of Bank, enter into any new
lease of all or any portion of the Property outside the criteria for said leases approved by Bank,
agree to the cancellation or surrender under any lease of all or any portion of the Property, agree
to prepayment of rents, issues or profits (other than rent paid at the signing of a lease or
sublease), modify any such lease so as to shorten the term, decrease the rent, accelerate the
payment of rent, or change the terms of any renewal option; and any such purported new lease,
cancellation, surrender, prepayment or modification made without the consent of Bank shall be void
as against Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Required Insurance. </B>Mortgagor shall maintain with respect to the Property liability insurance
providing coverage in such amount as Bank may require but in no event less than $1,000,000.00 per
occurrence, with aggregate excess coverage of not less than

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">$10,000,000.00<I>, </I>naming Bank as an
additional insured, and such other insurance as Bank may require from time to time.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All property insurance policies shall contain an endorsement or agreement by the insurer in
form satisfactory to Bank that any loss shall be payable in accordance with the terms of such
policy notwithstanding any act or negligence of Mortgagor and the further agreement (within both
the property and liability policies) of the insurer waiving rights of subrogation against Bank, and
rights of set-off, counterclaim or deductions against Mortgagor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All insurance policies shall be in form, provide coverages, be issued by companies and be in
amounts satisfactory to Bank. At least 30&nbsp;days prior to the expiration of each such policy,
Mortgagor shall furnish Bank with evidence satisfactory to Bank that such policy has been renewed
or replaced or is no longer required hereunder. All such policies shall provide that the policy
will not be canceled or materially amended without at least 30&nbsp;days prior written notice to Bank.
In the event Mortgagor fails to provide, maintain, keep in force, and furnish to Bank the policies
of insurance required by this paragraph, Bank may procure such insurance or single-interest
insurance in such amounts, at such premium, for such risks and by such means as Bank chooses, at
Mortgagor&#146;s expense; provided however, Bank shall have no responsibility to obtain any insurance,
but if Bank does obtain insurance, Bank shall have no responsibility to assure that the insurance
obtained shall be adequate or provide any protection to Mortgagor.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Insurance Proceeds. </B>After occurrence of any loss to any of the Property, Mortgagor shall give
prompt written notice thereof to Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Impositions; Escrow Deposit. </B>Mortgagor will pay all taxes, levies, assessments and other fees
and charges imposed upon or which may become a lien upon the Property under any law or ordinance
(all of the foregoing collectively &#147;Impositions&#148;) before they become delinquent and in any event in
the same calendar year in which they first become due. Upon request of Bank after an Event of
Default, Mortgagor shall add to each periodic payment required under the Note the amount estimated
by Bank to be sufficient to enable Bank to pay, as they come due, all Impositions and insurance
premiums which Mortgagor is required to pay hereunder. Payments requested under this provision
shall be supplemented or adjusted as required by Bank from time to time. Such funds may be
commingled with the general funds of Bank and shall not earn interest. Upon the occurrence of a
Default, Bank may apply such funds to pay any of the Obligations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Use of Property. </B>Mortgagor shall use and operate, and require its lessees or licensees to use
and operate, the Property in compliance with all applicable laws (including, for example, the
Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act) and ordinances, covenants, and
restrictions, and with all applicable requirements of any lease or sublease now or hereafter
affecting the Property. Mortgagor shall not permit any unlawful use of the Property or any use
that may give rise to a claim of forfeiture of any of the Property. Mortgagor shall not allow
changes in the stated use of Property from that disclosed to Bank at the time of execution hereof
or approved by Bank, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Mortgagor shall not
initiate or acquiesce to a zoning change of the Property without prior notice to, and written
consent of, Bank.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Maintenance, Repairs and Alterations. </B>Mortgagor shall keep and maintain the Property in good
condition and repair and fully protected from the elements to the satisfaction of Bank. Mortgagor
shall promptly notify Bank in writing of any material loss, damage or adverse condition affecting
the Property.

any public use or improvement or condemnation proceeding (&#147;Condemnation&#148;), or should Mortgagor
receive any notice or other information regarding such Condemnation, Mortgagor shall give prompt
written notice thereof to Bank. In the event the Collateral for the Borrowing Base is negatively
impacted resulting in an adjusted loss in the value of the Collateral, Bank shall be entitled to
all compensation, awards and other payments or relief granted in connection with such Condemnation
and, at its option, may commence, appear in and prosecute in its own name any action or proceedings
relating thereto. Mortgagor shall be entitled to make any compromise or settlement in connection
with such taking or damage after consulting with and obtaining Bank&#146;s prior written consent. All
compensation, awards, and damages awarded to Mortgagor related to any Condemnation (the &#147;Proceeds&#148;)
in accordance herewith are hereby assigned to Bank and Mortgagor agrees to execute such further assignments of
the Proceeds as Bank may require. Bank shall have the option of applying or paying the Proceeds in
the same manner as insurance proceeds as provided herein. Mortgagor appoints Bank as its

failure to meet the requirements of any Environmental Laws; or (iii)&nbsp;Hazardous Materials which,
while the Property is subject to this Mortgage, exist on the Property but not for matters occurring
after foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof. Bank shall have the right to arrange for or conduct
environmental inspections of the Property from time to time (including the taking of soil, water,
air or material samples). The cost of such inspections (i)&nbsp;made after Default, (ii)&nbsp;which are
required by laws or regulations applicable to Bank, or (iii)&nbsp;which are ordered by Bank following
Bank&#146;s good faith determination that Mortgagor may be in violation of any Environmental Laws and/or
there are Hazardous Materials on the Property, shall be borne by Mortgagor. However, Mortgagor&#146;s
indemnity shall not apply to any negligent or intentional act of Bank, its successors or assigns,
which takes place after foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or satisfaction of this Mortgage.
These indemnification obligations are in addition to General Indemnification provisions set forth
hereafter. Mortgagor&#146;s Obligations under this section shall continue, survive and remain in full
force and effect notwithstanding the repayment of the Obligations, a foreclosure of or exercise of
power of sale under this instrument, a delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, a cancellation or
termination of record of this instrument and the transfer of the Property.

by the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
any other regulatory agency or at such other times as Bank may reasonably require. Such appraisals
shall be performed by an independent third party appraiser selected by Bank. The cost of such
appraisals shall be borne by Mortgagor. If requested by Bank, Mortgagor shall execute an
engagement letter addressed to the appraiser selected by Bank. Mortgagor&#146;s failure or refusal to
sign such an engagement letter, however, shall not impair Bank&#146;s right to obtain such an appraisal.
Mortgagor agrees to pay the cost of such appraisal within 10&nbsp;days after receiving an invoice for
such appraisal.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Inspections. </B>Bank, or its representatives or agents, are authorized to enter at any
reasonable time upon any part of the Property for the purpose of inspecting the Property and for
the purpose of performing any of the acts it is authorized to perform under the terms of this
Mortgage.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Liens and Subrogation. </B>Mortgagor shall pay and promptly discharge all liens, claims and
encumbrances upon the Property except for those described in EXHIBIT B or those matters
contemplated by the Loan Documents and approved by Bank. Mortgagor shall have the right to contest
in good faith the validity of any such lien, claim or encumbrance, provided: (i)&nbsp;such contest
suspends the collection thereof or there is no danger of the Property being sold or forfeited while
such contest is pending; (ii)&nbsp;Mortgagor first deposits with Bank a bond or other security
satisfactory to Bank in such amounts as Bank shall reasonably require; and (iii)&nbsp;Mortgagor
thereafter diligently proceeds to cause such lien, claim or encumbrance to be removed and
discharged.

benefit of all laws now existing or that hereafter may be enacted providing for (i)&nbsp;any
appraisement before sale of any portion of the Property, (ii)&nbsp;in any way extending the time for the

interest at the default rate stated in the Note and shall be secured by this Mortgage.
