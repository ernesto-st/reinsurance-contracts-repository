                                                  DEFINITIONS</b>

References to amounts on particular exhibits, schedules, lines, pages and columns on such Annual Statements are
based on the formats promulgated by the NAIC for 2001 Annual Statements for the applicable type of insurance
company. If such format is changed in future years so that different information is contained in such items or
they no longer exist, it is understood that the reference is to information consistent with that recorded in
the referenced item in the 2000 Annual Statement of the applicable insurance company.

      <i>"Applicable Margin"</i> means, at any time, the rate per annum determined in accordance with the following:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     LEVEL       PARENT S&amp;P RATING    PARENT MOODY'S RATING   APPLICABLE MARGIN
-------------- --------------------- ----------------------- -------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      <i>Provided, however,</i> that the forgoing shall be subject to the following:

            (a) The terms "Parent S&amp;P Rating" and "Parent Moody's Rating" shall for all purposes of this
      Agreement mean the ratings solicited by the Parent from and issued by S&amp;P or Moody's, respectively,
      for the long term unsecured debt of the Parent. The term "Rating" shall refer to any of the forgoing
      ratings.

            (b) If only an S&amp;P Rating or a Moody's Rating is available then the Applicable Margins shall be
      determined on the basis of the Rating which is available but if both such Ratings are available and the
      Ratings are split (<i>i.e.</i>, the Ratings are not at the same level as contemplated by the foregoing grid)
      then (i) the Applicable Margins shall be determined based upon whichever of the two Ratings yields the
      highest Applicable Margin if the two ratings differ by only one level and (ii) the Applicable Margin
      shall be determined based on the level which is one level above the level of the lower of the two ratings
      if the two ratings differ by more than one level. If neither an S&amp;P Rating nor a Moody's Rating is
      available then in that event the Applicable Margin shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, after
      consultation with the Parent, so as to approximate the Administrative Agent's estimate of what the
      ratings of long term unsecured indebtedness of the Parent would have been had such ratings been available,
      the determination of the Administrative Agent to be final and conclusive <i>provided</i> it was  active in
      good faith.

                                                      -2-
<PAGE>

            (c) Changes in the Applicable Margin resulting from Rating changes or from Ratings becoming, or
      ceasing to be, available shall become effective upon the date of the occurrence in question.

            (d) References to rating categories hereinabove are references to such categories as presently
      determined by S&amp;P and Moody's and in the event a ratings system referred to hereinabove is changed by any
      such rating agency, each reference to a particular rating set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to
      be a reference to the rating under such changed rating system which, in the reasonable judgment of the
      Administrative Agent, after consultation with the rating service involved, most closely approximates the
      level of financial condition associated with the particular rating as currently defined.

            (e) The Applicable Margin shall initially be 1.375% per annum and shall not be subject to downward
      adjustment prior to March 23, 2003.

      <i>"Arrangers"</i> means Fleet Securities, Inc. and Bank of Montreal in their capacities as such.

      <i>"Assignee"</i> has the meaning specified in subsection 13.8(a).

      <i>"Assignment and Acceptance"</i> has the meaning specified in Section 13.8(a).

      <i>"Attorney Costs"</i> means and includes all fees and disbursements of any law firm or other external
counsel, the non-duplicative allocated cost of internal legal services and all disbursements of internal
counsel.

      <i>"Banks"</i> means the financial institutions from time to time parties hereto other than the Borrowers.

      <i>"Bankruptcy Code"</i> means the Federal Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 (11 U.S.C. ss.101, et seq.), as
amended from time to time.

      <i>"Base Rate"</i> means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the higher of: (a) 0.50% per annum above the
Federal Funds Rate in effect for such date; and (b) the rate of interest announced by BMO from time to time as
its prime commercial rate for Dollar loans made in the United States (it being understood that such rate may
not be BMO's best or lowest rate), as in effect on such day. Any change in the Base Rate resulting from a
change in such prime commercial rate shall take effect at the opening of business on the day specified in the
announcement of such change.

      <i>"Base Rate Loan"</i> means a Loan that bears interest based on the Base Rate.

      <i>"BMO"</i> means Bank of Montreal, a chartered bank of Canada.

      <i>Section 2.1. Amounts and Terms of Commitments.</i> Each Bank severally agrees, on the terms and conditions
set forth herein, to make loans to the Borrowers (each such loan, a <i>"Loan"</i>) from time to time on any Business
Day during the period from the Effective Date to the Termination Date, in an aggregate amount not to exceed at
any time outstanding, together with the principal amount of Loans outstanding in favor of such Bank at such
time, the amount set forth next to such Bank's name on Schedule 2.1 (such amount as the same may be reduced
under Section 2.5 or as a result of one or more assignments under Section 13.8, the Bank's

                                                      -15-

<i>"Commitment"); provided, however,</i> that, after giving effect to any Borrowing, the aggregate principal amount
of all outstanding Loans shall not at any time exceed the combined Commitments. Within the limits of each
Bank's Commitment, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this
Section 2.1, prepay under Section 2.6 and reborrow under this Section 2.1.

      <i>Section 2.2. Loan Accounts.</i> (a) The Loans made by each Bank to each Borrower shall be evidenced by one
or more loan accounts or records maintained by such Bank in the ordinary course of business. The loan accounts
or records maintained by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of
the Loans made by the Banks to each Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure so to record or
any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrowers hereunder
to pay any amount owing with respect to the Loans.

      (b) Upon the request of any Bank made through the Administrative Agent, the Loans made by such Bank to
each Borrower may be evidenced by one or more Notes, instead of loan accounts. Each such Bank shall endorse on
the reverse of or on schedules annexed to its Note(s) the date, amount and maturity of each Loan made by it to
the applicable Borrower and the amount of each payment of principal made by each Borrower with respect thereto.
Each such Bank is irrevocably authorized by each Borrower to endorse its Note(s); <i>provided, however,</i> that the
failure of a Bank to make, or an error in making, a notation thereon with respect to any Loan shall not limit
or otherwise affect the obligations of the Borrowers hereunder or under any such Note to such Bank.

      <i>Section 2.3. Procedure for Borrowing.</i> (a) Each Borrowing shall be made upon the applicable Borrower's
irrevocable written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent in the form of a Notice of Borrowing (which
notice must be received by the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) (i) three Business
Days prior to the requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans; and (ii) on the date of
Borrowing, in the case of Base Rate Loans, specifying:

                  (A) the amount of the Borrowing, which shall be in an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000
            or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;

                  (B) the requested Borrowing Date, which shall be a Business Day;

                  (C) the Type of Loans comprising the Borrowing; and

                  (D) in the case of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the duration of the Interest Period applicable to
            such Loans included in such notice. If the Notice of Borrowing fails to specify the duration of the
            Interest Period for any Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans, such Interest Period shall be
            three months.

      (b) After giving effect to any Borrowing, there may be no more than 5 different Interest Periods in
effect.

      (c) Each Borrowing shall be made from the Banks in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.

      <i>Section 2.4. Conversion and Continuation Elections.</i> (a) Each Borrower may, upon irrevocable written
notice to the Administrative Agent in accordance with subsection 2.4(b):

             (i) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of its Base Rate Loans, or as of the last day of
      the applicable Interest Period, in the case of its Eurodollar Rate Loans, to convert any such Loans (or
      any part thereof in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000
      in excess thereof) into Loans of any other Type; or

            (ii) elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period, to continue any Loans having
      Interest Periods expiring on such day (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or that
      is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof);

<i>provided,</i> that if at any time the aggregate amount of Eurodollar Rate Loans in respect of any Borrowing is
reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of part thereof to be less than $5,000,000, such Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans.

      (b) The applicable Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation to be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) at least (i) three Business Days in advance
of the Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted into or continued as Eurodollar Rate
Loans; and (ii) on the Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are to be converted into Base Rate Loans,
specifying:

            (A) the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date;

            (B) the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or continued;

            (C) the Type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion or continuation; and

            (D) in the case of continuations of or conversions into Eurodollar Rate Loans, the duration of the
      requested Interest Period.

      (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to Eurodollar Rate Loans, the applicable
Borrower has failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Rate Loans, or
if any Default or Event of Default then exists, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such
Eurodollar Rate Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest Period.

      (d) The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Bank of its receipt of a Notice of
Conversion/Continuation, or, if no timely notice is provided by the applicable Borrower, the Administrative
Agent will promptly notify each Bank of the details of any automatic conversion.


                                                      -17-
<PAGE>

All conversions and continuations shall be made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal
amounts of the Loans with respect to which the notice was given held by each Bank.

      (e) Unless the Majority Banks otherwise agree, with respect to all Loans during the existence of a
Default or Event of Default, the Borrowers may not elect to have a Loan converted into or continued as an
Eurodollar Rate Loan.

      (f) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of Loans, there may not be more than 5
different Interest Periods in effect.

      <i>Section 2.5. Voluntary Termination or Reduction of Commitments.</i> The Borrowers may, upon not less than
three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the Commitments, or permanently reduce
the Commitments by an aggregate minimum amount of $5,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof;
<i>provided, however,</i> that after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of Loans made on the effective date
thereof, the then- outstanding principal amount of the Loans may not exceed the amount of the combined
Commitments then in effect. Once reduced in accordance with this Section, the Commitments may not be increased.
Any reduction of the Commitments shall be applied to each Bank according to its Pro Rata Share. All accrued
facility fees to, but not including the effective date of any reduction or termination of Commitments, shall be
paid on the effective date of such reduction or termination.

      <i>Section 2.6. Optional Prepayments.</i>

      (a) <i>Voluntary Prepayments.</i> Subject to Section 3.4, any Borrower may, at any time or from time to time,
upon not less than three Business Days' (or one Business Day's, in the case of Base Rate Loans) irrevocable
notice to the Administrative Agent, ratably prepay its Loans in whole or in part, in minimum amounts of
$5,000,000 or any multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Such notice of prepayment shall specify the date
and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid. The Administrative Agent will promptly
notify each Bank of its receipt of any such notice, and of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of such prepayment. If
such notice is given by a Borrower, such Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified
in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein, together with accrued interest to each
such date on the amount prepaid and any amounts required pursuant to Section 3.4.

      (b) <i>Mandatory Prepayments.</i>

            (i) <i>Equity Issuances.</i> Promptly upon receipt thereof by the Parent or a Subsidiary, the Parent shall
pay over to the Administrative Agent as and for a mandatory prepayment on the Loans an amount equal to 100% of
all net cash proceeds (i.e., gross proceeds less out of pocket costs at issuance including underwriters
discounts, investment banking, legal and advisory fees) received by the Parent or any Subsidiary from a public
offering, private placement or other issuance or sale of the capital stock or other equity interests (or of
warrants, options or other rights therefor) of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, <i>provided however</i> that no

                                                     -18-
<PAGE>

such prepayment need be made out of the proceeds of the issuance or sale of equity interests in a Subsidiary to
the Parent or to another Subsidiary.

           (ii) <i>Debt Issuances.</i> Promptly upon receipt by the Parent or any Subsidiary of any amounts from or
out of the issuance of any Indebtedness, the Parent shall or shall cause any borrowing Subsidiary which has
Loans outstanding to, pay over to the Administrative Agent as and for a mandatory prepayment on the Loans an
amount equal to the net cash proceeds (i.e., gross proceeds less actual out of pocket costs and expenses of
issuance including investment banking, advisory and legal fees) received by the Parent or its Subsidiaries
therefrom except that no such prepayment shall be required to be made out of (i) the issuance of Indebtedness
by any Subsidiary to the Parent or any other Subsidiary, (ii) payments received under Swap Contracts, (iii)
Indebtedness consisting of capitalized leases, conditional sales or other retention devices incurred for the
purpose of financing the purchase of fixed or capital assets, (iv) the proceeds of Indebtedness incurred by
Subsidiaries engaged in the business of insurance to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred for the purpose
of satisfying a regulatory requirement or supporting the conduct by such Subsidiary of its business of
insurance, in each case under circumstances under which the proceeds of such Indebtedness are retained by such
insurance Subsidiary and not used to pay a dividend or retire Indebtedness owing the Parent or another
Subsidiary, (v) Indebtedness outstanding under this Agreement, and (vi) other Indebtedness not otherwise
excepted by the forgoing and aggregating not more than $25,000,000 at any one time outstanding.

          (iii) <i>Fixed Asset Proceeds.</i> An amount equal to any and all net cash proceeds (i.e., gross cash
proceeds net of out of pocket expenses and property and transfer taxes incurred in effecting the sale or other
disposition in question and net of proceeds applied to repayment of liens on the assets sold or disposed of)
received by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from the sale or other disposition (whether voluntary or
involuntary) of fixed or capital assets (including the proceeds of a sale as part of sale/leaseback transaction
and proceeds (including insurance proceeds) received as a result of damage to or destruction of fixed or
capital assets and the proceeds of any taking, whether by eminent domain or otherwise, of any such assets)
shall be promptly paid over to the Administrative Agent as and for a mandatory prepayment on the Loans <i>provided</i>
<i>however</i> that (aa) the forgoing provision shall be inapplicable to funds received as a result of casualty
losses or condemnations in the event that either the amount received in respect of any particular occurrence is
less than $2,500,000 or the Parent notifies the Administrative Agent that the Parent or the applicable
Subsidiary intends to utilize the proceeds in question to repair or replace the asset damaged or destroyed and
such proceeds are in fact so utilized within 180 days of their receipt by the Parent or the applicable
Subsidiary, (ab) no prepayment shall be required with respect to net cash proceeds received from the ordinary
course of business, sale or other disposition of fixed or capital assets which are obsolete or worn out; and
(ac) no prepayment shall be required out of the first $2,500,000 of such net cash proceeds received by the
Parent and its Subsidiaries in any fiscal year which are not otherwise excepted from prepayment hereunder.

      (iv) <i>Securitization Transactions.</i> An amount equal to any and all net cash proceeds (i.e., gross cash
proceeds, net of out of pocket expenses including investment banking, advisory and legal fees) received by the
Parent or its Subsidiaries from the sale of accounts receivable, notes

                                                      -19-
<PAGE>

receivable or other financial assets or which is the proceeds of obligations the payment of which is tied to
the performance of the closed block of business of PLIC shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent as and
for a mandatory prepayment on the Loans, <i>provided, however</i> that (aa) there shall be exempted from the forgoing
any amount of the proceeds of such a transaction which is required by the parties to the transaction which are
not Affiliates of the Parent to be retained to assure performance of the transaction (including retentions of
amounts in the nature of a debt service reserve fund), (ab) no prepayment need be made out of the sale or
liquidation of investments made in the ordinary course of business of the Parent and its Subsidiaries
substantially as now conducted and (ac) any transaction of the forgoing types by a Subsidiary engaged in the
business of insurance shall not require prepayment hereunder if and to the extent that the proceeds of the
transaction are required to be retained by the Subsidiary in question in order to satisfy a regulatory
requirement to which it is subject or to the extent that such retention is in the opinion of any applicable
commissioner of insurance or other regulatory body necessary or appropriate to maintain the soundness of such
insurance Subsidiary whether or not the opinion of such commissioner of insurance or regulatory body has the
force of law. If any transaction described in this clause (iv) could also be characterized as the incurrence of
Indebtedness the provisions of this clause (iv) shall control over the provisions of clause (ii) hereof.

      (v) <i>Breakage.</i> If a mandatory prepayment could not be made without prepaying Eurodollar Rate Loans and
such a prepayment would result in a reimbursement obligation arising under Section 3.4 hereof, the Parent or
other depositor may, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, elect to deposit
the amount of the prepayment with the Administrative Agent to be held by the Administrative Agent until such
prepayment can be effected without triggering a reimbursement liability under Section 3.4 hereof. The amounts
so held by the Administrative Agent, may at the option of Parent or other depositor be invested in an interest
bearing account maintained with the Administrative Agent, or other high grade investments mutually acceptable
to the depositor and the Administrative Agent pending application of the proceeds thereof to Eurodollar Rate
Loans, all such investments to constitute collateral security for the Obligations to be prepaid and with the
earnings on such investments to be remitted to the depositor.

      (vi) <i>General Principles and Applications.</i> If and to the extent that any transaction giving rise to a
requirement of prepayment under this Section 2.6(b) results in the receipt of funds by a Subsidiary which is
not a Borrower or receipt of funds by a Borrower in excess of the amount of its Loans hereunder, the Parent
shall nonetheless cause an amount equal to the amount required to be prepaid hereunder to be paid over to the
Administrative Agent as aforesaid and, without limiting the forgoing principles in any respect, nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to require any party to directly prepay Loans for which it is not the obligor or a
guarantor.

      <i>Section 2.7. Repayment.</i> Each Borrower shall repay to the Banks on the Termination Date the aggregate
principal amount of the Loans to it which are outstanding on such date.

      <i>Section 2.8. Interest.</i> (a) Each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof
from the applicable Borrowing Date at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate or the Base Rate, as the
case may be (and subject to the applicable Borrower's right to

                                                      -20-
<PAGE>

convert to other Types of Loans under Section 2.4), <i>plus</i> the Applicable Margin, in the case of Eurodollar Rate
Loans.

      (b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date. Interest shall also be
paid on the date of any prepayment of Loans under Section 2.6 for the portion of the Loans so prepaid and upon
payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and, with respect to any Loan during the existence of any Event
of Default, interest shall be paid on demand of the Administrative Agent at the request or with the consent of
the Majority Banks.

      (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section with respect to any Loan, while any Event of Default
exists or after acceleration, the applicable Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before entry of
judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all outstanding Loans, at a rate
per annum which is determined by adding 2% per annum to the Applicable Margin then in effect for such Loans
and, in the case of Base Rate Loans, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2%; <i>provided, however,</i>
that, on and after the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan outstanding on
the date of occurrence of such Event of Default or acceleration, the principal amount of such Loan shall,
during the continuation of such Event of Default or after acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate plus 2%.

      (d) <i>Highest Lawful Rate.</i> At no time shall the interest rate payable on the Loans of any Bank, together
with the fees and all other amounts payable under the Loan Documents to such Bank, to the extent the same are
construed to constitute interest, exceed the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Bank. If with respect to
any Bank for any period during the term of this Agreement, any amount paid to such Bank under the Loan
Documents, to the extent the same shall (but for the provisions of this Section) constitute or be deemed to
constitute interest, would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable to such Bank during such period (such amount being hereinafter referred to as an <i>"Unqualified Amount"</i>),
then (i) such Unqualified Amount shall be applied or shall be deemed to have been applied as a prepayment of
the Loans of such Bank, and (ii) if in any subsequent period during the term of this Agreement, all amounts
payable under the Loan Documents to such Bank in respect of such period which constitute or shall be deemed to
constitute interest shall be less than the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate
applicable to such Bank during such period, then the Borrowers shall pay to such Bank in respect of such period
an amount (each a <i>"Compensatory Interest Payment"</i>) equal to the lesser of (x) a sum which, when added to all
such amounts, would equal the maximum amount of interest permitted by the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to
such Bank during such period, and (y) an amount equal to the Unqualified Amount less all other Compensatory
Interest Payments made in respect thereof.

      <i>Section 2.9. Fees.</i> (a)<i> Arrangement, Agency Fee.</i> The Parent shall pay such fees to the Arrangers and
the Agents for their own accounts as may be agreed to between the Parent and the Arrangers and the Agents from
time to time.

      (b) <i>Facility Fee.</i> The Parent shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a
facility fee (the <i>"Facility Fee"</i>) on such Bank's Commitment, whether or not in use, computed on a
quarterly basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter as

                                                      -21-
<PAGE>

calculated by the Administrative Agent, at the rate per annum equal at all times to .25% per annum. Such
Facility Fee shall accrue from the Effective Date to the Termination Date and shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each calendar quarter (commencing on March 31, 2003) through
the Termination Date, with the final payment to be made on the Termination Date; provided that, in connection
with any reduction or termination of the Commitments, the accrued Facility Fee calculated for the period ending
on such date shall also be paid on the date of such reduction or termination, with the following quarterly
payment being calculated on the basis of the period from such reduction or termination date to such quarterly
payment date. The Facility Fees provided in this subsection shall accrue at all times after the above-mentioned
commencement date, including at any time during which one or more conditions in Section 4.2 are not met.

      (c) <i>Usage Fee.</i> The Parent shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a usage fee
at the rate of .125% per annum on the full aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Bank's Loans for each
day when such aggregate outstanding principal balance exceeds 33% of its Commitment, such fee to be computed
for each day on which such an excess exists but to be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of
each calendar quarter through the Termination Date, with the final payment to be made on the Termination Date,
<i>provided</i> that if the Commitments are terminated in whole, the accrued usage fee calculated for the period
ending on the date of such termination in whole shall be paid on that date.

      (d) <i>Upfront Fee.</i> On the date hereof the Parent shall pay to each Bank a fee in the amount which has been
agreed upon between them.

      <i>Section 2.10. Computation of Fees and Interest.</i> (a) All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans when
the Base Rate is determined by the prime commercial rate of BMO and all computations of the Facility Fees and
usage fees shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days
elapsed. All other computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days
elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest
and fees shall accrue during each Interest Period or other period during which interest or such fees are
computed from the first day thereof to but excluding the last day thereof.

      (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrowers and the Banks in the absence of manifest error.

      <i>Section 2.11. Payments.</i> (a) All payments to be made by the Borrowers or any of them shall be made
without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all such payments
shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Banks at the Administrative Agent's Payment
Office, and shall be made in dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 12:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its Pro
Rata Share (or other applicable share as expressly provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received.
Any payment received by the Administrative Agent later than 12:00 p.m. (New York City time) shall be deemed to
have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

      (b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest Period" herein, whenever any
payment is due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made the following Business Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as the case may
be.

      (c) Unless the Administrative Agent receives notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any
payment is due to the Banks that such Borrower will not make such payment in full as and when required, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on
such date in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required), in
reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due
such Bank. If and to the extent each Borrower has not made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent,
such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with
interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Bank
until the date repaid.

      <i>Section 2.12. Payments by the Banks to the Administrative Agent.</i> (a) Unless the Administrative Agent
receives notice from a Bank on or prior to the Effective Date or, with respect to any Borrowing after the
Effective Date, at least one Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Bank will not make
available as and when required hereunder to the Administrative Agent for the account of a Borrower the amount
of that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that each Bank has made
such amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds on the Borrowing Date and the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be so required) in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
applicable Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its
full amount available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds and the Administrative Agent
in such circumstances has made available to a Borrower such amount, that Bank shall on the Business Day
following such Borrowing Date make such amount available to the Administrative Agent, together with interest at
the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period. A notice of the Administrative Agent submitted to any
Bank with respect to amounts owing under this subsection (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If
such amount is so made available, such payment to the Administrative Agent shall constitute such Bank's Loan on
the date of Borrowing for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the
Administrative Agent on the Business Day following the Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent will notify the
applicable Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Administrative Agent, such Borrower shall
pay such amount to the Administrative Agent for the Administrative Agent's account, together with interest
thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate
applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

      (b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date shall not relieve any other Bank of
any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on such Borrowing Date, but no Bank shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on any Borrowing Date.

      <i>Section 2.13. Sharing of Payments, Etc.</i> If, other than as expressly provided elsewhere herein, any Bank
shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the
exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share, such Bank shall immediately
(a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other Banks such participations in
the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment pro rata
with each of them; <i>provided, however,</i> that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall
repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such paying Bank's required repayment to
(ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by
the purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrowers agree that any Bank so
purchasing a participation from another Bank may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off, but subject to Section 13.10) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the applicable Borrower in the amount of
such participation. The Administrative Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and binding in the
absence of manifest error) of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Banks following any such purchases or repayments.

                                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY</b>

      <i>Section 3.1. Taxes.</i> (a) <i>Payments to be Free and Clear.</i> All payments by each Borrower or any other Person
under the Loan Documents to or for the account of the Administrative Agent, or any Bank (each, an <i>"Indemnified
Tax Person"</i>) shall be made free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of,
any and all current or future taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities
with respect thereto (including interest, additions to tax, and penalties thereon) imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by the United States or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof (collectively,
<i>"Taxes"</i>), excluding as to any Indemnified Tax Person, (i) a Tax on the Income imposed on such Indemnified Tax
Person and (ii) any interest, fees, additions to tax or penalties for late payment thereof (each such nonexcluded
Tax, an <i>"Indemnified Tax"</i>). For purposes hereof, <i>"Tax on the Income"</i> shall mean, as to any Person, a
Tax imposed by one of the following jurisdictions or by any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof:
(i) the United States, (ii) the jurisdiction in which such Person is organized, (iii) the jurisdiction in which
such Person's principal office is located, or (iv) in the case of each Bank, any jurisdiction in which such
Bank's applicable Lending Office is located; which Tax is an income tax or franchise tax imposed on all or part
of the net income or net profits of such Person or which Tax represents interest, fees, or penalties for late
payment of such an income tax or franchise tax.

      (b) <i>Grossing Up of Payments.</i> If a Borrower or any other Person is required by law, rule, regulation,
order, directive, treaty or guideline to make any deduction or withholding (which deduction or withholding
would constitute an Indemnified Tax) from any amount required to be paid by it to or on behalf of an
Indemnified Tax Person under any Loan Document

                                                      -24-

(i) it shall pay such Indemnified Tax before the date on which penalties attach thereto, such payment to be
made for its own account (if the liability to pay is imposed on it) or on behalf of and in the name of such
Indemnified Tax Person (if the liability is imposed on such Indemnified Tax Person), and (ii) the sum payable
to such Indemnified Tax Person shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required
deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section) such Indemnified Tax Person receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no
such deductions or withholdings been made.

      (c) <i>Other Taxes.</i> Each Borrower or other Person agrees to pay any current or future stamp or documentary
taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies that arise from any payment made by it
hereunder or from the execution, delivery or registration of, or any amendment, supplement or modification of,
or any waiver or consent under or in respect of, the Loan Documents or otherwise with respect to, the Loan
Documents (collectively, the <i>"Other Taxes"</i>).

      (d) <i>Evidence of Payment.</i> Within 30 days after the reasonable request therefor by the Administrative
Agent in connection with any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the applicable Borrower or other
Person will furnish to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of an official receipt from
the jurisdiction to which payment is made evidencing payment thereof or, if unavailable, a certificate from a
Responsible Officer that states that such payment has been made and that sets forth the date and amount of such
payment.

      (e) <i>U.S. Tax Certificates.</i> Each Indemnified Tax Person that is organized under the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the United States or any political subdivision thereof that is exempt from United
States federal withholding tax, or that is subject to such tax at a reduced rate under an applicable treaty,
with respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrowers, on or prior to the Effective
Date (in the case of each Indemnified Tax Person listed on the signature pages hereof) or on the effective date
of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement or other document pursuant to which it becomes an Indemnified Tax
Person (in the case of each other Indemnified Tax Person), and at such other times as the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agent may reasonably request, Internal Revenue Form W-8 ECI or Form W-8 BEN or other certificate
or document required under United States law to establish entitlement to such exemption or reduced rate. No
Borrower shall be required to pay any additional amount to any such Indemnified Tax Person under subsection (b)
above if such Indemnified Tax Person shall have failed to satisfy the requirements of the immediately preceding
sentence with respect to such Borrower; <i>provided</i> that if such Indemnified Tax Person shall have satisfied such
requirements on the Effective Date (in the case of each Indemnified Tax Person listed on the signature pages
hereof) or on the effective date of the Assignment and Acceptance Agreement or other document pursuant to which
it became an Indemnified Tax Person (in the case of each other Indemnified Tax Person), nothing in this
subsection shall relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to pay any additional amounts pursuant to subsection
(b) in the event that, as a result of any change in applicable law or treaty, such Indemnified Tax Person is no
longer properly entitled to deliver certificates, documents or other evidence at a subsequent date establishing
the fact that such Indemnified Tax Person is no longer entitled to such exemption or reduced rate.

      <i>Section 3.2. Illegality.</i> (a) If any Bank determines that the introduction of any Requirement of Law, or
any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has
made it unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Bank or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the
Bank to the Borrowers through the Administrative Agent, any obligation of that Bank to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until the Bank notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

      (b) If a Bank determines that it is unlawful to maintain any Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrowers shall,
upon receipt of notice of such fact and demand from such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay
in full such Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon and
amounts required under Section 3.4, either on the last day of the Interest Period thereof, if the Bank may
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If a Borrower is required to so prepay any Eurodollar
Rate Loan, then concurrently with such prepayment, such Borrower shall borrow from the affected Bank, in the
amount of such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.

      <i>Section 3.3. Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.</i> (a) If any Bank determines that, due to either (i)
the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition of or increase in reserve
requirements included in the calculation of the Eurodollar Rate or in respect of the assessment rate payable by
any Bank to the FDIC for insuring U.S. deposits) in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
the compliance by that Bank with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank of agreeing to
make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans, then the Borrowers shall be liable for, and
shall from time to time, upon demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Administrative Agent), pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate
such Bank for such increased costs.

      (b) If any Bank shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii)
any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any
Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Bank (or its Lending Office) or any corporation
controlling the Bank with any Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation controlling the Bank and (taking into
consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's
desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its
Commitment, loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Bank to the Parent
through the Administrative Agent, the Parent shall pay to the Bank, from time to time as specified by the Bank,
additional amounts sufficient to compensate the Bank for such increase.

      <i>Section 3.4. Funding Losses.</i> Each Borrower shall reimburse each Bank and hold each Bank harmless from
any loss or expense which the Bank may sustain or incur as a consequence of:

            (a) the failure of such Borrower to make on a timely basis any payment of principal of any
      Eurodollar Rate Loan;

            (b) the failure of such Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Loan after such Borrower has
      given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice of Conversion/Continuation;

            (c) the failure of such Borrower to make any prepayment in accordance with any notice delivered
      under Section 2.6;

            (d) the prepayment or other payment (including after acceleration thereof) of an Eurodollar Rate
      Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

            (e) the automatic conversion under Section 2.4 of any Eurodollar Rate Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a
      day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to
maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained. For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrowers to the Banks under this Section and
under subsection 3.3(a), each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a Bank (and each related reserve, special deposit or
similar requirement) shall be conclusively deemed to have been funded at the LIBOR Rate used in determining the
Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other borrowing in the interbank
eurodollar market for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan
is in fact so funded.

      <i>Section 3.5. Inability to Determine Rates.</i> If the Majority Banks determine that for any reason adequate
and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or that the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to subsection
2.8(a) for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to the Banks of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify
the Borrowers and each Bank. Thereafter, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans,
as the case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the
Majority Banks revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, each Borrower may revoke any Notice
of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the applicable Borrower does not
revoke such Notice, the Banks shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by such Borrower, in the
amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the applicable Borrower, but such Loans shall be made,
converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of Eurodollar Rate Loans,

      <i>Section 3.6. Certificates of Banks.</i> Any Bank or Agent claiming reimbursement or compensation under this
Article III shall deliver to the applicable Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a certificate
setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable to the Bank or Agent hereunder and such certificate shall
be conclusive and binding on such Borrower in the absence of manifest error.

      <i>Section 3.7. Survival.</i> The agreements and obligations of the Borrowers in this Article III shall survive
the payment of all other Obligations.

                 execution and delivery by each of the Parent, PLIC and PXP of the Loan Documents to which it
                 is a party, and the performance by each of the Parent, PLIC and PXP of its obligations under

      proceeds of the initial Borrowing hereunder). Each Bank party hereto which is also a lender party to the
      Existing Credit Agreement hereby waives any requirements set forth in the Existing Credit Agreement to
      which it is a party for prior notice of the termination of the commitments thereunder and/or the
      repayment of the loans and/or fees due thereunder to the extent, but only to the extent, that the
      termination of such commitments and/or the repayment of such loans is occurring substantially
      concurrently with this Agreement becoming effective. The foregoing waivers shall not (i) constitute a
      waiver of any condition or requirement of any Existing Credit Agreement that payments of principal or
      interest be received by a certain time on the date of payment in order to avoid the imposition of
      additional interest for the payment date and for any non-business days immediately following the payment
      date and (ii) the foregoing waiver shall not preclude the right of the banks party to the Existing Credit
      Agreement to be compensated, in accordance with the terms of the Existing Credit Agreement, for any loss,
      cost or expense (including loss of profit) incident to the prepayment of the loans outstanding thereunder
      which bears interest at a fixed rate and which is being prepaid on a day other than a date which,
      pursuant to the terms of the applicable Existing Credit Agreement, would avoid the requirement that the
      applicable Borrower reimburse such banks for such losses, costs or expenses.

      <i>Section 4.2. Conditions to All Borrowings.</i> The obligation of each Bank to make any Loan to be made by it
(including its initial Loan) is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent on the
relevant Borrowing Date:

            (a) <i>Notice of Borrowing.</i> The Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice of Borrowing;

            (b) <i>Continuation of Representations and Warranties.</i> The representations and warranties in Article V
      shall be true and correct on and as of such Borrowing Date with the same effect as if made on and as of
      such Borrowing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly refer to an
      earlier date); and

            (c) <i>No Existing Default.</i> No Event of Default or Default shall exist or shall result from such
      Borrowing.

Each Notice of Borrowing submitted hereunder shall constitute a representation and warranty by the applicable
Borrower hereunder, as of the date of each such notice and as of each Borrowing Date, that the conditions in
Section 4.2 are satisfied.

the case of clause (i) of subsection (g) upon the expiration of the 60-day period mentioned therein) with
respect to the Parent, PLIC, PXP or any other Primary Subsidiary, the obligation of each Bank to make Loans
shall automatically terminate and the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding Loans and all interest and
other amounts as aforesaid shall automatically become due and payable without further act of the Administrative
Agent or any Bank.

      <i>Section 11.3. Rights Not Exclusive.</i> The rights provided for in this Agreement and the other Loan

privileges or remedies provided by law or in equity, or under any other instrument, document or agreement now
existing or hereafter arising.


                                                  <b>ARTICLE XII

                                            THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT</b>

      <i>Section 12.1. Appointment.</i> Subject to Section 12.9 hereof, each Bank hereby irrevocably designates and
appoints BMO as the Administrative Agent of such Bank under the Loan Documents and each Bank hereby irrevocably
authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of the Loan
Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to the Administrative
Agent by the terms of the Loan Documents, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
duties of the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature, and, notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary elsewhere in any Loan Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities other than those expressly set forth therein, or any fiduciary relationship with, or fiduciary
duty to, any Bank, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities
shall be read into the Loan Documents or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.

      <i>Section 12.2. Delegation of Duties.</i> The Administrative Agent may execute any of its duties under the Loan
Documents by or through agents or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully
protected in, and shall not be under any liability for, relying upon, the advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties.

      <i>Section 12.3. Exculpatory Provisions.</i> Neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents attorneys-in-fact, or affiliates shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken
or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with the Loan Documents (except the
Administrative Agent for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) responsible in any manner to
any of the Banks for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by the Parent, PLIC or PXP or
any officer thereof contained in the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Administrative Agent under or in connection with, the Loan
Documents or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, perfection, enforceability or sufficiency of
any of the Loan Documents or for any failure of the Parent, PLIC, PXP or any other Person to perform its
obligations thereunder. The Administrative Agent shall not be under any obligation to any Bank to ascertain or
to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, the
Loan Documents, or to inspect the property, books or records of the Parent, PLIC or PXP. The Banks acknowledge
that the Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to take any discretionary action permitted under the
Loan Documents unless the Administrative Agent shall be instructed in writing to do so by the Majority Banks
and such instructions shall be binding on the Banks and all holders of any Obligations; <i>provided, however,</i> that
the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to
personal liability or is contrary to law or any provision of the Loan Documents. The Administrative Agent shall
not be under any liability or responsibility whatsoever, as Administrative Agent, to the Parent, PLIC, PXP or
any other

                                                      -50-
<PAGE>

Person as a consequence of any failure or delay in performance, or any breach, by any Bank of any of its
obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

      <i>Section 12.4. Reliance by Administrative Agent.</i> The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit,
opinion, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document
or conversation in good faith believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by
a proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without limitation,
counsel to Parent, PLIC or PXP), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Administrative
Agent. The Administrative Agent may treat each Bank, or the Person designated in the last notice filed with it
under this Section, as the holder of all of the interests of such Bank, in its Loans and Notes, until written
notice of transfer, signed by such Bank (or the Person designated in the last notice filed with the
Administrative Agent) and by the Person designated in such written notice of transfer, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent shall not be under any duty to examine or pass upon the validity, effectiveness,
enforceability or genuineness of the Loan Documents or any instrument, document or communication furnished
pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to assume that the
same are valid, effective and genuine, have been signed or sent by the proper parties and are what they purport
to be. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under the
Loan Documents unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Majority Banks as it deems
appropriate. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, under the Loan Documents in accordance with a request or direction of the Majority Banks, and such
request or direction and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all the
Banks and all future holders of the Notes.

      <i>Section 12.5. Notice of Default.</i> The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice
of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received written
notice thereof from a Bank or a Borrower. In the event that the Administrative Agent receives such a notice,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Banks and the Parent, PLIC and PXP. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall be
directed by the Majority Banks; <i>provided, however,</i> that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have
received such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall deem to be in the
best interests of the Banks.

      <i>Section 12.6. Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Banks.</i> Each Bank expressly acknowledges that
neither the Administrative Agent nor any of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter, including any review of the affairs of the Parent, PLIC and PXP, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent to any Bank. Each Bank
represents to the Administrative Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative
Agent or any Bank, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
evaluation of and investigation into the business, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Parent, PLIC and PXP and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank
also represents that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any

                                                      -51-
<PAGE>

Bank, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make
its own credit analysis, evaluations and decisions in taking or not taking action under any Loan Document, and
to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Parent, PLIC and PXP. Except for notices, reports and
other documents expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide the Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of
the Parent, PLIC or PXP which at any time may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or any of
its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or affiliates.

      <i>Section 12.7. Indemnification.</i> Each Bank agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent
in its capacity as such (to the extent not promptly reimbursed by the Parent, PLIC and PXP and without limiting
the obligation of the Parent, PLIC and PXP to do so), pro rata according to the aggregate of the outstanding
principal balance of the Loans (or at any time when no Loans are outstanding, according to its Pro Rata Share),
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever, including, without limitation, any amounts paid to the
Banks (through the Administrative Agent) by any of the Parent, PLIC or PXP pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents, that are subsequently rescinded or avoided, or must otherwise be restored or returned) which may at
any time (including, without limitation, at any time following the payment of the Loans or the Notes) be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating to or arising out of
the Loan Documents or any other documents contemplated by or referred to therein or the transactions
contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the Administrative Agent under or in
connection with any of the foregoing; <i>provided, however,</i> that no Bank shall be liable for the payment of any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements to the extent resulting solely from the finally adjudicated gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank agrees to
reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its pro rata share of any unpaid fees owing to the
Administrative Agent, and any costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel) payable by the Parent, PLIC or PXP under Section 13.4, to the extent that the Administrative Agent
has not been paid such fees or has not been reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Parent, PLIC or PXP.
The failure of any Bank to reimburse the Administrative Agent promptly upon demand for its pro rata share of
any amount required to be paid by the Banks to the Administrative Agent as provided in this Section shall not
relieve any other Bank of its obligation hereunder to reimburse the Administrative Agent for its pro rata share
of such amount, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to reimburse the
Administrative Agent for such other Bank's pro rata share of such amount. If, after having been indemnified or
reimbursed by the Banks as provided by this Section, the Administrative Agent shall have received payment

                                                      -52-
<PAGE>

from the obligor in respect of the obligation or liability for which it received such indemnification or
reimbursement from the Banks, the Administrative Agent shall disburse to the Banks an amount equal to the
amount of the payment so received on a pro rata basis. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
termination of the Commitments of all of the Banks, and the payment of all amounts payable under the Loan
Documents.

      <i>Section 12.8. Administrative Agent in Its Individual Capacity.</i> BMO and its affiliates may make secured or
unsecured loans to, accept deposits from, issue letters of credit for the account of, act as trustee under
indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Parent, PLIC, PLP or their Subsidiaries
as though BMO were not an Agent hereunder. With respect to the Commitment made or renewed by BMO and the
Obligations owing it, BMO shall have the same rights and powers under the Loan Documents as any Bank and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the terms <i>"Bank"</i> and <i>"Banks"</i> shall in
each case include BMO.

      <i>Section 12.9. Successor Administrative Agent.</i> If at any time the Administrative Agent deems it advisable,
in its discretion, it may submit to the Banks a written notice of its resignation as Administrative Agent under
the Loan Documents, such resignation to be effective upon the earlier of (i) the written acceptance of the
duties of the Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents by a successor Administrative Agent and (ii) on the
30th day after the date of such notice. Upon any such resignation, the Majority Banks shall have the right to
appoint from among the Banks a successor Administrative Agent. If no successor Administrative Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Majority Banks and accepted such appointment in writing within 30 days after the
retiring Administrative Agent's giving of notice of resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on
behalf of the Bank, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which successor Administrative Agent shall be a
commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States or any State thereof and having a
combined capital, surplus, and undivided profits of at least $500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor
Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and
duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent's rights, powers, privileges
and duties as Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents shall be terminated. The Parent, PLIC, PXP and the
Banks shall execute such documents as shall be necessary to effect such appointment. After any retiring
Administrative Agent's resignation as Administrative Agent, the provisions of the Loan Documents shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it, and any amounts owing to it, while it was
Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents. If at any time there shall not be a duly appointed and acting
Administrative Agent, the Parent, PLIC and PXP agree to make each payment due under the Loan Documents directly
to the Banks entitled thereto during such time.

      <i>Section 12.10. Syndication Agent and Documentation Agent.</i> The Banks identified on the facing page or
signature pages of this Agreement as a "syndication agent" or "documentation agent" shall have no right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those applicable to all Banks as
such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Banks so identified as a "co-agent" or "lead manager" shall
have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Bank or the Parent, PLIC or PXP. Each Bank

                                                      -53-
<PAGE>

acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the Banks so identified in deciding to enter
into this Agreement or in taking or not taking action hereunder. The parties identified on the facing pages
hereof as having arranged this transaction are not parties to this Agreement and have no liabilities hereunder.

      <i>Section 13.1. Amendments and Waivers.</i> No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, and no consent with respect to any departure by the Parent, PLIC or PXP therefrom, shall
be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Majority Banks (or by the Administrative
Agent at the written request of the Majority Banks) and the Parent, PLIC and PXP and acknowledged by the
Administrative Agent, and then any such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and
for the specific purpose for which given; <i>provided, however,</i> that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, the Parent, PLIC and PXP and acknowledged by the Administrative
Agent, do any of the following:

            (a) increase or extend the Commitment of any Bank (or reinstate any Commitment terminated pursuant
      to Section 11.2);

            (b) postpone or delay any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan Document for any payment
      of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to the Banks (or any of them) hereunder or under any
      other Loan Document;

            (c) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on any Loan, or any fees or
      other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document;

            (d) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the
      Loans which is required for the Banks or any of them to take any action hereunder;

            (e) amend this Section, or Section 2.13 or any provision herein providing for consent or other
      action by all Banks; or

            (f) amend or terminate any guaranty, including the guaranties pursuant to Article X;

and, <i>provided, further</i>, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Majority Banks or all the Banks, as the case may be, affect the rights
or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

      <i>Section 13.2. Notices.</i> (a) All notices, requests and other communications under the Loan Documents
shall be in writing (including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, by

facsimile transmission, <i>provided</i> that any matter transmitted by the Parent, PLIC or PXP by facsimile (i) shall
be immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the number specified on the signature pages
hereof or on an Assignment and Acceptance to which it is a party, and (ii) shall be followed promptly by
delivery of a hard-copy original thereof) and mailed, faxed or delivered, to the address or facsimile number
specified for notices on the signature pages hereof or on an Assignment and Acceptance to which it is a party;
or, as directed to the Parent, PLIC, PXP or the Administrative Agent, to such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties, and as directed to any other party, at such
other address as shall be designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties.

      (b) All such notices, requests and communications shall, when transmitted by overnight delivery, or
faxed, be effective when delivered for overnight (next-day) delivery, or transmitted in legible form by
facsimile machine, respectively, or, if mailed, upon the third Business Day after the date deposited into the
U.S. mail, or, if delivered, upon delivery; except that notices pursuant to Article II or XII shall not be
effective until actually received by the Administrative Agent.

      (c) Any agreement of the Administrative Agent and the Banks herein to receive certain notices by
telephone or facsimile is solely for the convenience and at the request of the Parent, PLIC and/or PXP. The
Administrative Agent and the Banks shall be entitled to rely on the authority of any Person purporting to be a
Person authorized by the Parent, PLIC and/or PXP to give such notice and the Administrative Agent and the Banks
shall not have any liability to the Parent, PLIC, PXP or other Persons on account of any action taken or not
taken by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The
obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Loans shall not be affected in any way or to any extent by any failure
by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice
or the receipt by the Administrative Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with the terms
understood by the Administrative Agent and the Banks to be contained in the telephonic or facsimile notice.

      <i>Section 13.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.</i> No failure to exercise and no delay in exercising, on the
part of the Administrative Agent or any Bank, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder, shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.

      <i>Section 13.4. Costs and Expenses.</i> The Borrowers shall:

            (a) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, pay or reimburse BMO for
      all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by BMO in connection with the development, preparation,
      delivery, administration and execution of, and any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in
      each case, whether or not consummated), this Agreement, any Loan Document and any other documents
      prepared in connection herewith or therewith, and the consummation of the transactions

                                                      -55-

      contemplated hereby and thereby, including reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by BMO with respect
      thereto; and

            (b) pay or reimburse each Agent, the Arrangers and each Bank for all costs and expenses (including
      reasonable Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or
      preservation of any rights or remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document during the
      existence of an Event of Default or after acceleration of the Loans (including in connection with any
      "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and including in any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate
      proceeding).

      <i>Section 13.5. Indemnity.</i> Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, the Parent,
PLIC and PXP shall indemnify and hold the Agent-Related Persons, and each Bank and each of its respective
officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an <i>"Indemnified Person"</i>) harmless
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may at any time (including at any time following repayment of the Loans and the termination, resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent or replacement of any Bank) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against any such Person in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by
or referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken or omitted by any such
Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect to any investigation,
litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or arising
out of this Agreement or the Loans or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is
a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the <i>"Indemnified Liabilities"</i>); <i>provided,</i> that the Parent,
PLIC and PXP shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified
Liabilities resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person; and
<i>provided, further,</i> that the Indemnified Persons shall, at the request of the Parent, PLIC and PXP only use one
counsel among them unless any such Indemnified Person determines in its sole discretion that its interests may
differ from any other Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other
Obligations.

      <i>Section 13.6. Payments Set Aside.</i> To the extent that any of the Parent, PLIC or PXP makes a payment to
the Administrative Agent or the Banks, or the Administrative Agent or the Banks exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered
into by the Administrative Agent or such Bank in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery
the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force
and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b) each Bank severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent upon demand its <i>pro rata</i> share of any amount so recovered from or
repaid by the Administrative Agent.

      <i>Section 13.7. Successors and Assigns.</i> The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Parent, PLIC and
PXP may not assign or transfer any of their rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Bank.

      <i>Section 13.8. Assignments, Participations, etc.</i> (a) Any Bank may, subject to the written consent of the
Borrowers at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default, and the Administrative Agent,
which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, at any time assign and delegate to one or more Eligible
Assignees (<i>provided</i> that no written consent of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent shall be required in
connection with any assignment and delegation by a Bank to an Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate of such
Bank and the assignee need not be an Eligible Assignee if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing)
(each an <i>"Assignee"</i>) all, or any ratable part of all, of the Loans, the Commitments and the other rights and
obligations of such Bank hereunder, in a minimum amount such that the Assignee after giving effect to such
assignment shall hold at least $5,000,000 of the Commitments (or if less the aggregate amount of the
Commitments of the Bank so assigning); <i>provided, however,</i> that the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent may
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with the interest so assigned to an Assignee
until (i) written notice of such assignment, together with payment instructions, addresses and related
information with respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent
by such Bank and the Assignee; (ii) such Bank and its Assignee shall have delivered to the Borrowers and the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit E or in such other form as shall be
acceptable to them (<i>"Assignment and Acceptance"</i>) and (iii) the assignor Bank or Assignee has paid to the
Administrative Agent a processing fee in the amount of $3,500 (such processing fee to be payable, without
limitation, in connection with assignments from a Bank to another Bank).

      (b) From and after the date that the Administrative Agent notifies the assignor Bank that it has received
(and <i>provided</i> its consent with respect to) an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the
above-referenced processing fee, (i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, shall
have the rights and obligations of a Bank under the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Bank shall, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned by it
pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under
the Loan Documents.

      (c) Within five Business Days after its receipt of notice by the Administrative Agent that it has
received an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the processing fee, (and <i>provided</i> that it
consents to such assignment in accordance with subsection 13.8(a)), the Borrowers shall at the request of the
Assignee execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent, a new Note evidencing such Assignee's assigned Loans
and Commitment. Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee payment under the Assignment and
Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to
reflect the addition of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising

                                                      -57-

therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitment of the assigning Bank <i>pro
tanto</i>.

      (d) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks or other Persons not Affiliates of the
Borrowers (a <i>"Participant"</i>) participating interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Bank and the other
interests of that Bank (the <i>"originating Bank"</i>) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents; <i>provided,
however,</i> that (i) the originating Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the
originating Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations, (iii) the Borrowers
and the Administrative Agent shall continue to deal solely and directly with the originating Bank in connection
with the originating Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and (iv)
no Bank shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which the Participant has rights to approve
any amendment to, or any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except
to the extent such amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous consent of the Banks as described in
the first proviso to Section 13.1. In the case of any such participation, the Participant shall be entitled to
the benefit of Sections 3.1, 3.3 and 13.5 as though it were also a Bank hereunder, and not have any other
rights under this Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, and all amounts payable by the Borrowers
hereunder shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation; except that, if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared or shall have become due and
payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of
set-off in respect of its participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent as if
the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement.

      (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Bank may at any time create a security
interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of its rights under and interest in this Agreement and the Note held
by it in favor of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S. Treasury
Regulation 31 CFR ss.203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce such pledge or security interest in any
manner permitted under applicable law.

      (f) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Bank, (a <i>"Granting Lender"</i>) may
grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an <i>"SPV"</i>), identified as such in writing from time to time by such
Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers, the option to fund all or any part of any Loan
that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to fund pursuant to this Credit Agreement; <i>provided</i> that
(aa) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to fund any Loan, (ab) if an SPV elects not to
exercise such option or otherwise fails to fund all or any part of such Loan, the Granting Lender shall be
obligated to fund such Loan pursuant to the terms hereof, (ac) no SPV shall have any voting rights pursuant to
Section 13.1 and (ad) with respect to notices, payments and other matters hereunder, the Borrowers, the
Administrative Agent and the Banks shall not be obligated to deal with an SPV, but may limit their
communications and other dealings relevant to such SPV to the applicable Granting Lender. The funding of a Loan
by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent that, and as if,
such Loan were funded by such Granting Lender.

           (ii) As to any Loans or portion thereof made by it, each SPV shall have all the rights that its
applicable Granting Lender making such Loans or portion thereof would have had under this Credit Agreement;
<i>provided, however,</i> that each SPV shall have granted to its Granting Lender an irrevocable power of attorney, to
deliver and receive all communications and notices under this Agreement (and any related documents) and to
exercise on such SPV's behalf, all of such SPV's voting rights under this Credit Agreement. No additional Note
shall be required to evidence the Loans or portion thereof made by an SPV; and the related Granting Lender
shall be deemed to hold its Note as agent for such SPV to the extent of the Loans or portion thereof funded by
such SPV. In addition. any payments for the account of any SPV shall be paid to its Granting Lender as agent
for such SPV.

          (iii) Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any indemnity or payment under
this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable for so long as, and to the extent, the Granting
Lender provides such indemnity or makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby
agrees (which agreements shall survive the termination of this Credit Agreement) that, prior to the date that
is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior
indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such
SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceeding under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof.

           (iv) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject
to the other provisions of Section 13.8(f), any SPV may (i) at any time and without paying any processing fee
therefor, assign or participate all or a portion of its Loans to the Granting Lender or to any financial
institutions providing liquidity and/or credit support to or for the account of such SPV to support the funding
or maintenance of Loans and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information relating to its
Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity
enhancements to such SPV. This Section 13.8(f) may not be amended without the written consent of any Granting
Lender affected thereby if the existence of such Granting Lender has been identified to the Borrowers and
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 13.8(f)(i).

      <i>Section 13.9. Confidentiality.</i> Each Bank agrees to take and to cause its Affiliates to take normal
and reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified
as "confidential" or "secret" by the Parent, PLIC or PXP and provided to it by the Parent, PLIC or PXP or any
other Subsidiary, or by any Agent or the Arrangers on their behalf, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and neither it nor any of its Affiliates shall use any such information other than in connection with
the enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or in connection with other business now or
hereafter existing or contemplated with the Parent, PLIC, PXP or any Subsidiary thereof; except to the extent
such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by
the Bank, or (ii) was or becomes available on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Parent, PLIC
or PXP, <i>provided</i> that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Parent, PLIC or PXP
known to the Bank; <i>provided, however,</i> that any Bank may disclose such information (A) at the request or
pursuant to any requirement of any Governmental Authority to which the Bank is subject or in connection with
an examination of


                                                      -59-

such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (C) when required to do
so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Administrative Agent, any Bank or their
respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of
any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (F) to such Bank's independent auditors and other
professional advisors; (G) to any Participant or Assignee, actual or potential, <i>provided</i> that such Person
agrees in writing to keep such information confidential to the same extent required of the Banks hereunder; (H)
as to any Bank or its Affiliate, as expressly permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement
regarding confidentiality to which the Parent or any Subsidiary is party or is deemed party with such Bank or
such Affiliate; and (I) to its Affiliates.

      <i>Section 13.10. Set-off.</i> In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks provided by law, if an
Event of Default exists or the Loans have been accelerated, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time
to time, without prior notice to the Parent, PLIC or PXP, any such notice being waived by the Parent, PLIC and
PXP to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Bank to
or for the credit or the account of any of the Parent, PLIC or PXP against any and all obligations owing to
such Bank by the depositor, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Administrative Agent
or such Bank shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although such Obligations may
be contingent or unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the applicable party and the Administrative
Agent after any such set-off and application made by such Bank; <i>provided, however,</i> that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

      <i>Section 13.11. Automatic Debits of Fees.</i> With respect to any fee, or any other cost or expense
(including Attorney Costs) due and payable to the Agents or the Arrangers under the Loan Documents, the Parent,
PLIC and PXP hereby irrevocably authorize them to debit any deposit account of an obligor in an amount such
that the aggregate amount debited from all such deposit accounts does not exceed such fee or other cost or
expense. If there are insufficient funds in such deposit accounts to cover the amount of the fee or other cost
or expense then due, such debits will be reversed (in whole or in part, in the debtor's sole discretion) and
such amount not debited shall be deemed to be unpaid. No such debit under this Section shall be deemed a
set-off.

      <i>Section 13.12. Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc.</i> Each Bank shall notify the
Administrative Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to the Bank should be directed,
of addresses of any Lending Office, of payment instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it
hereunder and of such other administrative information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request.

      <i>Section 13.13. Counterparts.</i> This Agreement may be executed in any number of separate counterparts, each
of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be
deemed to constitute but one and the same instrument.

      <i>Section 13.14. Severability.</i> The illegality or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement
or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in any way affect or impair the legality or
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

      <i>Section 13.15. No Third Parties Benefits.</i> This Agreement is made and entered into for the sole
protection and legal benefit of the Parent, PLIC, PXP, the Banks, the Agents and the Agent-Related Persons, and
their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of,
or have any direct or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents.

      <i>Section 13.16. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.</i> (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; <i>PROVIDED</i> THAT THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS
SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

      (b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE
BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK,
AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE PARENT, PLIC, PXP, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS

HERETO. THE PARENT, PLIC, PXP, THE AGENTS AND THE BANKS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT
OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY NEW YORK LAW.

      <i>Section 13.17. Waiver of Jury Trial.</i> THE PARENT, PLIC, PXP, THE BANKS AND THE AGENTS EACH WAIVE
THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY

                                               December 23, 2002



 To:  Fleet National Bank as Syndication Agent, Bank of
      Montreal, as Administrative Agent, and the other
      Bank parties from time to time to the Credit
      Agreement hereinafter referred to

       Re: Credit Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2002, among The Phoenix
              Companies, Inc., Phoenix Life Insurance Company, Phoenix
          Investment Partners, Ltd., and the Financial Institutions Party
          Thereto, Fleet National Bank, as Syndication Agent, and Bank of
             Montreal, as Administrative Agent (the <i>"Credit Agreement"</i>)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      The undersigned has acted as counsel for Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd. (<i>"PXP"</i>) in connection with
the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents. This opinion
letter is delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(v) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise defined herein or
the context otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in this opinion letter shall have the respective
meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

      I have reviewed the corporate proceedings taken by PXP in connection with the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. In addition, I have examined and relied upon copies of such Credit Agreement, the Charter
and the Bylaws of PXP as in effect on the date hereof, copies of supporting resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors of PXP in connection with the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
certificates executed by officers of PXP addressing facts material to my opinions as I consider necessary or
appropriate for the basis of the opinions expressed.

      In making the examination of such agreements and instruments in connection with the opinions expressed
herein, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those on behalf of PXP) and the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all
documents submitted to me as copies and have further assumed that each of the Banks has the corporate power to
enter into and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and have assumed with respect to each of them
due authorization by all requisite corporate action, due execution and delivery and the valid and binding
effect of such documents and agreements and compliance by the Banks with applicable law. I am admitted to

<PAGE>

practice law only in the State of Connecticut and as to matters involving New York law, I have assumed that the
law of the State of New York is identical to the law of the State of Connecticut.

      Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

            (1) PXP is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
      the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has full corporate power and authority to own and hold under
      lease its property and to conduct its business substantially as currently conducted by it. PXP has full
      corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under each Loan Document to which
      it is a party.

            (2) PXP's execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party are
      PXP's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not:

                 a. contravene PXP's Charter or Bylaws;

                 b. contravene any relevant law;

                 c. to the best of my knowledge, contravene any relevant order;

                 d. to the best of my knowledge, conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or
            the creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which PXP is
            a party; or

                 e. result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any Lien on PXP's property under any
            relevant law or relevant order.

            (3) No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
      Governmental Authority is required for PXP's due execution, delivery or performance of the Loan Documents
      to which it is a party.

            (4) The Loan Documents to which PXP is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
      of PXP, enforceable against PXP in accordance with their terms.

      With respect to matters of fact on which my opinion is based, I have relied on appropriate certificates
of public officials and officers of PXP and I have no reason to believe such certificates are inaccurate. My
opinion is limited to the laws of the United States of America, the State of Connecticut, the general corporate
law of the States of Delaware and (as qualified herein) New York.

      This opinion letter is rendered solely for the Agents' and the Banks' benefit in connection with the
above transaction. Without my prior written consent, this opinion letter may not be: (i) relied upon by any
other party or for any other purpose; (ii) quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to in any report or
document; or (iii) furnished (the original or copies thereof) to any party except in connection with the
enforcement of the Loan Documents by the Agents or


                                                      -2-

To:   Fleet National Bank as Syndication Agent, Bank of Montreal, as
      Administrative Agent and the other Bank parties from time to time to the
      Credit Agreement hereinafter referred to


      Re:  Credit Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2002, among The Phoenix
           Companies, Inc., Phoenix Life Mutual Insurance Company, Phoenix
           Investment Partners, Ltd., and the Financial Institutions Party
           Thereto, Fleet National Bank, as Syndication Agent and Bank of
           Montreal, as Administrative Agent (the <i>"Credit Agreement"</i>).

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      The undersigned has acted as Vice President and Counsel of Phoenix Life Insurance Company (<i>"PLI"</i>) in
connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
This opinion letter is delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(v) of the Credit Agreement. Unless otherwise
defined herein or the context otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in this opinion letter shall have
the respective meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

      I have reviewed the corporate proceedings taken by PLI in connection with the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. In addition, I have examined and relied upon copies of such Credit Agreement, the Charter
and the Bylaws of PLI as in effect on the date hereof, copies of supporting resolutions adopted by the. Board
of Directors of PLI in connection with the Credit Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and
certificates executed by officers of PLI addressing facts material to my opinions as I consider necessary or
appropriate for the basis of the opinions expressed.

      In making the examination of such agreements and instruments in connection with the opinions expressed
herein, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those on behalf of PLI) and the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all
documents submitted to me as copies and have further assumed that each of the Banks has the corporate power to
enter into and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and have assumed with respect to each of them
due authorization by all requisite corporate action, due execution and delivery and the valid and binding
effect of such documents and agreements and compliance by the Banks with applicable law. I am admitted to
practice law only in the State of Connecticut and as to matters involving New York law other

<PAGE>

than matters relating to the organization, existence and corporate powers of PLI, I have assumed that the law
of the State of New York is identical to the law of the State of Connecticut.

      Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

            (1) PLI is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
      the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has full corporate power and authority to own and hold under
      lease its property and to conduct its business substantially as currently conducted by it. PLI has full
      corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under each Loan Document to which
      it is a party.

            (2) PLI's execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party are
      within PLI's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not:

                 a. contravene PLI's Charter or Bylaws;

                 b. contravene any relevant law;

                 c. to the best of my knowledge, contravene any relevant order;

                 d. to the best of my knowledge, conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or
            the creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which PLI is
            a party; or

                 e. result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any Lien on PLI's property under any
            relevant law or relevant order.

            (3) No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
      Governmental Authority is required for PLI's due execution, delivery or performance of the Loan Documents
      to which it is a party.

            (4) The Loan Documents to which PLI is a party constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation
      of PLI, enforceable against PLI in accordance with their terms, except as such terms may be limited by
      bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, and legal and equitable principles, affecting or limiting the
      enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

      With respect to matters of fact on which my opinion is based, I have relied on appropriate certificates
of public officials and officers of PLI and I have no reason to believe such certificates are inaccurate. My
opinion is limited to the laws of the United States of America, the State of Connecticut, the general corporate
law of the State of (as qualified herein) New York.

      This opinion letter is rendered solely for the Agents' and the Banks' benefit in connection with the
above transaction. Without my prior written consent, this opinion letter may not be: (i) relied upon by any
other party or for any other purpose; (ii) quoted in whole or in part or

party except in connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents by the Agents of the Banks; <i>provided,

participants (actual or potential) in the Loans and pursuant to the requirements of process.

To:   Fleet National Bank as Syndication Agent, Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent and the other Bank
      parties from time to time to the Credit Agreement hereinafter referred to


      Re:  Credit Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2002, among The Phoenix Companies,
           Inc., Phoenix Life Insurance Company, Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., and
           the Financial Institutions Party Thereto, Fleet National Bank, as Syndication
           Agent and Bank of Montreal, as Administrative Agent (the <i>"Credit Agreement"</i>).

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      The undersigned has acted as Senior Vice President and General Counsel of The Phoenix Companies, Inc.
(<i>"PCI"</i>) and Phoenix Life Insurance Company (<i>"PLI"</i>), which is the parent of Phoenix Investment Partners,
Ltd. (<i>"PXP"</i>), in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the other
Loan Documents. This opinion letter is delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(v) of the Credit Agreement. Unless
otherwise defined herein or the context otherwise requires, all capitalized terms used in this opinion letter
shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.

      I have reviewed the corporate proceedings taken by PCI in connection with the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. In addition, I have examined and relied upon copies of such Credit Agreement, the Pledge
Agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws of PCI as in effect on the date hereof, copies of
supporting resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors of PCI in connection with the Credit Agreement and
Pledge Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and certificates executed by officers of PCI
addressing facts material to my opinions as I consider necessary or appropriate for the basis of the opinions
expressed.

      In making the examination of such agreements and instruments in connection with the opinions expressed
herein, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures (other than those on behalf of PCI) and the
authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals and the conformity with the originals of all
documents submitted to me as copies and have further assumed that each of the Banks has the corporate power to
enter into and perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement and have assumed with respect to each of them
due authorization by all requisite corporate action, due execution and delivery and the valid and binding
effect of such documents and agreements and compliance by the Banks with applicable law.

<PAGE>

      Based upon and subject to the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

            (1) PCI is a corporation, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
      the jurisdiction of its incorporation, and has full corporate power and authority to own and hold under
      lease its property and to conduct its business substantially as currently conducted by it. PCI has full
      corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under each Loan Document to which
      it is a party.

            (2) PCI's execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to which it is a party are
      within PCI's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and do not:

                 a. contravene PCI's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws;

                 b. contravene any relevant law;

                 c. to the best of my knowledge, contravene any relevant order;

                 d. to the best of my knowledge, conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or
            the creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which PCI is
            a party; or

                 e. result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any Lien on PCI's property under any
            relevant law or relevant order.

            (3) No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any
      Governmental Authority is required for PCI's due execution, delivery or performance of the Loan Documents
      to which it is a party.

            (4) The Loan Documents to which PCI, PLI and PXP are parties constitute the legal, valid and
      binding obligations of PCI, PLI and PXP enforceable against PCI, PLI and PXP in accordance with their
      terms, except as such terms may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws, and legal and
      equitable principles, affecting or limiting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally. In rendering
      the foregoing opinions with respect to PLI and PXP, I have relied upon paragraphs 1 and 2 of the opinions
      of Nancy J. Engberg Esq. and John T. Mulrain Esq. to you of even date herewith.

      With respect to matters of fact on which my opinion is based, I have relied on appropriate certificates
of public officials and officers of PCI and I have no reason to believe such certificates are inaccurate. My
opinion is limited to the laws of the United States of America, the States of New York and Connecticut and the
general corporate law of the State of Delaware.
